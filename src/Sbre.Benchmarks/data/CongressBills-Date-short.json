FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) at the outset of the 20th century, the States adopted a \n        separate justice system for juvenile offenders;\n            (2) violent crimes committed by juveniles, such as \n        homicide, rape, and robbery, were an unknown phenomenon then, \n        but the rate at which juveniles commit such crimes has \n        escalated astronomically since that time;\n            (3) in 1994--\n                    (A) the number of persons arrested overall for \n                murder in the United States decreased by 5.8 percent, \n                but the number of persons who are less than 15 years of \n                age arrested for murder increased by 4 percent; and\n                    (B) the number of persons arrested for all violent \n                crimes increased by 1.3 percent, but the number of \n                persons who are less than 15 years of age arrested for \n                violent crimes increased by 9.2 percent, and the number \n                of persons less than 18 years of age arrested for such \n                crimes increased by 6.5 percent;\n            (4) from 1985 to 1996, the number of persons arrested for \n        all violent crimes increased by 52.3 percent, but the number of \n        persons under age 18 arrested for violent crimes rose by 75 \n        percent;\n            (5) the number of juvenile offenders is expected to undergo \n        a massive increase during the first 2 decades of the twenty-\n        first century, culminating in an unprecedented number of \n        violent offenders who are less than 18 years of age;\n            (6) the rehabilitative model of sentencing for juveniles, \n        which Congress rejected for adult offenders when Congress \n        enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, is inadequate and \n        inappropriate for dealing with many violent and repeat juvenile \n        offenders;\n            (7) the Federal Government should encourage the States to \n        experiment with progressive solutions to the escalating problem \n        of juveniles who commit violent crimes and who are repeat \n        offenders, including prosecuting such offenders as adults, but \n        should not impose specific strategies or programs on the \n        States;\n            (8) an effective strategy for reducing violent juvenile \n        crime requires greater collection of investigative data and \n        other information, such as fingerprints and DNA evidence, as \n        well as greater sharing of such information--\n                    (A) among Federal, State, and local agencies, \n                including the courts; and\n                    (B) among the law enforcement, educational, and \n                social service systems;\n            (9) data regarding violent juvenile offenders should be \n        made available to the adult criminal justice system if \n        recidivism by criminals is to be addressed adequately;\n            (10) holding juvenile proceedings in secret denies victims \n        of crime the opportunity to attend and be heard at such \n        proceedings, helps juvenile offenders to avoid accountability \n        for their actions, and shields juvenile proceedings from public \n        scrutiny and accountability;\n            (11) the injuries and losses suffered by the victims of \n        violent crime are no less painful or devastating because the \n        offender is a juvenile; and\n            (12) the prevention, investigation, prosecution, \n        adjudication, and punishment of criminal offenses committed by \n        juveniles, and the rehabilitation and correction of juvenile \n        offenders are, and should remain, primarily the responsibility \n        of the States, to be carried out without interference from the \n        Federal Government.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to reform Federal juvenile justice programs and \n        policies in order to promote the emergence of juvenile justice \n        systems in which the paramount concerns are providing for the \n        safety of the public and holding juvenile wrongdoers \n        accountable for their actions, while providing the wrongdoer a \n        genuine opportunity for self-reform;\n            (2) to revise the procedures in Federal court that are \n        applicable to the prosecution of juvenile offenders; and\n            (3) to encourage and promote, consistent with the ideals of \n        federalism, adoption of policies by the States to ensure that \n        the victims of violent crimes committed by juveniles receive \n        the same level of justice as do victims of violent crimes that \n        are committed by adults.\n\nSEC. 3. SEVERABILITY.\n\n    If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this Act, or the \napplication of such provision or amendment to any person or \ncircumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, \nthe amendments made by this Act, and the application of the provisions \nof such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n                    TITLE I--JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM\n\nSEC. 101. SURRENDER TO STATE AUTHORITIES.\n\n    Section 5001 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \nstriking the first undesignated paragraph and inserting the following:\n    ``Whenever any person who is less than 18 years of age is been \narrested and charged with the commission of an offense (or an act of \ndelinquency that would be an offense were it committed by an adult) \npunishable in any court of the United States or of the District of \nColumbia, the United States Attorney for the district in which such \nperson has been arrested may forego prosecution pursuant to section \n5032(a)(2) if, after investigation by the United States Attorney, it \nappears that--\n            ``(1) such person has committed an act that is also an \n        offense or an act of delinquency under the law of any State or \n        the District of Columbia;\n            ``(2) such State or the District of Columbia, as \n        applicable, can and will assume jurisdiction over such juvenile \n        and will take such juvenile into custody and deal with the \n        juvenile in accordance with the law of such State or the \n        District of Columbia, as applicable; and\n            ``(3) it is in the best interests of the United States and \n        of the juvenile offender.''.\n\nSEC. 102.

Research shows that children exposed to \nnegative brain stimulation in the form of physical and sexual abuse and \nviolence in the family or community causes the brain to be miswired \nmaking it difficult for the child to be successful in life. \nIntervention early in a child's life to correct the miswiring is much \nmore successful than adult rehabilitation efforts.\n    (b) In General.--The Secretary shall award grants, enter into \ncontracts or cooperative agreements to public and nonprofit private \nentities, as well as to Indian tribes, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska \nNative nonprofit corporations to establish national and regional \ncenters of excellence on psychological trauma response and to identify \nthe best practices for treating psychiatric and behavioral disorders \nresulting from children witnessing or experiencing such stress.\n    (c) Priorities.--In awarding grants, contracts or cooperative \nagreements under subsection (a) related to the identifying best \npractices for treating disorders associated with psychological trauma, \nthe Secretary shall give priority to programs that work with children, \nadolescents, adults, and families who are survivors and witnesses of \nchild abuse, domestic, school, and community violence, and disasters.\n    (d) Geographical Distribution.--The Secretary shall ensure that \ngrants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under subsection (a) with \nrespect to centers of excellence are distributed equitably among the \nregions of the country and among urban and rural areas.\n    (e) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall require that each applicant \nfor a grant, contract or cooperative agreement under subsection (a) \nsubmit a plan as part of his application for the rigorous evaluation of \nthe activities funded under the grant, contract or agreement, including \nboth process and outcomes evaluation, and the submission of an \nevaluation at the end of the project period.\n    (f) Duration of Awards.--With respect to a grant, contract or \ncooperative agreement under this section, the period during which \npayments under such an award will be made to the recipient may not be \nless than 3 years. Such grants, contract or agreement may be renewed.\n    (g) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthis section, the General Accounting Office shall prepare and submit to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate \nand the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives a report \nconcerning whether individuals are covered for post-traumatic stress \ndisorders under public and private health plans, and the course of \ntreatment, if any, that is covered.\n    (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be \nappropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this section for \nfiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n\n     TITLE IV--VOLUNTARY MEDIA AGREEMENTS FOR CHILDREN'S PROTECTION\n\n                   Subtitle A--Children and the Media\n\nSEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Children's Protection Act of \n1999''.\n\nSEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n        States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n        lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n        televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n        American home 7 hours every day.\n            (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n        lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n        that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend an \n        average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n            (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n        perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n        behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n            (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n        and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n        children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n        correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n        violence and a number of behavioral and psychological problems.\n            (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n        children who are consistently exposed to violence on television \n        have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and aggressive \n        behavior, both as children and later in life.\n            (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n        violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n        and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n        fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n            (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n        that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n        influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. This \n        research suggests that heavy exposure to programming with \n        strong sexual content contributes to the early commencement of \n        sexual activity among teenagers.\n            (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n        (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of conduct \n        that was based on an understanding of the influence exerted by \n        television and on a widely held sense of responsibility for \n        using that influence carefully.\n            (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n        National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense of \n        responsibility as follows:\n                    (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, \n                great care must be exercised to be sure that the \n                treatment and presentation are made in good faith and \n                not for the purpose of sensationalism or to shock or \n                exploit the audience or appeal to prurient interests or \n                morbid curiosity.''.\n                    (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility \n                toward children. Programs designed primarily for \n                children should take into account the range of \n                interests and needs of children, from instructional and \n                cultural material to a wide variety of entertainment \n                material. In their totality, programs should contribute \n                to the sound, balanced development of children to help \n                them achieve a sense of the world at large and informed \n                adjustments to their society.''.\n                    (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may \n                only be projected in responsibly handled contexts, not \n                used exploitatively. Programs involving violence \n                present the consequences of it to its victims and \n                perpetrators. Presentation of the details of violence \n                should avoid the excessive, the gratuitous and the \n                instructional.''.\n                    (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and \n                similarly important human relationships, and material \n                with sexual connotations, shall not be treated \n                exploitatively or irresponsibly, but with \n                sensitivity.''.\n                    (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n                broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in \n                which many of their programs are viewed. There shall be \n                no graphic portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. \n                The portrayal of implied sexual acts must be essential \n                to the plot and presented in a responsible and tasteful \n                manner.''.\n            (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n        code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n        restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n        Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n        district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n        Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions on \n        those grounds. However, none of the programming standards of \n        the code were challenged.\n            (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n        programming standards were never found to have violated any \n        antitrust law.\n            (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n        abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n        broadcast and cable television have deteriorated dramatically.\n            (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n        public concern about the impact of television on children, and \n        on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls routinely \n        show that more than 80 percent of Americans are worried by the \n        increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, and vulgarity on \n        television and by the amount of programming that openly \n        sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and degrading \n        behavior.\n            (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n        taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n        programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n        industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary guidelines \n        designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive portrayals of \n        violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the broadcast and cable \n        television industries agreed to conduct independent studies of \n        the violent content in their programming and make those reports \n        public.\n            (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n        commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n        programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for children. \n        That system was implemented at the beginning of 1999.\n            (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n        about the impact of television on children, millions of \n        Americans, especially parents with young children, remain angry \n        and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n        programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n        and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n        the children and the values of the United States.\n            (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n        indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n        to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines would \n        not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that ``such \n        activities may be likened to traditional standard setting \n        efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition and may \n        have significant procompetitive benefits . . . . Such \n        guidelines could serve to disseminate valuable information on \n        program content to both advertisers and television viewers. \n        Accurate information can enhance the demand for, and increase \n        the output of, an industry's products or services.''.\n            (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n        437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n        have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n        informational needs of children.\n            (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n        the television broadcasters in the United States have not \n        fulfilled their obligations under the Children's Television Act \n        of 1990 and have not noticeably expanded the amount of \n        educational and informational programming directed at young \n        viewers since the enactment of that Act.\n            (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n        games is growing steadily among children. Although most popular \n        video and personal computer games are educational or harmless \n        in nature, many of the most popular are extremely violent. One \n        recent study by Strategic Record Research found that 64 percent \n        of teenagers played video or personal computer games on a \n        regular basis. Other surveys of children as young as elementary \n        school age found that almost half of them list violent computer \n        games among their favorites.\n            (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n        glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n        shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n        advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n        selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n            (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n        games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n        impressionable children.\n            (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n        of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n        music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n        American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th grades \n        the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock or rap \n        music, just slightly less than the entire number of hours spent \n        in the classroom from kindergarten through high school.\n            (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n        are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n        appear to glamorize violence.\n            (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n        attitudes, and emotional state. The use of music as therapy \n        indicates its potential to increase emotional, psychological. \n        and physical health. That influence can be used for ill as \n        well.\n\nSEC. 403.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This subtitle may be referred to as the ``Criminal Use of Firearms \nby Felons (CUFF) Act''.\n\nSEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Tragedies such as those occurring recently in the \n        communities of Pearl, Mississippi, Paducah, Kentucky, \n        Jonesboro, Arkansas, Springfield, Oregon, and Littleton, \n        Colorado are terrible reminders of the vulnerability of \n        innocent individuals to random and senseless acts of criminal \n        violence.\n            (2) The United States Congress has responded to the problem \n        of gun violence by passing numerous criminal statutes and by \n        supporting the development of law enforcement programs designed \n        both to punish the criminal misuse of weapons and also to deter \n        individuals from undertaking illegal acts.\n            (3) In 1988, the Administration initiated an innovative \n        program known as Project Achilles. The concept behind the \n        initiative was that the illegal possession of firearms was the \n        Achilles heel or the area of greatest vulnerability of \n        criminals. By aggressively prosecuting criminals with guns in \n        Federal court, the offenders were subject to stiffer penalties \n        and expedited prosecutions. The Achilles program was \n        particularly effective in removing the most violent criminals \n        from our communities.\n            (4) In 1991, the Administration expanded its efforts to \n        remove criminals with guns from our streets with Project \n        Triggerlock. Triggerlock continued the ideas formulated in the \n        Achilles program and committed the Department of Justice \n        resources to the prosecution effort. Under the program, every \n        United States Attorney was directed to form special teams of \n        Federal, State, and local investigators to look for gang and \n        drug cases that could be prosecuted as Federal weapon \n        violations. Congress appropriated additional funds to allow a \n        large number of new law enforcement officers and Federal \n        prosecutors to target these gun and drug offenders. In 1992, \n        approximately 7048 defendants were prosecuted under this \n        initiative.\n            (5) Since 1993, the number of ``Project Triggerlock'' type \n        gun prosecutions pursued by the Department of Justice has \n        fallen to approximately 3807 prosecutions in 1998. This is a \n        decline of over 40 percent in Federal prosecutions of criminals \n        with guns.\n            (6) The threat of criminal prosecution in the Federal \n        criminal justice system works to deter criminal behavior \n        because the Federal system is known for speedier trials and \n        longer prison sentences.\n            (7) The deterrent effect of Federal gun prosecutions has \n        been demonstrated recently by successful programs, such as \n        ``Project Exile'' in Richmond, Virginia, which resulted in a 22 \n        percent decrease in violent crime since 1994.\n            (8) The Department of Justice's failure to prosecute the \n        criminal use of guns under existing Federal law undermines the \n        significant deterrent effect that these laws are meant to \n        produce.\n            (9) The Department of Justice already possesses a vast \n        array of Federal criminal statutes that, if used aggressively \n        to prosecute wrongdoers, would significantly reduce both the \n        threat of, and the incidence of, criminal gun violence.\n            (10) As an example, the Department of Justice has the \n        statutory authority in section 922(q) of title 18, United \n        States Code, to prosecute individuals who bring guns to school \n        zones. Although the Administration stated that over 6,000 \n        students were expelled last year for bringing guns to school, \n        the Justice Department reports prosecuting only 8 cases under \n        section 922(q) in 1998.\n            (11) The Department of Justice is also empowered under \n        section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code, to prosecute \n        adults who transfer handguns to juveniles. In 1998, the \n        Department of Justice reports having prosecuted only 6 \n        individuals under this provision.\n            (12) The Department of Justice's utilization of existing \n        prosecutorial power is 1 of the most significant steps that can \n        be taken to reduce the number of criminal acts involving guns, \n        and represents a better response to the problem of criminal \n        violence than the enactment of new, symbolic laws, which, if \n        current Departmental trends hold, would likely be \n        underutilized.\n\nSEC. 803.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This title may be cited as the ``Violence Prevention Training for \nEarly Childhood Educators Act''.\n\nSEC. 1302. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this title is to provide grants to institutions that \ncarry out early childhood education training programs to enable the \ninstitutions to include violence prevention training as part of the \npreparation of individuals pursuing careers in early childhood \ndevelopment and education.\n\nSEC. 1303. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single \n        best predictor of aggression in later life.\n            (2) Aggressive and defiant behavior predictive of later \n        delinquency is increasing among our Nation's youngest children. \n        Without prevention efforts, higher percentages of juveniles are \n        likely to become violent juvenile offenders.\n            (3) Research has demonstrated that aggression is primarily \n        a learned behavior that develops through observation, \n        imitation, and direct experience. Therefore, children who \n        experience violence as victims or as witnesses are at increased \n        risk of becoming violent themselves.\n            (4) In a study at a Boston city hospital, 1 out of every 10 \n        children seen in the primary care clinic had witnessed a \n        shooting or a stabbing before the age of 6, with 50 percent of \n        the children witnessing in the home and 50 percent of the \n        children witnessing in the streets.\n            (5) A study in New York found that children who had been \n        victims of violence within their families were 24 percent more \n        likely to report violent behavior as adolescents, and \n        adolescents who had grown up in families where partner violence \n        occurred were 21 percent more likely to report violent \n        delinquency than individuals not exposed to violence.\n            (6) Aggression can become well-learned and difficult to \n        change by the time a child reaches adolescence. Early childhood \n        offers a critical period for overcoming risk for violent \n        behavior and providing support for prosocial behavior.\n            (7) Violence prevention programs for very young children \n        yield economic benefits. By providing health and stability to \n        the individual child and the child's family, the programs may \n        reduce expenditures for medical care, special education, and \n        involvement with the judicial system.\n            (8) Primary prevention can be effective. When preschool \n        teachers teach young children interpersonal problem-solving \n        skills and other forms of conflict resolution, children are \n        less likely to demonstrate problem behaviors.\n            (9) There is evidence that family support programs in \n        families with children from birth through 5 years of age are \n        effective in preventing delinquency.\n\nSEC. 1304.

LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL ALCOHOL PROHIBITIONS THAT REDUCE \n              JUVENILE CRIME IN REMOTE ALASKA VILLAGES.\n\n    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Villages in remote areas of Alaska lack local law \n        enforcement due to the absence of a tax base to support such \n        services and to small populations that do not secure sufficient \n        funds under existing State and Federal grant program formulas.\n            (2) State troopers are often unable to respond to reports \n        of violence in remote villages if there is inclement weather, \n        and often only respond in reported felony cases.\n            (3) Studies conclude that alcohol consumption is strongly \n        linked to the commission of violent crimes in remote Alaska \n        villages and that youth are particularly susceptible to \n        developing chronic criminal behaviors associated with alcohol \n        in the absence of early intervention.\n            (4) Many remote villages have sought to limit the \n        introduction of alcohol into their communities as a means of \n        early intervention and to reduce criminal conduct among \n        juveniles.\n            (5) In many remote villages, there is no person with the \n        authority to enforce these local alcohol restrictions in a \n        manner consistent with judicical standards of due process \n        required under the State and Federal constitutions.\n            (6) Remote Alaska villages are experiencing a marked \n        increase in births and the number of juveniles residing in \n        villages is expected to increase dramatically in the next 5 \n        years.\n            (7) Adoption of alcohol prohibitions by voters in remote \n        villages represents a community-based effort to reduce juvenile \n        crime, but this local policy choice requires local law \n        enforcement to be effective.\n    (b) Grant of Federal Funds.--(1) The Attorney General is authorized \nto provide to the State of Alaska funds for State law enforcement, \njudicial infrastructure and other costs necessary in remote villages to \nimplement the prohibitions on the sale, importation and possession of \nalcohol adopted pursuant to State local option statutes.\n    (2) Funds provided to the State of Alaska under this section shall \nbe in addition to and shall not disqualify the State, local \ngovernments, or Indian tribes (as that term is defined in section 4(e) \nof the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-\n638, as amended; 25 U.S.C. 450b(e) (1998)) from Federal funds available \nunder other authority.\n    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n        carry out this section--\n                    (A) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n                    (B) $17,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n                    (C) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n            (2) Source of sums.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n        under this subsection may be derived from the Violent Crime \n        Reduction Trust Fund.\n\nSEC. 1629. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n    Nothing in this Act may be construed to create, expand or diminish \nor in any way affect the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe in the State \nof Alaska.\n\nSEC. 1630. BOUNTY HUNTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY ASSISTANCE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) bounty hunters, also known as bail enforcement officers \n        or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers and the \n        courts with valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from \n        justice;\n            (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n        and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n        discerning the difference between law enforcement officers and \n        bounty hunters;\n            (3) the availability of bail as an alternative to the \n        pretrial detention or unsecured release of criminal defendants \n        is important to the effective functioning of the criminal \n        justice system;\n            (4) the safe and timely return to custody of fugitives who \n        violate bail contracts is an important matter of public safety, \n        as is the return of any other fugitive from justice;\n            (5) bail bond agents are widely regulated by the States, \n        whereas bounty hunters are largely unregulated;\n            (6) the public safety requires the employment of qualified, \n        well-trained bounty hunters; and\n            (7) in the course of their duties, bounty hunters often \n        move in and affect interstate commerce.\n    (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n            (1) the term ``bail bond agent'' means any retail seller of \n        a bond to secure the release of a criminal defendant pending \n        judicial proceedings, unless such person also is self-employed \n        to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from justice who has \n        been released on bail;\n            (2) the term ``bounty hunter''--\n                    (A) means any person whose services are engaged, \n                either as an independent contractor or as an employee \n                of a bounty hunter employer, to obtain the recovery of \n                any fugitive from justice who has been released on \n                bail; and\n                    (B) does not include any--\n                            (i) law enforcement officer acting under \n                        color of law;\n                            (ii) attorney, accountant, or other \n                        professional licensed under applicable State \n                        law;\n                            (iii) employee whose duties are primarily \n                        internal audit or credit functions;\n                            (iv) person while engaged in the \n                        performance of official duties as a member of \n                        the Armed Forces on active duty (as defined in \n                        section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States \n                        Code); or\n                            (v) bail bond agent;\n            (3) the term ``bounty hunter employer''--\n                    (A) means any person that--\n                            (i) employs 1 or more bounty hunters; or\n                            (ii) provides, as an independent \n                        contractor, for consideration, the services of \n                        1 or more bounty hunters (which may include the \n                        services of that person); and\n                    (B) does not include any bail bond agent; and\n            (4) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means a public \n        officer or employee authorized under applicable Federal or \n        State law to conduct or engage in the prevention, \n        investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of criminal \n        offenses, including any public officer or employee engaged in \n        corrections, parole, or probation functions, or the recovery of \n        any fugitive from justice.\n    (c) Model Guidelines.--\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall develop model \n        guidelines for the State control and regulation of persons \n        employed or applying for employment as bounty hunters. In \n        developing such guidelines, the Attorney General shall consult \n        with organizations representing--\n                    (A) State and local law enforcement officers;\n                    (B) State and local prosecutors;\n                    (C) the criminal defense bar;\n                    (D) bail bond agents;\n                    (E) bounty hunters; and\n                    (F) corporate sureties.\n            (2) Recommendations.--The guidelines developed under \n        paragraph (1) shall include recommendations of the Attorney \n        General regarding whether--\n                    (A) a person seeking employment as a bounty hunter \n                should--\n                            (i) be required to submit to a fingerprint-\n                        based criminal background check prior to \n                        entering into the performance of duties \n                        pursuant to employment as a bounty hunter; or\n                            (ii) not be allowed to obtain such \n                        employment if that person has been convicted of \n                        a felony offense under Federal or State law;\n                    (B) bounty hunters and bounty hunter employers \n                should be required to obtain adequate liability \n                insurance for actions taken in the course of performing \n                duties pursuant to employment as a bounty hunter; and\n                    (C) State laws should provide--\n                            (i) for the prohibition on bounty hunters \n                        entering any private dwelling, unless the \n                        bounty hunter first knocks on the front door \n                        and announces the presence of 1 or more bounty \n                        hunters; and\n                            (ii) the official recognition of bounty \n                        hunters from other States.\n            (3) Effect on bail.--The guidelines published under \n        paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of the estimated \n        effect, if any, of the adoption of the guidelines by the States \n        on--\n                    (A) the cost and availability of bail; and\n                    (B) the bail bond agent industry.\n            (4) No regulatory authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n        may be construed to authorize the promulgation of any Federal \n        regulation relating to bounty hunters, bounty hunter employers, \n        or bail bond agents.\n            (5) Publication of guidelines.--The Attorney General shall \n        publish model guidelines developed pursuant to paragraph (1) in \n        the Federal Register.\n\nSEC. 1631.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n            (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n        children begin school ready to learn.\n            (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n        activity of brain cells actually changes the physical structure \n        of the brain itself and that without a stimulating environment, \n        a baby's brain will suffer. At birth, a baby's brain contains \n        100,000,000,000 neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there \n        are stars in the Milky Way, but the wiring pattern between \n        these neurons develops over time. Children who play very little \n        or are rarely touched develop brains that are 20 to 30 percent \n        smaller than normal for their age.\n            (3) This scientific research also conclusively demonstrates \n        that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n        intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits for \n        children, families, and the Nation.\n            (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n        under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, society must \n        change to provide new supports so young children receive the \n        attention and care that they need.\n            (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n        United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n            (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n        United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n        proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller proportion \n        of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n            (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n        between--\n                    (A) lack of early intervention for children; and\n                    (B) increased violence and crime among youth.\n            (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n        over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n        delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n        crisis situations that frequently could have been avoided or \n        made much less severe through good early intervention for \n        children.\n            (9) Many local communities across the country have \n        developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n        additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities for \n        young children.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Federal \nfunding for early childhood development collaboratives should be a \npriority in the Federal budget for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent \nfiscal years.\n\nSEC. 1633. PROHIBITION ON PROMOTING VIOLENCE ON FEDERAL PROPERTY.\n\n    (a) General Rule.--A Federal department or agency that--\n            (1) considers a request from an individual or entity for \n        the use of any property, facility, equipment, or personnel of \n        the department or agency, or for any other cooperation from the \n        department or agency, to film a motion picture or television \n        production for commercial purposes; and\n            (2) makes a determination as to whether granting a request \n        described in paragraph (1) is consistent with--\n                    (A) United States policy;\n                    (B) the mission or interest of the department or \n                agency; or\n                    (C) the public interest;\nshall not grant such a request without considering whether such motion \npicture or television production glorifies or endorses wanton and \ngratuitous violence.\n    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to--\n            (1) any bona fide newsreel or news television production; \n        or\n            (2) any public service announcement.\n\nSEC. 1634. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PAWN SHOPS AND SPECIAL LICENSEES.\n\n    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the repeal \nheretofore effected by paragraph (1) and the amendment heretofore \neffected by paragraph (2) of subsection (c) with the heading \n``Provision Related to Pawn and Other Transactions'' of section 503 of \ntitle V with the heading ``General Firearm Provisions'' shall be null \nand void.\n    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, section \n923(m)(1), of title 18, United States Code, as heretofore provided, is \namended by adding at the end the following subparagraph:\n                    ``(F) Compliance.--Except as to the State and local \n                planning and zoning requirements for a licensed \n                premises as provided in subparagraph (D), a special \n                licensee shall be subject to all of the provisions of \n                this chapter applicable to dealers, including, but not \n                limited to, the performance of an instant background \n                check.''.\n\nSEC. 1635. EXTENSION OF BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO GUN SHOWS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually \n        across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees per \n        show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed \n        firearms sellers;\n            (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n        other organized events, at which a large number of firearms are \n        offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed \n        firearms sellers, form a significant part of the national \n        firearms market;\n            (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n        for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n        organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n        interstate commerce;\n            (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n        for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n        organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, and \n        the raw materials from which it is manufactured have moved in \n        interstate commerce;\n            (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n        which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n        provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n        which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n        without background checks and without records that enable gun \n        tracing;\n            (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n        at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n        criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without \n        background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be traced \n        to later commit crimes;\n            (7) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n        flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n        attend these events and engage in the interstate transportation \n        of firearms obtained at these events;\n            (8) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n        exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n        markets, and other organized events;\n            (9) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n        transferred illegally to residents of another State by Federal \n        firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, and have \n        been involved in subsequent crimes including drug offenses, \n        crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal possession of \n        firearms by felons and other prohibited persons; and\n            (10) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n        clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n        States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals and \n        other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun shows, \n        flea markets, and other organized events.\n    (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, \nis amended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(35) Gun show.--The term `gun show' means any event--\n            ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited \n        for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more of the firearms \n        has been shipped or transported in, or otherwise affects, \n        interstate or foreign commerce; and\n            ``(B) at which--\n                    ``(i) not less than 20 percent of the exhibitors \n                are firearm exhibitors;\n                    ``(ii) there are not less than 10 firearm \n                exhibitors; or\n                    ``(iii) 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, \n                transfer, or exchange.\n    ``(36) Gun show promoter.--The term `gun show promoter' means any \nperson who organizes, plans, promotes, or operates a gun show.\n    ``(37) Gun show vendor.--The term `gun show vendor' means any \nperson who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, or exchanges 1 \nor more firearms at a gun show, regardless of whether or not the person \narranges with the gun show promoter for a fixed location from which to \nexhibit, sell, offer for sale, transfer, or exchange 1 or more \nfirearms.''\n    (c) Regulation of Firearms Transfers at Gun Shows.--\n            (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 931.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n        facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, \n        body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n            (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n        interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n            (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n        affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n        over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n        control this traffic within their own borders through the \n        exercise of their police power;\n            (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n        Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of \n        body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n        California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n        outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to \n        community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor during \n        the commission of a violent crime;\n            (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n        of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved \n        by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times \n        higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n            (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n        of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n            (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n        police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n        needed by Federal agencies; and\n            (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n        clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n        States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n        that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\nSEC. 1643.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Citizens have an individual right, under the Second \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear \n        arms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearms Owners \n        Protection Act of 1986 specifically state that it is not the \n        intent of Congress to frustrate the free exercise of that right \n        in enacting Federal legislation. The free exercise of that \n        right includes law abiding firearms owners buying, selling, \n        trading, and collecting guns in accordance with Federal, State, \n        and local laws for whatever lawful use they deem desirable.\n            (2) The Internet is a powerful information medium, which \n        has and continues to be an excellent tool to educate citizens \n        on the training, education and safety programs available to use \n        firearms safely and responsibly. It has, and should continue to \n        develop, as a 21st century tool for ``e-commerce'' and \n        marketing many products, including firearms and sporting goods. \n        Many web sites related to these topics are sponsored in large \n        part by the sporting firearms and hunting community.\n            (3) It is the intent of Congress that this legislation be \n        applied where the Internet is being exploited to violate the \n        applicable explosives and firearms laws of the United States.\n\nSEC. 1663. PROHIBITIONS ON USES OF THE INTERNET.\n\n    (a) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n``Sec. 931.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) violent juvenile crime rates have been increasing in \n        United States schools, causing many high-profile deaths of \n        young, innocent school children;\n            (2) in 1994, there were 2,700,000 arrests of persons under \n        age 18 (a third of whom were under age 15), up from 1,700,000 \n        in 1991;\n            (3) while crime is generally down in many urban and \n        suburban areas, crime committed by teenagers has spiked sharply \n        over the past few years;\n            (4) there is no single solution, or panacea, to the problem \n        of rising juvenile crime;\n            (5) there will soon be over 34,000,000 teenagers in the \n        United States, which is 26 percent higher than the number of \n        such teenagers in 1990 and the largest number of teenagers in \n        the United States to date;\n            (6) in order to ensure the safety of youth in the United \n        States, the Nation should begin to explore innovative methods \n        of curbing the rise in violent crime in United States schools, \n        such as use of faith-based and grassroots initiatives; and\n            (7)(A) a strong partnership among law enforcement, local \n        government, juvenile and family courts, schools, businesses, \n        charitable organizations, families, and the religious community \n        can create a community environment that supports the youth of \n        the Nation and reduces the occurrence of juvenile crime; and\n            (B) the development of character and strong moral values \n        will--\n                    (i) greatly decrease the likelihood that youth will \n                fall victim to the temptations of crime; and\n                    (ii) improve the lives and future prospects of \n                high-risk youth and their communities.\n\nSEC. 1673.

The survey found that passage of \n        the new health care law prompted health insurance carriers to \n        stop selling new child-only health plans in many States.\n            (2) Of the 50 States, 17 States reported that there are no \n        health insurance carriers selling child-only health plans to \n        new enrollees in the State.\n            (3) Thirty-nine States indicated that at least one health \n        insurance carrier exited the child-only health insurance market \n        in the State following enactment of the new health care law.\n            (4) Accordingly, child-only health insurance access and \n        competition in the market have declined significantly since the \n        passage of the new health care law. This precedent raises \n        concerns about the impact that similar changes, which are \n        scheduled to go into effect in 2014, will have in reducing \n        access and competition in the health insurance market.\n            (5) Americans under the age of 19 should be able to get \n        health insurance coverage in every State, and if it is not \n        offered in their State, they should be able to purchase health \n        insurance coverage from another State.\n\nSEC. 3. PURCHASING CHILD-ONLY HEALTH INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES.\n\n    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \neffective on 01/10/2011, a health insurance issuer that is \nlicensed to offer child-only health insurance coverage in a State may \nalso offer such coverage to eligible residents of other States. The \nlaws of the State in which the issuer is licensed shall apply with \nrespect to any such coverage.\n    (b) Open Enrollment.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nprovide for the application of a uniform annual enrollment period of at \nleast 45 days with respect to child-only health insurance coverage to \nwhich this section applies.\n    (c) Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \npromulgate regulations to carry out this section, including regulations \nthat--\n            (1) provide protections to enrollees under such \n        regulations;\n            (2) ensure the solvency of health insurance issuers that \n        offer coverage under such regulations; and\n            (3) clarify the procedures that would apply when an \n        enrollee has a complaint concerning their coverage.\n    (d) Definitions.--\n            (1) In general.--The definitions contained in section 2791 \n        of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-91) shall \n        apply for purposes of this section.\n            (2) Child-only health insurance coverage.--The term \n        ``child-only health insurance coverage'' means health insurance \n        coverage that is offered only to individuals who are under 19 \n        years of age.\n                                 <all>\n\n\n\n\n",

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Compassionate Assistance for Rape \nEmergencies Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become \n        pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest. Timely access \n        to emergency contraception could help many of these rape \n        survivors avoid the additional trauma of facing an unintended \n        pregnancy.\n            (2) A 1996 study of rape-related pregnancies (published in \n        the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology) found that \n        50 percent of the pregnancies described in paragraph (1) ended \n        in abortion.\n            (3) Surveys have shown that many hospitals do not routinely \n        provide emergency contraception to women seeking treatment \n        after being sexually assaulted.\n            (4) The risk of pregnancy after sexual assault has been \n        estimated to be 4.7 percent in survivors who were not protected \n        by some form of contraception at the time of the attack.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency \n        contraception to be safe and effective in preventing unintended \n        pregnancy if taken in the first 72 hours of sex.\n            (6) Medical research strongly indicates that the sooner \n        emergency contraception is administered, the greater the \n        likelihood of preventing unintended pregnancy.\n            (7) In light of the safety and effectiveness of emergency \n        contraceptive pills, both the American Medical Association and \n        the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have \n        endorsed more widespread availability of such pills to women of \n        all ages.\n            (8) The American College of Emergency Physicians and the \n        American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree that \n        offering emergency contraception to female patients after a \n        sexual assault should be considered the standard of care.\n            (9) Approximately one-third of women of reproductive age \n        remain unaware of emergency contraception. Therefore, women who \n        have been sexually assaulted are unlikely to ask for emergency \n        contraception.\n            (10) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n        emergency medical treatment provide emergency contraception as \n        a treatment option to any woman who has been sexually \n        assaulted, so that she may prevent an unintended pregnancy.\n            (11) Victims of sexual assault are at increased risk of \n        contracting sexually transmitted diseases.\n            (12) Some sexually transmitted infections cannot be \n        reliably cured if treatment is delayed, and may result in high \n        morbidity and mortality. HIV has killed over 520,000 \n        individuals in the United States, and the Centers for Disease \n        Control and Prevention currently estimates that over 1,000,000 \n        individuals in the United States are infected with the virus. \n        Even modern drug treatment has failed to cure infected \n        individuals. Nearly 60,000 individuals in the United States are \n        infected with hepatitis B each year, with some individuals \n        unable to fully recover. An estimated 1,250,000 individuals in \n        the United States remain chronically infected with the \n        hepatitis B virus and at present, 1 in 4 of those infected \n        individuals may expect to die of liver failure.\n            (13) It is possible to prevent some sexually transmitted \n        diseases by treating an exposed individual promptly. The use of \n        post-exposure prophylaxis using antiretroviral drugs has been \n        demonstrated to effectively prevent the establishment of HIV \n        infection. Hepatitis B infection may also be eliminated if an \n        exposed individual receives prompt treatment.\n            (14) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        recommended risk evaluation and appropriate application of \n        post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault. For such \n        individuals, immediate treatment is the only means to prevent a \n        life-threatening infection.\n            (15) It is essential that all hospitals that provide \n        emergency medical treatment provide assessment and treatment of \n        sexually transmitted infections to minimize the harm to victims \n        of sexual assault.\n\nSEC. 3.
