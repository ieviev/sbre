                             BY MARK TWAIN







ETEXT EDITOR'S NOTE:

This is a compilation of all the works of Mark Twain in the Project

Gutenberg Mark Twain collection which now has over sixty files.  These

individual files have been prepared by many different Gutenberg

volunteers over a period of many years.  Any of the individual works may

be found in much smaller size than this "entire" file at:



The Gutenberg Project Search Page:   http://www.promo.net/pg/



As additional works of Mark Twain become available the present file will

be updated to include them.  The bibliography of Twain by Albert Bigelow

Paine has been used in organizing the major works in this collection in

the order of the date of their first publication; however many of the

short stories, speeches and other shorter works are not in chronologic

order as they were originally included as part of major works of much

different publishing date.

                                 PREFACE



This book is a record of a pleasure trip.  If it were a record of a

solemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, that

profundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper

to works of that kind, and withal so attractive.  Yet notwithstanding it

is only a record of a pic-nic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest to

the reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked

at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in

those countries before him.  I make small pretense of showing anyone how

he ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books do

that, and therefore, even if I were competent to do it, there is no need.



I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel-

writing that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen with

impartial eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether

wisely or not.



In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the

Daily Alta California, of San Francisco, the proprietors of that journal

having waived their rights and given me the necessary permission.  I have

also inserted portions of several letters written for the New York

Tribune and the New York Herald.



THE AUTHOR.

SAN FRANCISCO.











CHAPTER I.



For months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land was

chatted about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed at

countless firesides.  It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its like

had not been thought of before, and it compelled that interest which

attractive novelties always command.  It was to be a picnic on a gigantic

scale.  The participants in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steam

ferry--boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts, and paddling up

some obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselves

out with a long summer day's laborious frolicking under the impression

that it was fun, were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flying

and cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in

many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history! They were to

sail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean;

they were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship with shouts

and laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks,

or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and the

shark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at night

they were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of a

ballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by the

bending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the

magnificent moon--dance, and promenade, and smoke, and sing, and make

love, and search the skies for constellations that never associate with

the "Big Dipper" they were so tired of; and they were to see the ships of

twenty navies--the customs and costumes of twenty curious peoples--the

great cities of half a world--they were to hob-nob with nobility and hold

friendly converse with kings and princes, grand moguls, and the anointed

lords of mighty empires! It was a brave conception; it was the offspring

of a most ingenious brain.  It was well advertised, but it hardly needed

it: the bold originality, the extraordinary character, the seductive

nature, and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhere

and advertised it in every household in the land.  Who could read the

program of the excursion without longing to make one of the party? I will

insert it here.  It is almost as good as a map.  As a text for this book,

nothing could be better:



                   EXCURSION TO THE HOLY LAND, EGYPT,

      THE CRIMEA, GREECE, AND INTERMEDIATE POINTS OF INTEREST.

                     BROOKLYN, February 1st, 1867



       The undersigned will make an excursion as above during the coming

     season, and begs to submit to you the following programme:



       A first-class steamer, to be under his own command, and capable of

     accommodating at least one hundred and fifty cabin passengers, will

     be selected, in which will be taken a select company, numbering not

     more than   three-fourths of the ship's capacity.  There is good

     reason to believe that this company can be easily made up in this

     immediate vicinity, of mutual friends and acquaintances.



       The steamer will be provided with every necessary comfort,

     including library and musical instruments.



       An experienced physician will be on board.



       Leaving New York about June 1st, a middle and pleasant route will

     be taken across the Atlantic, and passing through the group of

     Azores, St. Michael will be reached in about ten days.  A day or two

     will be spent here, enjoying the fruit and wild scenery of these

     islands, and the voyage continued, and Gibraltar reached in three or

     four days.



       A day or two will be spent here in looking over the wonderful

     subterraneous fortifications, permission to visit these galleries

     being readily obtained.



       From Gibraltar, running along the coasts of Spain and France,

     Marseilles will be reached in three days.  Here ample time will be

     given not only to look over the city, which was founded six hundred

     years before the Christian era, and its artificial port, the finest

     of the kind in the Mediterranean, but to visit Paris during the

     Great Exhibition; and the beautiful city of Lyons, lying

     intermediate, from the heights of which, on a clear day, Mont Blanc

     and the Alps can be distinctly seen.  Passengers who may wish to

     extend the time at Paris can do so, and, passing down through

     Switzerland, rejoin the steamer at Genoa.



       From Marseilles to Genoa is a run of one night.  The excursionists

     will have an opportunity to look over this, the "magnificent city of

     palaces," and visit the birthplace of Columbus, twelve miles off,

     over a beautiful road built by Napoleon I.  From this point,

     excursions may be made to Milan, Lakes Como and Maggiore, or to

     Milan, Verona (famous for its extraordinary fortifications), Padua,

     and Venice.  Or, if passengers desire to visit Parma (famous for

     Correggio's frescoes) and Bologna, they can by rail go on to

     Florence, and rejoin the steamer at Leghorn, thus spending about

     three weeks amid the cities most famous for art in Italy.



       From Genoa the run to Leghorn will be made along the coast in one

     night, and time appropriated to this point in which to visit

     Florence, its palaces and galleries; Pisa, its cathedral and

     "Leaning Tower," and Lucca and its baths, and Roman amphitheater;

     Florence, the most remote, being distant by rail about sixty miles.



       From Leghorn to Naples (calling at Civita Vecchia to land any who

     may prefer to go to Rome from that point), the distance will be made

     in about thirty-six hours; the route will lay along the coast of

     Italy, close by Caprera, Elba, and Corsica.  Arrangements have been

     made to take on board at Leghorn a pilot for Caprera, and, if

     practicable, a call will be made there to visit the home of

     Garibaldi.



       Rome [by rail], Herculaneum, Pompeii, Vesuvius, Vergil's tomb, and

     possibly the ruins of Paestum can be visited, as well as the

     beautiful surroundings of Naples and its charming bay.



       The next point of interest will be Palermo, the most beautiful

     city of Sicily, which will be reached in one night from Naples.  A

     day will be spent here, and leaving in the evening, the course will

     be taken towards Athens.



       Skirting along the north coast of Sicily, passing through the

     group of Aeolian Isles, in sight of Stromboli and Vulcania, both

     active volcanoes, through the Straits of Messina, with "Scylla" on

     the one hand and "Charybdis" on the other, along the east coast of

     Sicily, and in sight of Mount Etna, along the south coast of Italy,

     the west and south coast of Greece, in sight of ancient Crete, up

     Athens Gulf, and into the Piraeus, Athens will be reached in two and

     a half or three days.  After tarrying here awhile, the Bay of

     Salamis will be crossed, and a day given to Corinth, whence the

     voyage will be continued to Constantinople, passing on the way

     through the Grecian Archipelago, the Dardanelles, the Sea of

     Marmora, and the mouth of the Golden Horn, and arriving in about

     forty-eight hours from Athens.



       After leaving Constantinople, the way will be taken out through

     the beautiful Bosphorus, across the Black Sea to Sebastopol and

     Balaklava, a run of about twenty-four hours.  Here it is proposed to

     remain two days, visiting the harbors, fortifications, and

     battlefields of the Crimea; thence back through the Bosphorus,

     touching at Constantinople to take in any who may have preferred to

     remain there; down through the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles,

     along the coasts of ancient Troy and Lydia in Asia, to Smyrna, which

     will be reached in two or two and a half days from Constantinople.

     A sufficient stay will be made here to give opportunity of visiting

     Ephesus, fifty miles distant by rail.



       From Smyrna towards the Holy Land the course will lay through the

     Grecian  Archipelago, close by the Isle of Patmos, along the coast

     of Asia, ancient Pamphylia, and the Isle of Cyprus.  Beirut will be

     reached in three days.  At Beirut time will be given to visit

     Damascus; after which the steamer will proceed to Joppa.



       From Joppa, Jerusalem, the River Jordan, the Sea of Tiberias,

     Nazareth, Bethany, Bethlehem, and other points of interest in the

     Holy Land can be visited, and here those who may have preferred to

     make the journey from Beirut through the country, passing through

     Damascus, Galilee, Capernaum, Samaria, and by the River Jordan and

     Sea of Tiberias, can rejoin the steamer.



       Leaving Joppa, the next point of interest to visit will be

     Alexandria, which will be reached in twenty-four hours.  The ruins

     of Caesar's Palace, Pompey's Pillar, Cleopatra's Needle, the

     Catacombs, and ruins of ancient Alexandria will be found worth the

     visit.  The journey to Cairo, one hundred and thirty miles by rail,

     can be made in a few hours, and from which can be visited the site

     of ancient Memphis, Joseph's Granaries, and the Pyramids.



       From Alexandria the route will be taken homeward, calling at

     Malta, Cagliari (in Sardinia), and Palma (in Majorca), all

     magnificent harbors, with charming scenery, and abounding in fruits.



       A day or two will be spent at each place, and leaving Parma in the

     evening, Valencia in Spain will be reached the next morning.  A few

     days will be spent in this, the finest city of Spain.



       From Valencia, the homeward course will be continued, skirting

     along the coast of Spain.  Alicant, Carthagena, Palos, and Malaga

     will be passed but a mile or two distant, and Gibraltar reached in

     about twenty-four hours.



       A stay of one day will be made here, and the voyage continued to

     Madeira, which will be reached in about three days.  Captain

     Marryatt writes: "I do not know a spot on the globe which so much

     astonishes and delights upon first arrival as Madeira." A stay of

     one or two days will be made here, which, if time permits, may be

     extended, and passing on through the islands, and probably in sight

     of the Peak of Teneriffe, a southern track will be taken, and the

     Atlantic crossed within the latitudes of the northeast trade winds,

     where mild and pleasant weather, and a smooth sea, can always be

     expected.



       A call will be made at Bermuda, which lies directly in this route

     homeward, and will be reached in about ten days from Madeira, and

     after spending a short time with our friends the Bermudians, the

     final departure will be made for home, which will be reached in

     about three days.



       Already, applications have been received from parties in Europe

     wishing to join the Excursion there.



       The ship will at all times be a home, where the excursionists, if

     sick, will be surrounded by kind friends, and have all possible

     comfort and sympathy.



       Should contagious sickness exist in any of the ports named in the

     program, such ports will be passed, and others of interest

     substituted.



       The price of passage is fixed at $1,250, currency, for each adult

     passenger.  Choice of rooms and of seats at the tables apportioned

     in the order in which passages are engaged; and no passage

     considered engaged until ten percent of the passage money is

     deposited with the treasurer.



       Passengers can remain on board of the steamer, at all ports, if

     they desire, without additional expense, and all boating at the

     expense of the ship.



       All passages must be paid for when taken, in order that the most

     perfect arrangements be made for starting at the appointed time.



       Applications for passage must be approved by the committee before

     tickets are issued, and can be made to the undersigned.



       Articles of interest or curiosity, procured by the passengers

     during the voyage, may be brought home in the steamer free of

     charge.



       Five dollars per day, in gold, it is believed, will be a fair

     calculation to make for all traveling expenses onshore and at the

     various points where passengers may wish to leave the steamer for

     days at a time.



       The trip can be extended, and the route changed, by unanimous vote

     of the passengers.

       P.S.--The very beautiful and substantial side-wheel steamship

     "Quaker City" has been chartered for the occasion, and will leave

     New York June 8th.  Letters have been issued by the government

     commending the party to courtesies abroad.



What was there lacking about that program to make it perfectly

irresistible? Nothing that any finite mind could discover.  Paris,

England, Scotland, Switzerland, Italy--Garibaldi! The Grecian

Archipelago! Vesuvius! Constantinople! Smyrna! The Holy Land! Egypt and

"our friends the Bermudians"! People in Europe desiring to join the

excursion--contagious sickness to be avoided--boating at the expense of

the ship--physician on board--the circuit of the globe to be made if the

passengers unanimously desired it--the company to be rigidly selected by

a pitiless "Committee on Applications"--the vessel to be as rigidly

selected by as pitiless a "Committee on Selecting Steamer." Human nature

could not withstand these bewildering temptations.  I hurried to the

treasurer's office and deposited my ten percent.  I rejoiced to know that

a few vacant staterooms were still left.  I did avoid a critical personal

examination into my character by that bowelless committee, but I referred

to all the people of high standing I could think of in the community who

would be least likely to know anything about me.



Shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the

Plymouth Collection of Hymns would be used on board the ship.  I then

paid the balance of my passage money.



I was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an

excursionist.  There was happiness in that but it was tame compared to

the novelty of being "select."



This supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide

themselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship, with

saddles for Syrian travel, green spectacles and umbrellas, veils for

Egypt, and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the Holy

Land.  Furthermore, it was suggested that although the ship's library

would afford a fair amount of reading matter, it would still be well if

each passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks, a Bible, and

some standard works of travel.  A list was appended, which consisted

chiefly of books relating to the Holy Land, since the Holy Land was part

of the excursion and seemed to be its main feature.



Reverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition, but

urgent duties obliged him to give up the idea.  There were other

passengers who could have been spared better and would have been spared

more willingly.  Lieutenant General Sherman was to have been of the party

also, but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains.  A popular

actress had entered her name on the ship's books, but something

interfered and she couldn't go.  The "Drummer Boy of the Potomac"

deserted, and lo, we had never a celebrity left!



However, we were to have a "battery of guns" from the Navy Department (as

per advertisement) to be used in answering royal salutes; and the

document furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, which was to make

"General Sherman and party" welcome guests in the courts and camps of the

old world, was still left to us, though both document and battery, I

think, were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions.

However, had not we the seductive program still, with its Paris, its

Constantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jericho, and "our friends the

Bermudians?" What did we care?









CHAPTER II.



Occasionally, during the following month, I dropped in at 117 Wall Street

to inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was coming

on, how additions to the passenger list were averaging, how many people

the committee were decreeing not "select" every day and banishing in

sorrow and tribulation.  I was glad to know that we were to have a little

printing press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own.  I was

glad to learn that our piano, our parlor organ, and our melodeon were to

be the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the market.  I

was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of

the gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies, several military

and naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample crop of "Professors"

of various kinds, and a gentleman who had "COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA" thundering after his name

in one awful blast!  I had carefully prepared myself to take rather a

back seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that

would alone be permitted to pass through the camel's eye of that

committee on credentials; I had schooled myself to expect an imposing

array of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat

still further back in consequence of it maybe; but I state frankly that I

was all unprepared for this crusher.



I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing.  I said

that if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must

--but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessary

to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in

better taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sections

in several ships.



Ah, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and that

his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of

seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs

for that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian

Institute, I would have felt so much relieved.



During that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for once

in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement.  Everybody

was going to Europe--I, too, was going to Europe.  Everybody was going to

the famous Paris Exposition--I, too, was going to the Paris Exposition.

The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports of

the country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate.

If I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to

Europe shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now.  I walked about

the city a good deal with a young Mr.  Blucher, who was booked for the

excursion.  He was confiding, good-natured, unsophisticated,

companionable; but he was not a man to set the river on fire.  He had the

most extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last to

consider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France.  We

stepped into a store on Broadway one day, where he bought a handkerchief,

and when the man could not make change, Mr. B. said:



"Never mind, I'll hand it to you in Paris."



"But I am not going to Paris."



"How is--what did I understand you to say?"



"I said I am not going to Paris."



"Not going to Paris!  Not g---- well, then, where in the nation are you

going to?"



"Nowhere at all."



"Not anywhere whatsoever?--not any place on earth but this?"



"Not any place at all but just this--stay here all summer."



My comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word--

walked out with an injured look upon his countenance.  Up the street

apiece he broke silence and said impressively: "It was a lie--that is my

opinion of it!"



In the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers.

I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate, and

found him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full of

generous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured.

Not any passenger that sailed in the Quaker City will withhold his

endorsement of what I have just said.  We selected a stateroom forward of

the wheel, on the starboard side, "below decks."  It bad two berths in

it, a dismal dead-light, a sink with a washbowl in it, and a long,

sumptuously cushioned locker, which was to do service as a sofa--partly--

and partly as a hiding place for our things.  Notwithstanding all this

furniture, there was still room to turn around in, but not to swing a cat

in, at least with entire security to the cat.  However, the room was

large, for a ship's stateroom, and was in every way satisfactory.



The vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in June.



A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship and

went on board.  All was bustle and confusion.  [I have seen that remark

before somewhere.]  The pier was crowded with carriages and men;

passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel's decks were

encumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in

unattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain

and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens.  The

gallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp and

disheartened by the mast.  Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest

spectacle!  It was a pleasure excursion--there was no gainsaying that,

because the program said so--it was so nominated in the bond--but it

surely hadn't the general aspect of one.



Finally, above the banging, and rumbling, and shouting, and hissing of

steam rang the order to "cast off!"--a sudden rush to the gangways--a

scampering ashore of visitors-a revolution of the wheels, and we were

off--the pic-nic was begun!  Two very mild cheers went up from the

dripping crowd on the pier; we answered them gently from the slippery

decks; the flag made an effort to wave, and failed; the "battery of guns"

spake not--the ammunition was out.



We steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor.  It was

still raining.  And not only raining, but storming.  "Outside" we could

see, ourselves, that there was a tremendous sea on.  We must lie still,

in the calm harbor, till the storm should abate.  Our passengers hailed

from fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before;

manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until

they had got their sea-legs on.  Toward evening the two steam tugs that

had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers

on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and

ancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep.  On deep five

fathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom.  And out in the solemn rain, at

that.  This was pleasuring with a vengeance.



It was an appropriate relief when the gong sounded for prayer meeting.

The first Saturday night of any other pleasure excursion might have been

devoted to whist and dancing; but I submit it to the unprejudiced mind if

it would have been in good taste for us to engage in such frivolities,

considering what we had gone through and the frame of mind we were in.

We would have shone at a wake, but not at anything more festive.



However, there is always a cheering influence about the sea; and in my

berth that night, rocked by the measured swell of the waves and lulled by

the murmur of the distant surf, I soon passed tranquilly out of all

consciousness of the dreary experiences of the day and damaging

premonitions of the future.









CHAPTER III.



All day Sunday at anchor.  The storm had gone down a great deal, but the

sea had not.  It was still piling its frothy hills high in air "outside,"

as we could plainly see with the glasses.  We could not properly begin a

pleasure excursion on Sunday; we could not offer untried stomachs to so

pitiless a sea as that.  We must lie still till Monday.  And we did.  But

we had repetitions of church and prayer-meetings; and so, of course, we

were just as eligibly situated as we could have been any where.



I was up early that Sabbath morning and was early to breakfast.  I felt a

perfectly natural desire to have a good, long, unprejudiced look at the

passengers at a time when they should be free from self-consciousness--

which is at breakfast, when such a moment occurs in the lives of human

beings at all.



I was greatly surprised to see so many elderly people--I might almost

say, so many venerable people.  A glance at the long lines of heads was

apt to make one think it was all gray.  But it was not.  There was a

tolerably fair sprinkling of young folks, and another fair sprinkling of

gentlemen and ladies who were non-committal as to age, being neither

actually old or absolutely young.



The next morning we weighed anchor and went to sea.  It was a great

happiness to get away after this dragging, dispiriting delay.  I thought

there never was such gladness in the air before, such brightness in the

sun, such beauty in the sea.  I was satisfied with the picnic then and

with all its belongings.  All my malicious instincts were dead within me;

and as America faded out of sight, I think a spirit of charity rose up in

their place that was as boundless, for the time being, as the broad ocean

that was heaving its billows about us.  I wished to express my feelings--

I wished to lift up my voice and sing; but I did not know anything to

sing, and so I was obliged to give up the idea.  It was no loss to the

ship, though, perhaps.



It was breezy and pleasant, but the sea was still very rough.  One could

not promenade without risking his neck; at one moment the bowsprit was

taking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven, and at the next it was

trying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean.  What a weird

sensation it is to feel the stem of a ship sinking swiftly from under you

and see the bow climbing high away among the clouds!  One's safest course

that day was to clasp a railing and hang on; walking was too precarious a

pastime.



By some happy fortune I was not seasick.--That was a thing to be proud

of.  I had not always escaped before.  If there is one thing in the world

that will make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited, it is to

have his stomach behave itself, the first day it sea, when nearly all his

comrades are seasick.  Soon a venerable fossil, shawled to the chin and

bandaged like a mummy, appeared at the door of the after deck-house, and

the next lurch of the ship shot him into my arms.  I said:



"Good-morning, Sir.  It is a fine day."



He put his hand on his stomach and said, "Oh, my!" and then staggered

away and fell over the coop of a skylight.



Presently another old gentleman was projected from the same door with

great violence.  I said:



"Calm yourself, Sir--There is no hurry.  It is a fine day, Sir."



He, also, put his hand on his stomach and said "Oh, my!" and reeled away.



In a little while another veteran was discharged abruptly from the same

door, clawing at the air for a saving support.  I said:



"Good morning, Sir.  It is a fine day for pleasuring.  You were about to

say--"



"Oh, my!"



I thought so.  I anticipated him, anyhow.  I stayed there and was

bombarded with old gentlemen for an hour, perhaps; and all I got out of

any of them was "Oh, my!"



I went away then in a thoughtful mood.  I said, this is a good pleasure

excursion.  I like it.  The passengers are not garrulous, but still they

are sociable.  I like those old people, but somehow they all seem to have

the "Oh, my" rather bad.



I knew what was the matter with them.  They were seasick.  And I was glad

of it.  We all like to see people seasick when we are not, ourselves.

Playing whist by the cabin lamps when it is storming outside is pleasant;

walking the quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant; smoking in the

breezy foretop is pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there; but

these are all feeble and commonplace compared with the joy of seeing

people suffering the miseries of seasickness.



I picked up a good deal of information during the afternoon.  At one time

I was climbing up the quarterdeck when the vessel's stem was in the sky;

I was smoking a cigar and feeling passably comfortable.  Somebody

ejaculated:



"Come, now, that won't answer.  Read the sign up there--NO SMOKING ABAFT

THE WHEEL!"



It was Captain Duncan, chief of the expedition.  I went forward, of

course.  I saw a long spyglass lying on a desk in one of the upper-deck

state-rooms back of the pilot-house and reached after it--there was a

ship in the distance.



"Ah, ah--hands off!  Come out of that!"



I came out of that.  I said to a deck-sweep--but in a low voice:



"Who is that overgrown pirate with the whiskers and the discordant

voice?"



"It's Captain Bursley--executive officer--sailing master."



I loitered about awhile, and then, for want of something better to do,

fell to carving a railing with my knife.  Somebody said, in an

insinuating, admonitory voice:



"Now, say--my friend--don't you know any better than to be whittling the

ship all to pieces that way? You ought to know better than that."



I went back and found the deck sweep.



"Who is that smooth-faced, animated outrage yonder in the fine clothes?"



"That's Captain L****, the owner of the ship--he's one of the main

bosses."



In the course of time I brought up on the starboard side of the

pilot-house and found a sextant lying on a bench.  Now, I said, they

"take the sun" through this thing; I should think I might see that vessel

through it.  I had hardly got it to my eye when someone touched me on the

shoulder and said deprecatingly:



"I'll have to get you to give that to me, Sir.  If there's anything you'd

like to know about taking the sun, I'd as soon tell you as not--but I

don't like to trust anybody with that instrument.  If you want any

figuring done--Aye, aye, sir!"



He was gone to answer a call from the other side.  I sought the

deck-sweep.



"Who is that spider-legged gorilla yonder with the sanctimonious

countenance?"



"It's Captain Jones, sir--the chief mate."



"Well.  This goes clear away ahead of anything I ever heard of before.

Do you--now I ask you as a man and a brother--do you think I could

venture to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting a

captain of this ship?"



"Well, sir, I don't know--I think likely you'd fetch the captain of the

watch may be, because he's a-standing right yonder in the way."



I went below--meditating and a little downhearted.  I thought, if five

cooks can spoil a broth, what may not five captains do with a pleasure

excursion.









CHAPTER IV.



We plowed along bravely for a week or more, and without any conflict of

jurisdiction among the captains worth mentioning.  The passengers soon

learned to accommodate themselves to their new circumstances, and life in

the ship became nearly as systematically monotonous as the routine of a

barrack.  I do not mean that it was dull, for it was not entirely so by

any means--but there was a good deal of sameness about it.  As is always

the fashion at sea, the passengers shortly began to pick up sailor terms

--a sign that they were beginning to feel at home.  Half-past six was no

longer half-past six to these pilgrims from New England, the South, and

the Mississippi Valley, it was "seven bells"; eight, twelve, and four

o'clock were "eight bells"; the captain did not take the longitude at

nine o'clock, but at "two bells."  They spoke glibly of the "after

cabin," the "for'rard cabin," "port and starboard" and the "fo'castle."



At seven bells the first gong rang; at eight there was breakfast, for

such as were not too seasick to eat it.  After that all the well people

walked arm-in-arm up and down the long promenade deck, enjoying the fine

summer mornings, and the seasick ones crawled out and propped themselves

up in the lee of the paddle-boxes and ate their dismal tea and toast, and

looked wretched.  From eleven o'clock until luncheon, and from luncheon

until dinner at six in the evening, the employments and amusements were

various.  Some reading was done, and much smoking and sewing, though not

by the same parties; there were the monsters of the deep to be looked

after and wondered at; strange ships had to be scrutinized through

opera-glasses, and sage decisions arrived at concerning them; and more

than that, everybody took a personal interest in seeing that the flag was

run up and politely dipped three times in response to the salutes of

those strangers; in the smoking room there were always parties of

gentlemen playing euchre, draughts and dominoes, especially dominoes,

that delightfully harmless game; and down on the main deck, "for'rard"--

for'rard of the chicken-coops and the cattle--we had what was called

"horse billiards."  Horse billiards is a fine game.  It affords good,

active exercise, hilarity, and consuming excitement.  It is a mixture of

"hop-scotch" and shuffleboard played with a crutch.  A large hop-scotch

diagram is marked out on the deck with chalk, and each compartment

numbered.  You stand off three or four steps, with some broad wooden

disks before you on the deck, and these you send forward with a vigorous

thrust of a long crutch.  If a disk stops on a chalk line, it does not

count anything.  If it stops in division No. 7, it counts 7; in 5, it

counts 5, and so on.  The game is 100, and four can play at a time.  That

game would be very simple played on a stationary floor, but with us, to

play it well required science.  We had to allow for the reeling of the

ship to the right or the left.  Very often one made calculations for a

heel to the right and the ship did not go that way.  The consequence was

that that disk missed the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two, and then

there was humiliation on one side and laughter on the other.



When it rained the passengers had to stay in the house, of course--or at

least the cabins--and amuse themselves with games, reading, looking out

of the windows at the very familiar billows, and talking gossip.



By 7 o'clock in the evening, dinner was about over; an hour's promenade

on the upper deck followed; then the gong sounded and a large majority of

the party repaired to the after cabin (upper), a handsome saloon fifty or

sixty feet long, for prayers.  The unregenerated called this saloon the

"Synagogue."  The devotions consisted only of two hymns from the Plymouth

Collection and a short prayer, and seldom occupied more than fifteen

minutes.  The hymns were accompanied by parlor-organ music when the sea

was smooth enough to allow a performer to sit at the instrument without

being lashed to his chair.



After prayers the Synagogue shortly took the semblance of a writing

school.  The like of that picture was never seen in a ship before.

Behind the long dining tables on either side of the saloon, and scattered

from one end to the other of the latter, some twenty or thirty gentlemen

and ladies sat them down under the swaying lamps and for two or three

hours wrote diligently in their journals.  Alas!  that journals so

voluminously begun should come to so lame and impotent a conclusion as

most of them did!  I doubt if there is a single pilgrim of all that host

but can show a hundred fair pages of journal concerning the first twenty

days' voyaging in the Quaker City, and I am morally certain that not ten

of the party can show twenty pages of journal for the succeeding twenty

thousand miles of voyaging!  At certain periods it becomes the dearest

ambition of a man to keep a faithful record of his performances in a

book; and he dashes at this work with an enthusiasm that imposes on him

the notion that keeping a journal is the veriest pastime in the world,

and the pleasantest.  But if he only lives twenty-one days, he will find

out that only those rare natures that are made up of pluck, endurance,

devotion to duty for duty's sake, and invincible determination may hope

to venture upon so tremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journal

and not sustain a shameful defeat.



One of our favorite youths, Jack, a splendid young fellow with a head

full of good sense, and a pair of legs that were a wonder to look upon in

the way of length and straightness and slimness, used to report progress

every morning in the most glowing and spirited way, and say:



"Oh, I'm coming along bully!" (he was a little given to slang in his

happier moods.)  "I wrote ten pages in my journal last night--and you

know I wrote nine the night before and twelve the night before that.

Why, it's only fun!"



"What do you find to put in it, Jack?"



"Oh, everything.  Latitude and longitude, noon every day; and how many

miles we made last twenty-four hours; and all the domino games I beat and

horse billiards; and whales and sharks and porpoises; and the text of the

sermon Sundays (because that'll tell at home, you know); and the ships we

saluted and what nation they were; and which way the wind was, and

whether there was a heavy sea, and what sail we carried, though we don't

ever carry any, principally, going against a head wind always--wonder

what is the reason of that?--and how many lies Moult has told--Oh, every

thing!  I've got everything down.  My father told me to keep that

journal.  Father wouldn't take a thousand dollars for it when I get it

done."



"No, Jack; it will be worth more than a thousand dollars--when you get it

done."



"Do you?--no, but do you think it will, though?



"Yes, it will be worth at least as much as a thousand dollars--when you

get it done.  May be more."



"Well, I about half think so, myself.  It ain't no slouch of a journal."



But it shortly became a most lamentable "slouch of a journal."  One night

in Paris, after a hard day's toil in sightseeing, I said:



"Now I'll go and stroll around the cafes awhile, Jack, and give you a

chance to write up your journal, old fellow."



His countenance lost its fire.  He said:



"Well, no, you needn't mind.  I think I won't run that journal anymore.

It is awful tedious.  Do you know--I reckon I'm as much as four thousand

pages behind hand.  I haven't got any France in it at all.  First I

thought I'd leave France out and start fresh.  But that wouldn't do,

would it? The governor would say, 'Hello, here--didn't see anything in

France? That cat wouldn't fight, you know.  First I thought I'd copy

France out of the guide-book, like old Badger in the for'rard cabin,

who's writing a book, but there's more than three hundred pages of it.

Oh, I don't think a journal's any use--do you? They're only a bother,

ain't they?"



"Yes, a journal that is incomplete isn't of much use, but a journal

properly kept is worth a thousand dollars--when you've got it done."



"A thousand!--well, I should think so.  I wouldn't finish it for a

million."



His experience was only the experience of the majority of that

industrious night school in the cabin.  If you wish to inflict a

heartless and malignant punishment upon a young person, pledge him to

keep a journal a year.



A good many expedients were resorted to to keep the excursionists amused

and satisfied.  A club was formed, of all the passengers, which met in

the writing school after prayers and read aloud about the countries we

were approaching and discussed the information so obtained.



Several times the photographer of the expedition brought out his

transparent pictures and gave us a handsome magic-lantern exhibition.

His views were nearly all of foreign scenes, but there were one or two

home pictures among them.  He advertised that he would "open his

performance in the after cabin at 'two bells' (nine P.M.) and show the

passengers where they shall eventually arrive"--which was all very well,

but by a funny accident the first picture that flamed out upon the canvas

was a view of Greenwood Cemetery!



On several starlight nights we danced on the upper deck, under the

awnings, and made something of a ball-room display of brilliancy by

hanging a number of ship's lanterns to the stanchions.  Our music

consisted of the well-mixed strains of a melodeon which was a little

asthmatic and apt to catch its breath where it ought to come out strong,

a clarinet which was a little unreliable on the high keys and rather

melancholy on the low ones, and a disreputable accordion that had a leak

somewhere and breathed louder than it squawked--a more elegant term does

not occur to me just now.  However, the dancing was infinitely worse than

the music.  When the ship rolled to starboard the whole platoon of

dancers came charging down to starboard with it, and brought up in mass

at the rail; and when it rolled to port they went floundering down to

port with the same unanimity of sentiment.  Waltzers spun around

precariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying down

to the rail as if they meant to go overboard.  The Virginia reel, as

performed on board the Quaker City, had more genuine reel about it than

any reel I ever saw before, and was as full of interest to the spectator

as it was full of desperate chances and hairbreadth escapes to the

participant.  We gave up dancing, finally.



We celebrated a lady's birthday anniversary with toasts, speeches, a

poem, and so forth.  We also had a mock trial.  No ship ever went to sea

that hadn't a mock trial on board.  The purser was accused of stealing an

overcoat from stateroom No. 10.  A judge was appointed; also clerks, a

crier of the court, constables, sheriffs; counsel for the State and for

the defendant; witnesses were subpoenaed, and a jury empaneled after much

challenging.  The witnesses were stupid and unreliable and contradictory,

as witnesses always are.  The counsel were eloquent, argumentative, and

vindictively abusive of each other, as was characteristic and proper.

The case was at last submitted and duly finished by the judge with an

absurd decision and a ridiculous sentence.



The acting of charades was tried on several evenings by the young

gentlemen and ladies, in the cabins, and proved the most distinguished

success of all the amusement experiments.



An attempt was made to organize a debating club, but it was a failure.

There was no oratorical talent in the ship.



We all enjoyed ourselves--I think I can safely say that, but it was in a

rather quiet way.  We very, very seldom played the piano; we played the

flute and the clarinet together, and made good music, too, what there was

of it, but we always played the same old tune; it was a very pretty tune

--how well I remember it--I wonder when I shall ever get rid of it.  We

never played either the melodeon or the organ except at devotions--but I

am too fast: young Albert did know part of a tune something about

"O Something-Or-Other How Sweet It Is to Know That He's His What's-his-

Name" (I do not remember the exact title of it, but it was very plaintive

and full of sentiment); Albert played that pretty much all the time until

we contracted with him to restrain himself.  But nobody ever sang by

moonlight on the upper deck, and the congregational singing at church and

prayers was not of a superior order of architecture.  I put up with it as

long as I could and then joined in and tried to improve it, but this

encouraged young George to join in too, and that made a failure of it;

because George's voice was just "turning," and when he was singing a

dismal sort of bass it was apt to fly off the handle and startle

everybody with a most discordant cackle on the upper notes.  George

didn't know the tunes, either, which was also a drawback to his

performances.  I said:



"Come, now, George, don't improvise.  It looks too egotistical.  It will

provoke remark.  Just stick to 'Coronation,' like the others.  It is a

good tune--you can't improve it any, just off-hand, in this way."



"Why, I'm not trying to improve it--and I am singing like the others--

just as it is in the notes."



And he honestly thought he was, too; and so he had no one to blame but

himself when his voice caught on the center occasionally and gave him the

lockjaw.



There were those among the unregenerated who attributed the unceasing

head-winds to our distressing choir-music.  There were those who said

openly that it was taking chances enough to have such ghastly music going

on, even when it was at its best; and that to exaggerate the crime by

letting George help was simply flying in the face of Providence.  These

said that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melody

until they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship.



There were even grumblers at the prayers.  The executive officer said the

pilgrims had no charity:



"There they are, down there every night at eight bells, praying for fair

winds--when they know as well as I do that this is the only ship going

east this time of the year, but there's a thousand coming west--what's a

fair wind for us is a head wind to them--the Almighty's blowing a fair

wind for a thousand vessels, and this tribe wants him to turn it clear

around so as to accommodate one--and she a steamship at that!  It ain't

good sense, it ain't good reason, it ain't good Christianity, it ain't

common human charity.  Avast with such nonsense!"









CHAPTER V.



Taking it "by and large," as the sailors say, we had a pleasant ten days'

run from New York to the Azores islands--not a fast run, for the distance

is only twenty-four hundred miles, but a right pleasant one in the main.

True, we had head winds all the time, and several stormy experiences

which sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and made the ship

look dismal and deserted--stormy experiences that all will remember who

weathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast sheets of spray

that every now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and swept

the ship like a thunder-shower; but for the most part we had balmy summer

weather and nights that were even finer than the days.  We had the

phenomenon of a full moon located just in the same spot in the heavens at

the same hour every night.  The reason of this singular conduct on the

part of the moon did not occur to us at first, but it did afterward when

we reflected that we were gaining about twenty minutes every day because

we were going east so fast--we gained just about enough every day to keep

along with the moon.  It was becoming an old moon to the friends we had

left behind us, but to us Joshuas it stood still in the same place and

remained always the same.



Young Mr. Blucher, who is from the Far West and is on his first voyage,

was a good deal worried by the constantly changing "ship time."  He was

proud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly when

eight bells struck at noon, but he came to look after a while as if he

were losing confidence in it.  Seven days out from New York he came on

deck and said with great decision:



"This thing's a swindle!"



"What's a swindle?"



"Why, this watch.  I bought her out in Illinois--gave $150 for her--and I

thought she was good.  And, by George, she is good onshore, but somehow

she don't keep up her lick here on the water--gets seasick may be.  She

skips; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven, and then, all

of a sudden, she lets down.  I've set that old regulator up faster and

faster, till I've shoved it clear around, but it don't do any good; she

just distances every watch in the ship, and clatters along in a way

that's astonishing till it is noon, but them eight bells always gets in

about ten minutes ahead of her anyway.  I don't know what to do with her

now.  She's doing all she can--she's going her best gait, but it won't

save her.  Now, don't you know, there ain't a watch in the ship that's

making better time than she is, but what does it signify?  When you hear

them eight bells you'll find her just about ten minutes short of her

score sure."



The ship was gaining a full hour every three days, and this fellow was

trying to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her.  But, as he

had said, he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go, and the

watch was "on its best gait," and so nothing was left him but to fold his

hands and see the ship beat the race.  We sent him to the captain, and he

explained to him the mystery of "ship time" and set his troubled mind at

rest.  This young man asked a great many questions about seasickness

before we left, and wanted to know what its characteristics were and how

he was to tell when he had it.  He found out.



We saw the usual sharks, blackfish, porpoises, &c., of course, and by and

by large schools of Portuguese men-of-war were added to the regular list

of sea wonders.  Some of them were white and some of a brilliant carmine

color.  The nautilus is nothing but a transparent web of jelly that

spreads itself to catch the wind, and has fleshy-looking strings a foot

or two long dangling from it to keep it steady in the water.  It is an

accomplished sailor and has good sailor judgment.  It reefs its sail when

a storm threatens or the wind blows pretty hard, and furls it entirely

and goes down when a gale blows.  Ordinarily it keeps its sail wet and in

good sailing order by turning over and dipping it in the water for a

moment.  Seamen say the nautilus is only found in these waters between

the 35th and 45th parallels of latitude.



At three o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first of June, we were

awakened and notified that the Azores islands were in sight.  I said I

did not take any interest in islands at three o'clock in the morning.

But another persecutor came, and then another and another, and finally

believing that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in

peace, I got up and went sleepily on deck.  It was five and a half

o'clock now, and a raw, blustering morning.  The passengers were huddled

about the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators, and all were

wrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitiless

gale and the drenching spray.



The island in sight was Flores.  It seemed only a mountain of mud

standing up out of the dull mists of the sea.  But as we bore down upon

it the sun came out and made it a beautiful picture--a mass of green

farms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet and

mingled its upper outlines with the clouds.  It was ribbed with sharp,

steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons, and here and there on the

heights, rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements and

castles; and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight, that

painted summit, and slope and glen, with bands of fire, and left belts of

somber shade between.  It was the aurora borealis of the frozen pole

exiled to a summer land!



We skirted around two-thirds of the island, four miles from shore, and

all the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to settle

disputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of trees or

groves of weeds, or whether the white villages down by the sea were

really villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries.  Finally

we stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel, and Flores shortly became a

dome of mud again and sank down among the mists, and disappeared.  But to

many a seasick passenger it was good to see the green hills again, and

all were more cheerful after this episode than anybody could have

expected them to be, considering how sinfully early they had gotten up.



But we had to change our purpose about San Miguel, for a storm came up

about noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense

dictated a run for shelter.  Therefore we steered for the nearest island

of the group--Fayal (the people there pronounce it Fy-all, and put the

accent on the first syllable).  We anchored in the open roadstead of

Horta, half a mile from the shore.  The town has eight thousand to ten

thousand inhabitants.  Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of

fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more

attractive.  It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are

three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear

to their summits--not a foot of soil left idle.  Every farm and every

acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty

it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that

blow there.  These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava

walls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.



The islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has Portuguese

characteristics about it.  But more of that anon.  A swarm of swarthy,

noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, with

brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship's

sides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore

at so much a head, silver coin of any country.  We landed under the walls

of a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders,

which Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever

to get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to

move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find

it again when they needed it.  The group on the pier was a rusty one--men

and women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and

unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars.  They

trooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid

of them.  We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these

vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every moment

excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back,

just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his

advertising trip from street to street.  It was very flattering to me to

be part of the material for such a sensation.  Here and there in the

doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on.  This hood is

of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a

marvel of ugliness.  It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is

unfathomably deep.  It fits like a circus tent, and a woman's head is

hidden away in it like the man's who prompts the singers from his tin

shed in the stage of an opera.  There is no particle of trimming about

this monstrous capote, as they call it--it is just a plain, ugly dead-

blue mass of sail, and a woman can't go within eight points of the wind

with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all.  The

general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will

remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its

capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to

tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.



The Portuguese pennies, or reis (pronounced rays), are prodigious.  It

takes one thousand reis to make a dollar, and all financial estimates are

made in reis.  We did not know this until after we had found it out

through Blucher.  Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on

solid land once more that he wanted to give a feast--said he had heard it

was a cheap land, and he was bound to have a grand banquet.  He invited

nine of us, and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel.  In

the midst of the jollity produced by good cigars, good wine, and passable

anecdotes, the landlord presented his bill.  Blucher glanced at it and

his countenance fell.  He took another look to assure himself that his

senses had not deceived him and then read the items aloud, in a faltering

voice, while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes:



"'Ten dinners, at 600 reis, 6,000 reis!'  Ruin and desolation!



"'Twenty-five cigars, at 100 reis, 2,500 reis!'  Oh, my sainted mother!



"'Eleven bottles of wine, at 1,200 reis, 13,200 reis!'  Be with us all!



"'TOTAL, TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED REIS!'  The suffering Moses!

There ain't money enough in the ship to pay that bill!  Go--leave me to

my misery, boys, I am a ruined community."



I think it was the blankest-looking party I ever saw.  Nobody could say a

word.  It was as if every soul had been stricken dumb.  Wine glasses

descended slowly to the table, their contents untasted.  Cigars dropped

unnoticed from nerveless fingers.  Each man sought his neighbor's eye,

but found in it no ray of hope, no encouragement.  At last the fearful

silence was broken.  The shadow of a desperate resolve settled upon

Blucher's countenance like a cloud, and he rose up and said:



"Landlord, this is a low, mean swindle, and I'll never, never stand it.

Here's a hundred and fifty dollars, Sir, and it's all you'll get--I'll

swim in blood before I'll pay a cent more."



Our spirits rose and the landlord's fell--at least we thought so; he was

confused, at any rate, notwithstanding he had not understood a word that

had been said.  He glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to Blucher

several times and then went out.  He must have visited an American, for

when he returned, he brought back his bill translated into a language

that a Christian could understand--thus:



10 dinners, 6,000 reis, or .  .  .$6.00



25 cigars, 2,500 reis, or .  .  .  2.50



11 bottles wine, 13,200 reis, or  13.20



Total 21,700 reis, or .  .  .  . $21.70



Happiness reigned once more in Blucher's dinner party.  More refreshments

were ordered.









CHAPTER VI.



I think the Azores must be very little known in America.  Out of our

whole ship's company there was not a solitary individual who knew

anything whatever about them.  Some of the party, well read concerning

most other lands, had no other information about the Azores than that

they were a group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic,

something more than halfway between New York and Gibraltar.  That was

all.  These considerations move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts

just here.



The community is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor,

shiftless, sleepy, and lazy.  There is a civil governor, appointed by the

King of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supreme

control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure.  The islands

contain a population of about 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese.

Everything is staid and settled, for the country was one hundred years

old when Columbus discovered America.  The principal crop is corn, and

they raise it and grind it just as their great-great-great-grandfathers

did.  They plow with a board slightly shod with iron; their trifling

little harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills grind the

corn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent to

feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from

going to sleep.  When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and

actually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are

in proper position, instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could

be moved instead of the mill.  Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, after

the fashion prevalent in the time of Methuselah.  There is not a

wheelbarrow in the land--they carry everything on their heads, or on

donkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose wheels are solid blocks of

wood and whose axles turn with the wheel.  There is not a modern plow in

the islands or a threshing machine.  All attempts to introduce them have

failed.  The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to

shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did

before him.  The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I saw

no chimneys in the town.  The donkeys and the men, women, and children of

a family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravaged

by vermin, and are truly happy.  The people lie, and cheat the stranger,

and are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their

dead.  The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys

they eat and sleep with.  The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp

are the half a dozen well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and the

soldiers of the little garrison.  The wages of a laborer are twenty to

twenty-four cents a day, and those of a good mechanic about twice as

much.  They count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar, and this makes

them rich and contented.  Fine grapes used to grow in the islands, and an

excellent wine was made and exported.  But a disease killed all the vines

fifteen years ago, and since that time no wine has been made.  The

islands being wholly of volcanic origin, the soil is necessarily very

rich.  Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation, and two or three

crops a year of each article are produced, but nothing is exported save a

few oranges--chiefly to England.  Nobody comes here, and nobody goes

away.  News is a thing unknown in Fayal.  A thirst for it is a passion

equally unknown.  A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our

civil war was over.  Because, he said, somebody had told him it was--or

at least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something like

that!  And when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of the

Tribune, the Herald, and Times, he was surprised to find later news in

them from Lisbon than he had just received by the little monthly steamer.

He was told that it came by cable.  He said he knew they had tried to lay

a cable ten years ago, but it had been in his mind somehow that they

hadn't succeeded!



It is in communities like this that Jesuit humbuggery flourishes.  We

visited a Jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it a

piece of the veritable cross upon which our Saviour was crucified.  It

was polished and hard, and in as excellent a state of preservation as if

the dread tragedy on Calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteen

centuries ago.  But these confiding people believe in that piece of wood

unhesitatingly.



In a chapel of the cathedral is an altar with facings of solid silver--at

least they call it so, and I think myself it would go a couple of hundred

to the ton (to speak after the fashion of the silver miners)--and before

it is kept forever burning a small lamp.  A devout lady who died, left

money and contracted for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul, and

also stipulated that this lamp should be kept lighted always, day and

night.  She did all this before she died, you understand.  It is a very

small lamp and a very dim one, and it could not work her much damage, I

think, if it went out altogether.



The great altar of the cathedral and also three or four minor ones are a

perfect mass of gilt gimcracks and gingerbread.  And they have a swarm of

rusty, dusty, battered apostles standing around the filagree work, some

on one leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other, and

some with two or three fingers gone, and some with not enough nose left

to blow--all of them crippled and discouraged, and fitter subjects for

the hospital than the cathedral.



The walls of the chancel are of porcelain, all pictured over with figures

of almost life size, very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fanciful

costumes of two centuries ago.  The design was a history of something or

somebody, but none of us were learned enough to read the story.  The old

father, reposing under a stone close by, dated 1686, might have told us

if he could have risen.  But he didn't.



As we came down through the town we encountered a squad of little donkeys

ready saddled for use.  The saddles were peculiar, to say the least.

They consisted of a sort of saw-buck with a small mattress on it, and

this furniture covered about half the donkey.  There were no stirrups,

but really such supports were not needed--to use such a saddle was the

next thing to riding a dinner table--there was ample support clear out to

one's knee joints.  A pack of ragged Portuguese muleteers crowded around

us, offering their beasts at half a dollar an hour--more rascality to the

stranger, for the market price is sixteen cents.  Half a dozen of us

mounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the indignity of making a

ridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal streets of a town

of 10,000 inhabitants.



We started.  It was not a trot, a gallop, or a canter, but a stampede,

and made up of all possible or conceivable gaits.  No spurs were

necessary.  There was a muleteer to every donkey and a dozen volunteers

beside, and they banged the donkeys with their goad sticks, and pricked

them with their spikes, and shouted something that sounded like "Sekki-

yah!" and kept up a din and a racket that was worse than Bedlam itself.

These rascals were all on foot, but no matter, they were always up to

time--they can outrun and outlast a donkey.  Altogether, ours was a

lively and a picturesque procession, and drew crowded audiences to the

balconies wherever we went.



Blucher could do nothing at all with his donkey.  The beast scampered

zigzag across the road and the others ran into him; he scraped Blucher

against carts and the corners of houses; the road was fenced in with high

stone walls, and the donkey gave him a polishing first on one side and

then on the other, but never once took the middle; he finally came to the

house he was born in and darted into the parlor, scraping Blucher off at

the doorway.  After remounting, Blucher said to the muleteer, "Now,

that's enough, you know; you go slow hereafter."



But the fellow knew no English and did not understand, so he simply said,

"Sekki-yah!" and the donkey was off again like a shot.  He turned a comer

suddenly, and Blucher went over his head.  And, to speak truly, every

mule stumbled over the two, and the whole cavalcade was piled up in a

heap.  No harm done.  A fall from one of those donkeys is of little more

consequence than rolling off a sofa.  The donkeys all stood still after

the catastrophe and waited for their dismembered saddles to be patched up

and put on by the noisy muleteers.  Blucher was pretty angry and wanted

to swear, but every time he opened his mouth his animal did so also and

let off a series of brays that drowned all other sounds.



It was fun, scurrying around the breezy hills and through the beautiful

canyons.  There was that rare thing, novelty, about it; it was a fresh,

new, exhilarating sensation, this donkey riding, and worth a hundred worn

and threadbare home pleasures.



The roads were a wonder, and well they might be.  Here was an island with

only a handful of people in it--25,000--and yet such fine roads do not

exist in the United States outside of Central Park.  Everywhere you go,

in any direction, you find either a hard, smooth, level thoroughfare,

just sprinkled with black lava sand, and bordered with little gutters

neatly paved with small smooth pebbles, or compactly paved ones like

Broadway.  They talk much of the Russ pavement in New York, and call it a

new invention--yet here they have been using it in this remote little

isle of the sea for two hundred years!  Every street in Horta is

handsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks, and the surface is neat and

true as a floor--not marred by holes like Broadway.  And every road is

fenced in by tall, solid lava walls, which will last a thousand years in

this land where frost is unknown.  They are very thick, and are often

plastered and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone.

Trees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down, and contrast

their bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and

make them beautiful.  The trees and vines stretch across these narrow

roadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be riding

through a tunnel.  The pavements, the roads, and the bridges are all

government work.



The bridges are of a single span--a single arch--of cut stone, without a

support, and paved on top with flags of lava and ornamental pebblework.

Everywhere are walls, walls, walls, and all of them tasteful and

handsome--and eternally substantial; and everywhere are those marvelous

pavements, so neat, so smooth, and so indestructible.  And if ever roads

and streets and the outsides of houses were perfectly free from any sign

or semblance of dirt, or dust, or mud, or uncleanliness of any kind, it

is Horta, it is Fayal.  The lower classes of the people, in their persons

and their domiciles, are not clean--but there it stops--the town and the

island are miracles of cleanliness.



We arrived home again finally, after a ten-mile excursion, and the

irrepressible muleteers scampered at our heels through the main street,

goading the donkeys, shouting the everlasting "Sekki-yah," and singing

"John Brown's Body" in ruinous English.



When we were dismounted and it came to settling, the shouting and jawing

and swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearly

deafening.  One fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his

donkey; another claimed half a dollar for pricking him up, another a

quarter for helping in that service, and about fourteen guides presented

bills for showing us the way through the town and its environs; and every

vagrant of them was more vociferous, and more vehement and more frantic

in gesture than his neighbor.  We paid one guide and paid for one

muleteer to each donkey.



The mountains on some of the islands are very high.  We sailed along the

shore of the island of Pico, under a stately green pyramid that rose up

with one unbroken sweep from our very feet to an altitude of 7,613 feet,

and thrust its summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in a

fog!



We got plenty of fresh oranges, lemons, figs, apricots, etc., in these

Azores, of course.  But I will desist.  I am not here to write Patent

Office reports.



We are on our way to Gibraltar, and shall reach there five or six days

out from the Azores.









CHAPTER VII.



A week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea; a week of

seasickness and deserted cabins; of lonely quarterdecks drenched with

spray--spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with

a white crust of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in the

shelter of the lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating

"clouds" and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at

night.



And the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all.  There was no

thunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistling

of the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters.

But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then paused

an instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again, as from

a precipice.  The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain.  The

blackness of darkness was everywhere.  At long intervals a flash of

lightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving

world of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky cordage to

glittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster!



Fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and

the spray.  Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, and

it seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and

see the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral

cabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad on

the ocean.  And once out--once where they could see the ship struggling

in the strong grasp of the storm--once where they could hear the shriek

of the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic

picture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fierce

fascination they could not resist, and so remained.  It was a wild night

--and a very, very long one.



Everybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven o'clock this lovely

morning of the thirtieth of June with the glad news that land was in

sight!  It was a rare thing and a joyful, to see all the ship's family

abroad once more, albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenance

could only partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms had

wrought there.  But dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure, pallid cheeks

flushed again, and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from the

quickening influences of the bright, fresh morning.  Yea, and from a

still more potent influence: the worn castaways were to see the blessed

land again!--and to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in

all their thoughts.



Within the hour we were fairly within the Straits of Gibraltar, the tall

yellow-splotched hills of Africa on our right, with their bases veiled in

a blue haze and their summits swathed in clouds--the same being according

to Scripture, which says that "clouds and darkness are over the land."

The words were spoken of this particular portion of Africa, I believe.

On our left were the granite-ribbed domes of old Spain.  The strait is

only thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part.



At short intervals along the Spanish shore were quaint-looking old stone

towers--Moorish, we thought--but learned better afterwards.  In former

times the Morocco rascals used to coast along the Spanish Main in their

boats till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself, and then dart in

and capture a Spanish village and carry off all the pretty women they

could find.  It was a pleasant business, and was very popular.  The

Spaniards built these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep a

sharper lookout on the Moroccan speculators.



The picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of the

changeless sea, and by and by the ship's company grew wonderfully

cheerful.  But while we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the

lowlands robed in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chained

every eye like a magnet--a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas till

she was one towering mass of bellying sail!  She came speeding over the

sea like a great bird.  Africa and Spain were forgotten.  All homage was

for the beautiful stranger.  While everybody gazed she swept superbly by

and flung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze!  Quicker than thought,

hats and handkerchiefs flashed in the air, and a cheer went up!  She was

beautiful before--she was radiant now.  Many a one on our decks knew then

for the first time how tame a sight his country's flag is at home

compared to what it is in a foreign land.  To see it is to see a vision

of home itself and all its idols, and feel a thrill that would stir a

very river of sluggish blood!



We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already the

African one, "Ape's Hill," a grand old mountain with summit streaked with

granite ledges, was in sight.  The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar,

was yet to come.  The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the

head of navigation and the end of the world.  The information the

ancients didn't have was very voluminous.  Even the prophets wrote book

after book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted at the

existence of a great continent on our side of the water; yet they must

have known it was there, I should think.



In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seemingly

in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by

the sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveled

parrot to tell us it was Gibraltar.  There could not be two rocks like

that in one kingdom.



The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say, by

1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base.  One

side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the

side of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep

slant which an army would find very difficult to climb.  At the foot of

this slant is the walled town of Gibraltar--or rather the town occupies

part of the slant.  Everywhere--on hillside, in the precipice, by the

sea, on the heights--everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is clad

with masonry and bristling with guns.  It makes a striking and lively

picture from whatsoever point you contemplate it.  It is pushed out into

the sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive of

a "gob" of mud on the end of a shingle.  A few hundred yards of this flat

ground at its base belongs to the English, and then, extending across the

strip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter of

a mile, comes the "Neutral Ground," a space two or three hundred yards

wide, which is free to both parties.



"Are you going through Spain to Paris?"  That question was bandied about

the ship day and night from Fayal to Gibraltar, and I thought I never

could get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or more

tired of answering, "I don't know."  At the last moment six or seven had

sufficient decision of character to make up their minds to go, and did

go, and I felt a sense of relief at once--it was forever too late now and

I could make up my mind at my leisure not to go.  I must have a

prodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a week sometimes to

make it up.



But behold how annoyances repeat themselves.  We had no sooner gotten rid

of the Spain distress than the Gibraltar guides started another--a

tiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing about

it, even in the first place: "That high hill yonder is called the Queen's

Chair; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair there

when the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said she

would never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the

fortresses.  If the English hadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag

for a few hours one day, she'd have had to break her oath or die up

there."



We rode on asses and mules up the steep, narrow streets and entered the

subterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the rock.  These

galleries are like spacious railway tunnels, and at short intervals in

them great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or six

hundred feet above the ocean.  There is a mile or so of this subterranean

work, and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor.  The gallery

guns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans, but they might

as well not be there, I should think, for an army could hardly climb the

perpendicular wall of the rock anyhow.  Those lofty portholes afford

superb views of the sea, though.  At one place, where a jutting crag was

hollowed out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon and

whose windows were portholes, a glimpse was caught of a hill not far

away, and a soldier said:



"That high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair; it is because a queen

of Spain placed her chair there once when the French and Spanish troops

were besieging Gibraltar, and said she would never move from the spot

till the English flag was lowered from the fortresses.  If the English

hadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day,

she'd have had to break her oath or die up there."



On the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good while, and no doubt

the mules were tired.  They had a right to be.  The military road was

good, but rather steep, and there was a good deal of it.  The view from

the narrow ledge was magnificent; from it vessels seeming like the

tiniest little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes,

and other vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty, they said,

and invisible to the naked eye, could be clearly distinguished through

those same telescopes.  Below, on one side, we looked down upon an

endless mass of batteries and on the other straight down to the sea.



While I was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart, and cooling my

baking head in the delicious breeze, an officious guide belonging to

another party came up and said:



"Senor, that high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair--"



"Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land.  Have pity on me.  Don't

--now don't inflict that most in-FERNAL old legend on me anymore today!"



There--I had used strong language after promising I would never do so

again; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear.  If you

had been bored so, when you had the noble panorama of Spain and Africa

and the blue Mediterranean spread abroad at your feet, and wanted to gaze

and enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence, you might have

even burst into stronger language than I did.



Gibraltar has stood several protracted sieges, one of them of nearly four

years' duration (it failed), and the English only captured it by

stratagem.  The wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying so

impossible a project as the taking it by assault--and yet it has been

tried more than once.



The Moors held the place twelve hundred years ago, and a staunch old

castle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town,

with moss-grown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired in

battles and sieges that are forgotten now.  A secret chamber in the rock

behind it was discovered some time ago, which contained a sword of

exquisite workmanship, and some quaint old armor of a fashion that

antiquaries are not acquainted with, though it is supposed to be Roman.

Roman armor and Roman relics of various kinds have been found in a cave

in the sea extremity of Gibraltar; history says Rome held this part of

the country about the Christian era, and these things seem to confirm the

statement.



In that cave also are found human bones, crusted with a very thick, stony

coating, and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only lived

before the flood, but as much as ten thousand years before it.  It may be

true--it looks reasonable enough--but as long as those parties can't vote

anymore, the matter can be of no great public interest.  In this cave

likewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in every

part of Africa, yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any

portion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar!  So the theory is that

the channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land, and that the

low, neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it was

once ocean, and of course that these African animals, being over at

Gibraltar (after rock, perhaps--there is plenty there), got closed out

when the great change occurred.  The hills in Africa, across the channel,

are full of apes, and there are now and always have been apes on the rock

of Gibraltar--but not elsewhere in Spain!  The subject is an interesting

one.



There is an English garrison at Gibraltar of 6,000 or 7,000 men, and so

uniforms of flaming red are plenty; and red and blue, and undress

costumes of snowy white, and also the queer uniform of the bare-kneed

Highlander; and one sees soft-eyed Spanish girls from San Roque, and

veiled Moorish beauties (I suppose they are beauties) from Tarifa, and

turbaned, sashed, and trousered Moorish merchants from Fez, and long-

robed, bare-legged, ragged Muhammadan vagabonds from Tetuan and Tangier,

some brown, some yellow and some as black as virgin ink--and Jews from

all around, in gabardine, skullcap, and slippers, just as they are in

pictures and theaters, and just as they were three thousand years ago, no

doubt.  You can easily understand that a tribe (somehow our pilgrims

suggest that expression, because they march in a straggling procession

through these foreign places with such an Indian-like air of complacency

and independence about them) like ours, made up from fifteen or sixteen

states of the Union, found enough to stare at in this shifting panorama

of fashion today.



Speaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people among

us who are sometimes an annoyance.  However, I do not count the Oracle in

that list.  I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass who

eats for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would have

any right to look, and never uses a one-syllable word when he can think

of a longer one, and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of

any long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place; yet he will

serenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up

complacently with quotations from authors who never existed, and finally

when cornered will slide to the other side of the question, say he has

been there all the time, and come back at you with your own spoken

arguments, only with the big words all tangled, and play them in your

very teeth as original with himself.  He reads a chapter in the

guidebooks, mixes the facts all up, with his bad memory, and then goes

off to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has been

festering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college from

erudite authors who are dead now and out of print.  This morning at

breakfast he pointed out of the window and said:



"Do you see that there hill out there on that African coast?  It's one of

them Pillows of Herkewls, I should say--and there's the ultimate one

alongside of it."



"The ultimate one--that is a good word--but the pillars are not both on

the same side of the strait."  (I saw he had been deceived by a

carelessly written sentence in the guidebook.)



"Well, it ain't for you to say, nor for me.  Some authors states it that

way, and some states it different.  Old Gibbons don't say nothing about

it--just shirks it complete--Gibbons always done that when he got stuck--

but there is Rolampton, what does he say?  Why, be says that they was

both on the same side, and Trinculian, and Sobaster, and Syraccus, and

Langomarganbl----"



"Oh, that will do--that's enough.  If you have got your hand in for

inventing authors and testimony, I have nothing more to say--let them be

on the same side."



We don't mind the Oracle.  We rather like him.  We can tolerate the

Oracle very easily, but we have a poet and a good-natured enterprising

idiot on board, and they do distress the company.  The one gives copies

of his verses to consuls, commanders, hotel keepers, Arabs, Dutch--to

anybody, in fact, who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindly

meant.  His poetry is all very well on shipboard, notwithstanding when he

wrote an "Ode to the Ocean in a Storm" in one half hour, and an

"Apostrophe to the Rooster in the Waist of the Ship" in the next, the

transition was considered to be rather abrupt; but when he sends an

invoice of rhymes to the Governor of Fayal and another to the commander

in chief and other dignitaries in Gibraltar with the compliments of the

Laureate of the Ship, it is not popular with the passengers.



The other personage I have mentioned is young and green, and not bright,

not learned, and not wise.  He will be, though, someday if he recollects

the answers to all his questions.  He is known about the ship as the

"Interrogation Point," and this by constant use has become shortened to

"Interrogation."  He has distinguished himself twice already.  In Fayal

they pointed out a hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1,100 feet

long.  And they told him there was a tunnel 2,000 feet long and 1,000

feet high running through the hill, from end to end.  He believed it.  He

repeated it to everybody, discussed it, and read it from his notes.

Finally, he took a useful hint from this remark, which a thoughtful old

pilgrim made:



"Well, yes, it is a little remarkable--singular tunnel altogether--stands

up out of the top of the hill about two hundred feet, and one end of it

sticks out of the hill about nine hundred!"



Here in Gibraltar he corners these educated British officers and badgers

them with braggadocio about America and the wonders she can perform!  He

told one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knock

Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea!



At this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasure

excursion of our own devising.  We form rather more than half the list of

white passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable Moorish

town of Tangier, Africa.  Nothing could be more absolutely certain than

that we are enjoying ourselves.  One can not do otherwise who speeds over

these sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunny

land.  Care cannot assail us here.  We are out of its jurisdiction.



We even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of Malabat

(a stronghold of the Emperor of Morocco) without a twinge of fear.

The whole garrison turned out under arms and assumed a threatening

attitude--yet still we did not fear.  The entire garrison marched and

counter-marched within the rampart, in full view--yet notwithstanding

even this, we never flinched.



I suppose we really do not know what fear is.  I inquired the name of the

garrison of the fortress of Malabat, and they said it was Mehemet Ali Ben

Sancom.  I said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons to

help him; but they said no, he had nothing to do but hold the place, and

he was competent to do that, had done it two years already.  That was

evidence which one could not well refute.  There is nothing like

reputation.



Every now and then my glove purchase in Gibraltar last night intrudes

itself upon me.  Dan and the ship's surgeon and I had been up to the

great square, listening to the music of the fine military bands and

contemplating English and Spanish female loveliness and fashion, and at

nine o'clock were on our way to the theater, when we met the General, the

Judge, the Commodore, the Colonel, and the Commissioner of the United

States of America to Europe, Asia, and Africa, who had been to the Club

House to register their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare;

and they told us to go over to the little variety store near the Hall of

Justice and buy some kid gloves.  They said they were elegant and very

moderate in price.  It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid

gloves, and we acted upon the hint.  A very handsome young lady in the

store offered me a pair of blue gloves.  I did not want blue, but she

said they would look very pretty on a hand like mine.  The remark touched

me tenderly.  I glanced furtively at my hand, and somehow it did seem

rather a comely member.  I tried a glove on my left and blushed a little.

Manifestly the size was too small for me.  But I felt gratified when she

said:



"Oh, it is just right!"  Yet I knew it was no such thing.



I tugged at it diligently, but it was discouraging work.  She said:



"Ah!  I see you are accustomed to wearing kid gloves--but some gentlemen

are so awkward about putting them on."



It was the last compliment I had expected.  I only understand putting on

the buckskin article perfectly.  I made another effort and tore the glove

from the base of the thumb into the palm of the hand--and tried to hide

the rent.  She kept up her compliments, and I kept up my determination to

deserve them or die:



"Ah, you have had experience!  [A rip down the back of the hand.] They

are just right for you--your hand is very small--if they tear you need

not pay for them.  [A rent across the middle.]  I can always tell when a

gentleman understands putting on kid gloves.  There is a grace about it

that only comes with long practice."  The whole after-guard of the glove

"fetched away," as the sailors say, the fabric parted across the

knuckles, and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin.



I was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise on

the angel's hands.  I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but I

hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the

proceedings.  I wished they were in Jericho.  I felt exquisitely mean

when I said cheerfully:



"This one does very well; it fits elegantly.  I like a glove that fits.

No, never mind, ma'am, never mind; I'll put the other on in the street.

It is warm here."



It was warm.  It was the warmest place I ever was in.  I paid the bill,

and as I passed out with a fascinating bow I thought I detected a light

in the woman's eye that was gently ironical; and when I looked back from

the street, and she was laughing all to herself about something or other,

I said to myself with withering sarcasm, "Oh, certainly; you know how to

put on kid gloves, don't you?  A self-complacent ass, ready to be

flattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take the

trouble to do it!"



The silence of the boys annoyed me.  Finally Dan said musingly:



"Some gentlemen don't know how to put on kid gloves at all, but some do."



And the doctor said (to the moon, I thought):



"But it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on kid

gloves."



Dan soliloquized after a pause:



"Ah, yes; there is a grace about it that only comes with long, very long

practice."



"Yes, indeed, I've noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like he

was dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail, he understands putting

on kid gloves; he's had ex--"



"Boys, enough of a thing's enough!  You think you are very smart, I

suppose, but I don't.  And if you go and tell any of those old gossips in

the ship about this thing, I'll never forgive you for it; that's all."



They let me alone then for the time being.  We always let each other

alone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke.  But they had

bought gloves, too, as I did.  We threw all the purchases away together

this morning.  They were coarse, unsubstantial, freckled all over with

broad yellow splotches, and could neither stand wear nor public

exhibition.  We had entertained an angel unawares, but we did not take

her in.  She did that for us.



Tangier!  A tribe of stalwart Moors are wading into the sea to carry us

ashore on their backs from the small boats.









CHAPTER VIII.



This is royal!  Let those who went up through Spain make the best of it--

these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco suit our little party well

enough.  We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present.

Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time.  Elsewhere we

have found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but always

with things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before, and

so the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force.  We wanted

something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign--foreign from top to

bottom--foreign from center to circumference--foreign inside and outside

and all around--nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness--

nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun.

And lo!  In Tangier we have found it.  Here is not the slightest thing

that ever we have seen save in pictures--and we always mistrusted the

pictures before.  We cannot anymore.  The pictures used to seem

exaggerations--they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality.  But

behold, they were not wild enough--they were not fanciful enough--they

have not told half the story.  Tangier is a foreign land if ever there

was one, and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book save

The Arabian Nights.  Here are no white men visible, yet swarms of

humanity are all about us.  Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in

a massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old.  All the

houses nearly are one-and two-story, made of thick walls of stone,

plastered outside, square as a dry-goods box, flat as a floor on top, no

cornices, whitewashed all over--a crowded city of snowy tombs!  And the

doors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures; the

floors are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tesselated, many-colored

porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez; in red tiles and broad

bricks that time cannot wear; there is no furniture in the rooms (of

Jewish dwellings) save divans--what there is in Moorish ones no man may

know; within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter.  And the

streets are oriental--some of them three feet wide, some six, but only

two that are over a dozen; a man can blockade the most of them by

extending his body across them.  Isn't it an oriental picture?



There are stalwart Bedouins of the desert here, and stately Moors proud

of a history that goes back to the night of time; and Jews whose fathers

fled hither centuries upon centuries ago; and swarthy Riffians from the

mountains--born cut-throats--and original, genuine Negroes as black as

Moses; and howling dervishes and a hundred breeds of Arabs--all sorts and

descriptions of people that are foreign and curious to look upon.



And their dresses are strange beyond all description.  Here is a bronzed

Moor in a prodigious white turban, curiously embroidered jacket, gold and

crimson sash, of many folds, wrapped round and round his waist, trousers

that only come a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuff

in them, ornamented scimitar, bare shins, stockingless feet, yellow

slippers, and gun of preposterous length--a mere soldier!--I thought he

was the Emperor at least.  And here are aged Moors with flowing white

beards and long white robes with vast cowls; and Bedouins with long,

cowled, striped cloaks; and Negroes and Riffians with heads clean-shaven

except a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or, rather, upon the after

corner of the skull; and all sorts of barbarians in all sorts of weird

costumes, and all more or less ragged.  And here are Moorish women who

are enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes, and whose sex can

only be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible and

never look at men of their own race, or are looked at by them in public.

Here are five thousand Jews in blue gabardines, sashes about their

waists, slippers upon their feet, little skullcaps upon the backs of

their heads, hair combed down on the forehead, and cut straight across

the middle of it from side to side--the selfsame fashion their Tangier

ancestors have worn for I don't know how many bewildering centuries.

Their feet and ankles are bare.  Their noses are all hooked, and hooked

alike.  They all resemble each other so much that one could almost

believe they were of one family.  Their women are plump and pretty, and

do smile upon a Christian in a way which is in the last degree

comforting.



What a funny old town it is!  It seems like profanation to laugh and jest

and bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics.  Only the

stately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophet

are suited to a venerable antiquity like this.  Here is a crumbling wall

that was old when Columbus discovered America; was old when Peter the

Hermit roused the knightly men of the Middle Ages to arm for the first

Crusade; was old when Charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchanted

castles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the olden

time; was old when Christ and his disciples walked the earth; stood where

it stands today when the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought and

sold in the streets of ancient Thebes!



The Phoenicians, the Carthagenians, the English, Moors, Romans, all have

battled for Tangier--all have won it and lost it.  Here is a ragged,

oriental-looking Negro from some desert place in interior Africa, filling

his goatskin with water from a stained and battered fountain built by the

Romans twelve hundred years ago.  Yonder is a ruined arch of a bridge

built by Julius Caesar nineteen hundred years ago.  Men who had seen the

infant Saviour in the Virgin's arms have stood upon it, maybe.



Near it are the ruins of a dockyard where Caesar repaired his ships and

loaded them with grain when he invaded Britain, fifty years before the

Christian era.



Here, under the quiet stars, these old streets seem thronged with the

phantoms of forgotten ages.  My eyes are resting upon a spot where stood

a monument which was seen and described by Roman historians less than two

thousand years ago, whereon was inscribed:



               "WE ARE THE CANAANITES.  WE ARE THEY THAT

               HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE LAND OF CANAAN

               BY THE JEWISH ROBBER, JOSHUA."



Joshua drove them out, and they came here.  Not many leagues from here is

a tribe of Jews whose ancestors fled thither after an unsuccessful revolt

against King David, and these their descendants are still under a ban and

keep to themselves.



Tangier has been mentioned in history for three thousand years.  And it

was a town, though a queer one, when Hercules, clad in his lion skin,

landed here, four thousand years ago.  In these streets he met Anitus,

the king of the country, and brained him with his club, which was the

fashion among gentlemen in those days.  The people of Tangier (called

Tingis then) lived in the rudest possible huts and dressed in skins and

carried clubs, and were as savage as the wild beasts they were constantly

obliged to war with.  But they were a gentlemanly race and did no work.

They lived on the natural products of the land.  Their king's country

residence was at the famous Garden of Hesperides, seventy miles down the

coast from here.  The garden, with its golden apples (oranges), is gone

now--no vestige of it remains.  Antiquarians concede that such a

personage as Hercules did exist in ancient times and agree that he was an

enterprising and energetic man, but decline to believe him a good, bona-

fide god, because that would be unconstitutional.



Down here at Cape Spartel is the celebrated cave of Hercules, where that

hero took refuge when he was vanquished and driven out of the Tangier

country.  It is full of inscriptions in the dead languages, which fact

makes me think Hercules could not have traveled much, else he would not

have kept a journal.



Five days' journey from here--say two hundred miles--are the ruins of an

ancient city, of whose history there is neither record nor tradition.

And yet its arches, its columns, and its statues proclaim it to have been

built by an enlightened race.



The general size of a store in Tangier is about that of an ordinary

shower bath in a civilized land.  The Muhammadan merchant, tinman,

shoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits cross-legged on the floor and

reaches after any article you may want to buy.  You can rent a whole

block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month.  The market people

crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons,

apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not much

larger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog.  The scene is lively, is

picturesque, and smells like a police court.  The Jewish money-changers

have their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins

and transferring them from one bushel basket to another.  They don't coin

much money nowadays, I think.  I saw none but what was dated four or five

hundred years back, and was badly worn and battered.  These coins are not

very valuable.  Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have

money suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said

he bad "swamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, and the head

of the firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the

change."  I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling

myself.  I am not proud on account of having so much money, though.  I

care nothing for wealth.



The Moors have some small silver coins and also some silver slugs worth a

dollar each.  The latter are exceedingly scarce--so much so that when

poor ragged Arabs see one they beg to be allowed to kiss it.



They have also a small gold coin worth two dollars.  And that reminds me

of something.  When Morocco is in a state of war, Arab couriers carry

letters through the country and charge a liberal postage.  Every now and

then they fall into the hands of marauding bands and get robbed.

Therefore, warned by experience, as soon as they have collected two

dollars' worth of money they exchange it for one of those little gold

pieces, and when robbers come upon them, swallow it.  The stratagem was

good while it was unsuspected, but after that the marauders simply gave

the sagacious United States mail an emetic and sat down to wait.



The Emperor of Morocco is a soulless despot, and the great officers under

him are despots on a smaller scale.  There is no regular system of

taxation, but when the Emperor or the Bashaw want money, they levy on

some rich man, and he has to furnish the cash or go to prison.

Therefore, few men in Morocco dare to be rich.  It is too dangerous a

luxury.  Vanity occasionally leads a man to display wealth, but sooner or

later the Emperor trumps up a charge against him--any sort of one will

do--and confiscates his property.  Of course, there are many rich men in

the empire, but their money is buried, and they dress in rags and

counterfeit poverty.  Every now and then the Emperor imprisons a man who

is suspected of the crime of being rich, and makes things so

uncomfortable for him that he is forced to discover where he has hidden

his money.



Moors and Jews sometimes place themselves under the protection of the

foreign consuls, and then they can flout their riches in the Emperor's

face with impunity.









CHAPTER IX.



About the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon, after landing here,

came near finishing that heedless Blucher.  We had just mounted some

mules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the stately,

the princely, the magnificent Hadji Muhammad Lamarty (may his tribe

increase!) when we came upon a fine Moorish mosque, with tall tower, rich

with checker-work of many-colored porcelain, and every part and portion

of the edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the Alhambra, and

Blucher started to ride into the open doorway.  A startling "Hi-hi!" from

our camp followers and a loud "Halt!" from an English gentleman in the

party checked the adventurer, and then we were informed that so dire a

profanation is it for a Christian dog to set foot upon the sacred

threshold of a Moorish mosque that no amount of purification can ever

make it fit for the faithful to pray in again.  Had Blucher succeeded in

entering the place, he would no doubt have been chased through the town

and stoned; and the time has been, and not many years ago, either, when a

Christian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if captured in a

mosque.  We caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated pavements within

and of the devotees performing their ablutions at the fountains, but even

that we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the Moorish

bystanders.



Some years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order.

The Moors of Tangier have so degenerated that it has been long since

there was an artificer among them capable of curing so delicate a patient

as a debilitated clock.  The great men of the city met in solemn conclave

to consider how the difficulty was to be met.  They discussed the matter

thoroughly but arrived at no solution.  Finally, a patriarch arose and

said:



"Oh, children of the Prophet, it is known unto you that a Portuguee dog

of a Christian clock mender pollutes the city of Tangier with his

presence.  Ye know, also, that when mosques are builded, asses bear the

stones and the cement, and cross the sacred threshold.  Now, therefore,

send the Christian dog on all fours, and barefoot, into the holy place to

mend the clock, and let him go as an ass!"



And in that way it was done.  Therefore, if Blucher ever sees the inside

of a mosque, he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in his

natural character.  We visited the jail and found Moorish prisoners

making mats and baskets.  (This thing of utilizing crime savors of

civilization.)  Murder is punished with death.  A short time ago three

murderers were taken beyond the city walls and shot.  Moorish guns are

not good, and neither are Moorish marksmen.  In this instance they set up

the poor criminals at long range, like so many targets, and practiced on

them--kept them hopping about and dodging bullets for half an hour before

they managed to drive the center.



When a man steals cattle, they cut off his right hand and left leg and

nail them up in the marketplace as a warning to everybody.  Their surgery

is not artistic.  They slice around the bone a little, then break off the

limb.  Sometimes the patient gets well; but, as a general thing, he

don't.  However, the Moorish heart is stout.  The Moors were always

brave.  These criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince,

without a tremor of any kind, without a groan!  No amount of suffering

can bring down the pride of a Moor or make him shame his dignity with a

cry.



Here, marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it.  There

are no valentines, no stolen interviews, no riding out, no courting in

dim parlors, no lovers' quarrels and reconciliations--no nothing that is

proper to approaching matrimony.  The young man takes the girl his father

selects for him, marries her, and after that she is unveiled, and he sees

her for the first time.  If after due acquaintance she suits him, he

retains her; but if he suspects her purity, he bundles her back to her

father; if he finds her diseased, the same; or if, after just and

reasonable time is allowed her, she neglects to bear children, back she

goes to the home of her childhood.



Muhammadans here who can afford it keep a good many wives on hand.  They

are called wives, though I believe the Koran only allows four genuine

wives--the rest are concubines.  The Emperor of Morocco don't know how

many wives he has, but thinks he has five hundred.  However, that is near

enough--a dozen or so, one way or the other, don't matter.



Even the Jews in the interior have a plurality of wives.



I have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish women (for they

are only human, and will expose their faces for the admiration of a

Christian dog when no male Moor is by), and I am full of veneration for

the wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness.



They carry their children at their backs, in a sack, like other savages

the world over.



Many of the Negroes are held in slavery by the Moors.  But the moment a

female slave becomes her master's concubine her bonds are broken, and as

soon as a male slave can read the first chapter of the Koran (which

contains the creed) he can no longer be held in bondage.



They have three Sundays a week in Tangier.  The Muhammadans' comes on

Friday, the Jews' on Saturday, and that of the Christian Consuls on

Sunday.  The Jews are the most radical.  The Moor goes to his mosque

about noon on his Sabbath, as on any other day, removes his shoes at the

door, performs his ablutions, makes his salaams, pressing his forehead to

the pavement time and again, says his prayers, and goes back to his work.



But the Jew shuts up shop; will not touch copper or bronze money at all;

soils his fingers with nothing meaner than silver and gold; attends the

synagogue devoutly; will not cook or have anything to do with fire; and

religiously refrains from embarking in any enterprise.



The Moor who has made a pilgrimage to Mecca is entitled to high

distinction.  Men call him Hadji, and he is thenceforward a great

personage.  Hundreds of Moors come to Tangier every year and embark for

Mecca.  They go part of the way in English steamers, and the ten or

twelve dollars they pay for passage is about all the trip costs.  They

take with them a quantity of food, and when the commissary department

fails they "skirmish," as Jack terms it in his sinful, slangy way.  From

the time they leave till they get home again, they never wash, either on

land or sea.  They are usually gone from five to seven months, and as

they do not change their clothes during all that time, they are totally

unfit for the drawing room when they get back.



Many of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather together the

ten dollars their steamer passage costs, and when one of them gets back

he is a bankrupt forever after.  Few Moors can ever build up their

fortunes again in one short lifetime after so reckless an outlay.  In

order to confine the dignity of Hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood and

possessions, the Emperor decreed that no man should make the pilgrimage

save bloated aristocrats who were worth a hundred dollars in specie.  But

behold how iniquity can circumvent the law!  For a consideration, the

Jewish money-changer lends the pilgrim one hundred dollars long enough

for him to swear himself through, and then receives it back before the

ship sails out of the harbor!



Spain is the only nation the Moors fear.  The reason is that Spain sends

her heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these Muslims,

while America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a

gunboat occasionally.  The Moors, like other savages, learn by what they

see, not what they hear or read.  We have great fleets in the

Mediterranean, but they seldom touch at African ports.  The Moors have a

small opinion of England, France, and America, and put their

representatives to a deal of red-tape circumlocution before they grant

them their common rights, let alone a favor.  But the moment the Spanish

minister makes a demand, it is acceded to at once, whether it be just or

not.



Spain chastised the Moors five or six years ago, about a disputed piece

of property opposite Gibraltar, and captured the city of Tetouan.  She

compromised on an augmentation of her territory, twenty million dollars'

indemnity in money, and peace.  And then she gave up the city.  But she

never gave it up until the Spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats.

They would not compromise as long as the cats held out.  Spaniards are

very fond of cats.  On the contrary, the Moors reverence cats as

something sacred.  So the Spaniards touched them on a tender point that

time.  Their unfeline conduct in eating up all the Tetouan cats aroused a

hatred toward them in the breasts of the Moors, to which even the driving

them out of Spain was tame and passionless.  Moors and Spaniards are foes

forever now.  France had a minister here once who embittered the nation

against him in the most innocent way.  He killed a couple of battalions

of cats (Tangier is full of them) and made a parlor carpet out of their

hides.  He made his carpet in circles--first a circle of old gray

tomcats, with their tails all pointing toward the center; then a circle

of yellow cats; next a circle of black cats and a circle of white ones;

then a circle of all sorts of cats; and, finally, a centerpiece of

assorted kittens.  It was very beautiful, but the Moors curse his memory

to this day.



When we went to call on our American Consul General today I noticed that

all possible games for parlor amusement seemed to be represented on his

center tables.  I thought that hinted at lonesomeness.  The idea was

correct.  His is the only American family in Tangier.  There are many

foreign consuls in this place, but much visiting is not indulged in.

Tangier is clear out of the world, and what is the use of visiting when

people have nothing on earth to talk about?  There is none.  So each

consul's family stays at home chiefly and amuses itself as best it can.

Tangier is full of interest for one day, but after that it is a weary

prison.  The Consul General has been here five years, and has got enough

of it to do him for a century, and is going home shortly.  His family

seize upon their letters and papers when the mail arrives, read them over

and over again for two days or three, talk them over and over again for

two or three more till they wear them out, and after that for days

together they eat and drink and sleep, and ride out over the same old

road, and see the same old tiresome things that even decades of centuries

have scarcely changed, and say never a single word!  They have literally

nothing whatever to talk about.  The arrival of an American man-of-war is

a godsend to them.  "O Solitude, where are the charms which sages have

seen in thy face?"  It is the completest exile that I can conceive of.

I would seriously recommend to the government of the United States that

when a man commits a crime so heinous that the law provides no adequate

punishment for it, they make him Consul General to Tangier.



I am glad to have seen Tangier--the second-oldest town in the world.  But

I am ready to bid it good-bye, I believe.



We shall go hence to Gibraltar this evening or in the morning, and

doubtless the Quaker City will sail from that port within the next forty-

eight hours.









CHAPTER X.



We passed the Fourth of July on board the Quaker City, in mid-ocean.  It

was in all respects a characteristic Mediterranean day--faultlessly

beautiful.  A cloudless sky; a refreshing summer wind; a radiant sunshine

that glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested mountains

of water; a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue, so richly,

brilliantly blue, that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with the

spell of its fascination.



They even have fine sunsets on the Mediterranean--a thing that is

certainly rare in most quarters of the globe.  The evening we sailed away

from Gibraltar, that hard-featured rock was swimming in a creamy mist so

rich, so soft, so enchantingly vague and dreamy, that even the Oracle,

that serene, that inspired, that overpowering humbug, scorned the dinner

gong and tarried to worship!



He said: "Well, that's gorgis, ain't it!  They don't have none of them

things in our parts, do they?  I consider that them effects is on account

of the superior refragability, as you may say, of the sun's diramic

combination with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of Jubiter.  What

should you think?"



"Oh, go to bed!" Dan said that, and went away.



"Oh, yes, it's all very well to say go to bed when a man makes an

argument which another man can't answer.  Dan don't never stand any

chance in an argument with me.  And he knows it, too.  What should you

say, Jack?"



"Now, Doctor, don't you come bothering around me with that dictionary

bosh.  I don't do you any harm, do I?  Then you let me alone."



"He's gone, too.  Well, them fellows have all tackled the old Oracle, as

they say, but the old man's most too many for 'em.  Maybe the Poet Lariat

ain't satisfied with them deductions?"



The poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below.



"'Pears that he can't qualify, neither.  Well, I didn't expect nothing

out of him.  I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything.

He'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush

about that old rock and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger, or

anybody he comes across first which he can impose on.  Pity but

somebody'd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out

of him.  Why can't a man put his intellect onto things that's some value?

Gibbons, and Hippocratus, and Sarcophagus, and all them old ancient

philosophers was down on poets--"



"Doctor," I said, "you are going to invent authorities now and I'll leave

you, too.  I always enjoy your conversation, notwithstanding the

luxuriance of your syllables, when the philosophy you offer rests on your

own responsibility; but when you begin to soar--when you begin to support

it with the evidence of authorities who are the creations of your own

fancy--I lose confidence."



That was the way to flatter the doctor.  He considered it a sort of

acknowledgment on my part of a fear to argue with him.  He was always

persecuting the passengers with abstruse propositions framed in language

that no man could understand, and they endured the exquisite torture a

minute or two and then abandoned the field.  A triumph like this, over

half a dozen antagonists was sufficient for one day; from that time

forward he would patrol the decks beaming blandly upon all comers, and so

tranquilly, blissfully happy!



But I digress.  The thunder of our two brave cannon announced the Fourth

of July, at daylight, to all who were awake.  But many of us got our

information at a later hour, from the almanac.  All the flags were sent

aloft except half a dozen that were needed to decorate portions of the

ship below, and in a short time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance.

During the morning, meetings were held and all manner of committees set

to work on the celebration ceremonies.  In the afternoon the ship's

company assembled aft, on deck, under the awnings; the flute, the

asthmatic melodeon, and the consumptive clarinet crippled "The Star-

Spangled Banner," the choir chased it to cover, and George came in with a

peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note and slaughtered it.

Nobody mourned.



We carried out the corpse on three cheers (that joke was not intentional

and I do not endorse it), and then the President, throned behind a cable

locker with a national flag spread over it, announced the "Reader," who

rose up and read that same old Declaration of Independence which we have

all listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said;

and after that the President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters and

he made that same old speech about our national greatness which we so

religiously believe and so fervently applaud.  Now came the choir into

court again, with the complaining instruments, and assaulted "Hail

Columbia"; and when victory hung wavering in the scale, George returned

with his dreadful wild-goose stop turned on and the choir won, of course.

A minister pronounced the benediction, and the patriotic little gathering

disbanded.  The Fourth of July was safe, as far as the Mediterranean was

concerned.



At dinner in the evening, a well-written original poem was recited with

spirit by one of the ship's captains, and thirteen regular toasts were

washed down with several baskets of champagne.  The speeches were bad--

execrable almost without exception.  In fact, without any exception but

one.  Captain Duncan made a good speech; he made the only good speech of

the evening.  He said:



"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--May we all live to a green old age and be

prosperous and happy.  Steward, bring up another basket of champagne."



It was regarded as a very able effort.



The festivities, so to speak, closed with another of those miraculous

balls on the promenade deck.  We were not used to dancing on an even

keel, though, and it was only a questionable success.  But take it all

together, it was a bright, cheerful, pleasant Fourth.



Toward nightfall the next evening, we steamed into the great artificial

harbor of this noble city of Marseilles, and saw the dying sunlight gild

its clustering spires and ramparts, and flood its leagues of environing

verdure with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the white

villas that flecked the landscape far and near.  [Copyright secured

according to law.]



There were no stages out, and we could not get on the pier from the ship.

It was annoying.  We were full of enthusiasm--we wanted to see France!

Just at nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for the

privilege of using his boat as a bridge--its stern was at our companion

ladder and its bow touched the pier.  We got in and the fellow backed out

into the harbor.  I told him in French that all we wanted was to walk

over his thwarts and step ashore, and asked him what he went away out

there for.  He said he could not understand me.  I repeated.  Still he

could not understand.  He appeared to be very ignorant of French.  The

doctor tried him, but he could not understand the doctor.  I asked this

boatman to explain his conduct, which he did; and then I couldn't

understand him.  Dan said:



"Oh, go to the pier, you old fool--that's where we want to go!"



We reasoned calmly with Dan that it was useless to speak to this

foreigner in English--that he had better let us conduct this business in

the French language and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was.



"Well, go on, go on," he said, "don't mind me.  I don't wish to

interfere.  Only, if you go on telling him in your kind of French, he

never will find out where we want to go to.  That is what I think about

it."



We rebuked him severely for this remark and said we never knew an

ignorant person yet but was prejudiced.  The Frenchman spoke again, and

the doctor said:



"There now, Dan, he says he is going to allez to the douain.  Means he is

going to the hotel.  Oh, certainly--we don't know the French language."



This was a crusher, as Jack would say.  It silenced further criticism

from the disaffected member.  We coasted past the sharp bows of a navy of

great steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone

pier.  It was easy to remember then that the douain was the customhouse

and not the hotel.  We did not mention it, however.  With winning French

politeness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels, declined

to examine our passports, and sent us on our way.  We stopped at the

first cafe we came to and entered.  An old woman seated us at a table and

waited for orders.  The doctor said:



"Avez-vous du vin?"



The dame looked perplexed.  The doctor said again, with elaborate

distinctness of articulation:



"Avez-vous du--vin!"



The dame looked more perplexed than before.  I said:



"Doctor, there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere.  Let me try

her.  Madame, avez-vous du vin?--It isn't any use, Doctor--take the

witness."



"Madame, avez-vous du vin--du fromage--pain--pickled pigs' feet--beurre--

des oeufs--du boeuf--horseradish, sauerkraut, hog and hominy--anything,

anything in the world that can stay a Christian stomach!"



She said:



"Bless you, why didn't you speak English before?  I don't know anything

about your plagued French!"



The humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled the supper, and

we dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could.  Here

we were in beautiful France--in a vast stone house of quaint

architecture--surrounded by all manner of curiously worded French signs--

stared at by strangely habited, bearded French people--everything

gradually and surely forcing upon us the coveted consciousness that at

last, and beyond all question, we were in beautiful France and absorbing

its nature to the forgetfulness of everything else, and coming to feel

the happy romance of the thing in all its enchanting delightfulness--and

to think of this skinny veteran intruding with her vile English, at such

a moment, to blow the fair vision to the winds!  It was exasperating.



We set out to find the centre of the city, inquiring the direction every

now and then.  We never did succeed in making anybody understand just

exactly what we wanted, and neither did we ever succeed in comprehending

just exactly what they said in reply, but then they always pointed--they

always did that--and we bowed politely and said, "Merci, monsieur," and

so it was a blighting triumph over the disaffected member anyway.  He was

restive under these victories and often asked:



"What did that pirate say?"



"Why, he told us which way to go to find the Grand Casino."



"Yes, but what did he say?"



"Oh, it don't matter what he said--we understood him.  These are educated

people--not like that absurd boatman."



"Well, I wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction that

goes some where--for we've been going around in a circle for an hour.

I've passed this same old drugstore seven times."



We said it was a low, disreputable falsehood (but we knew it was not).

It was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again, though--

we might go on asking directions, but we must cease from following

finger-pointings if we hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffected

member.



A long walk through smooth, asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks of

vast new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and every

block precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for a

mile, and all brilliantly lighted--brought us at last to the principal

thoroughfare.  On every hand were bright colors, flashing constellations

of gas burners, gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks--

hurry, life, activity, cheerfulness, conversation, and laughter

everywhere!  We found the Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix, and wrote

down who we were, where we were born, what our occupations were, the

place we came from last, whether we were married or single, how we liked

it, how old we were, where we were bound for and when we expected to get

there, and a great deal of information of similar importance--all for the

benefit of the landlord and the secret police.  We hired a guide and

began the business of sightseeing immediately.  That first night on

French soil was a stirring one.  I cannot think of half the places we

went to or what we particularly saw; we had no disposition to examine

carefully into anything at all--we only wanted to glance and go--to move,

keep moving!  The spirit of the country was upon us.  We sat down,

finally, at a late hour, in the great Casino, and called for unstinted

champagne.  It is so easy to be bloated aristocrats where it costs

nothing of consequence!  There were about five hundred people in that

dazzling place, I suppose, though the walls being papered entirely with

mirrors, so to speak, one could not really tell but that there were a

hundred thousand.  Young, daintily dressed exquisites and young,

stylishly dressed women, and also old gentlemen and old ladies, sat in

couples and groups about innumerable marble-topped tables and ate fancy

suppers, drank wine, and kept up a chattering din of conversation that

was dazing to the senses.  There was a stage at the far end and a large

orchestra; and every now and then actors and actresses in preposterous

comic dresses came out and sang the most extravagantly funny songs, to

judge by their absurd actions; but that audience merely suspended its

chatter, stared cynically, and never once smiled, never once applauded!

I had always thought that Frenchmen were ready to laugh at any thing.









CHAPTER XI.



We are getting foreignized rapidly and with facility.  We are getting

reconciled to halls and bedchambers with unhomelike stone floors and no

carpets--floors that ring to the tread of one's heels with a sharpness

that is death to sentimental musing.  We are getting used to tidy,

noiseless waiters, who glide hither and thither, and hover about your

back and your elbows like butterflies, quick to comprehend orders, quick

to fill them; thankful for a gratuity without regard to the amount; and

always polite--never otherwise than polite.  That is the strangest

curiosity yet--a really polite hotel waiter who isn't an idiot.  We are

getting used to driving right into the central court of the hotel, in the

midst of a fragrant circle of vines and flowers, and in the midst also of

parties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading the paper and smoking.  We

are getting used to ice frozen by artificial process in ordinary bottles

--the only kind of ice they have here.  We are getting used to all these

things, but we are not getting used to carrying our own soap.  We are

sufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes, but this

thing of having to ring for soap every time we wash is new to us and not

pleasant at all.  We think of it just after we get our heads and faces

thoroughly wet or just when we think we have been in the bathtub long

enough, and then, of course, an annoying delay follows.  These

Marseillaises make Marseillaise hymns and Marseilles vests and Marseilles

soap for all the world, but they never sing their hymns or wear their

vests or wash with their soap themselves.



We have learned to go through the lingering routine of the table d'hote

with patience, with serenity, with satisfaction.  We take soup, then wait

a few minutes for the fish; a few minutes more and the plates are

changed, and the roast beef comes; another change and we take peas;

change again and take lentils; change and take snail patties (I prefer

grasshoppers); change and take roast chicken and salad; then strawberry

pie and ice cream; then green figs, pears, oranges, green almonds, etc.;

finally coffee.  Wine with every course, of course, being in France.

With such a cargo on board, digestion is a slow process, and we must sit

long in the cool chambers and smoke--and read French newspapers, which

have a strange fashion of telling a perfectly straight story till you get

to the "nub" of it, and then a word drops in that no man can translate,

and that story is ruined.  An embankment fell on some Frenchmen

yesterday, and the papers are full of it today--but whether those

sufferers were killed, or crippled, or bruised, or only scared is more

than I can possibly make out, and yet I would just give anything to know.



We were troubled a little at dinner today by the conduct of an American,

who talked very loudly and coarsely and laughed boisterously where all

others were so quiet and well behaved.  He ordered wine with a royal

flourish and said:



"I never dine without wine, sir" (which was a pitiful falsehood), and

looked around upon the company to bask in the admiration he expected to

find in their faces.  All these airs in a land where they would as soon

expect to leave the soup out of the bill of fare as the wine!--in a land

where wine is nearly as common among all ranks as water!  This fellow

said: "I am a free-born sovereign, sir, an American, sir, and I want

everybody to know it!"  He did not mention that he was a lineal

descendant of Balaam's ass, but everybody knew that without his telling

it.



We have driven in the Prado--that superb avenue bordered with patrician

mansions and noble shade trees--and have visited the chateau Boarely and

its curious museum.  They showed us a miniature cemetery there--a copy of

the first graveyard that was ever in Marseilles, no doubt.  The delicate

little skeletons were lying in broken vaults and had their household gods

and kitchen utensils with them.  The original of this cemetery was dug up

in the principal street of the city a few years ago.  It had remained

there, only twelve feet underground, for a matter of twenty-five hundred

years or thereabouts.  Romulus was here before he built Rome, and thought

something of founding a city on this spot, but gave up the idea.  He may

have been personally acquainted with some of these Phoenicians whose

skeletons we have been examining.



In the great Zoological Gardens we found specimens of all the animals the

world produces, I think, including a dromedary, a monkey ornamented with

tufts of brilliant blue and carmine hair--a very gorgeous monkey he was--

a hippopotamus from the Nile, and a sort of tall, long-legged bird with a

beak like a powder horn and close-fitting wings like the tails of a dress

coat.  This fellow stood up with his eyes shut and his shoulders stooped

forward a little, and looked as if he had his hands under his coat tails.

Such tranquil stupidity, such supernatural gravity, such self-

righteousness, and such ineffable self-complacency as were in the

countenance and attitude of that gray-bodied, dark-winged, bald-headed,

and preposterously uncomely bird!  He was so ungainly, so pimply about

the head, so scaly about the legs, yet so serene, so unspeakably

satisfied!  He was the most comical-looking creature that can be

imagined.  It was good to hear Dan and the doctor laugh--such natural and

such enjoyable laughter had not been heard among our excursionists since

our ship sailed away from America.  This bird was a godsend to us, and I

should be an ingrate if I forgot to make honorable mention of him in

these pages.  Ours was a pleasure excursion; therefore we stayed with

that bird an hour and made the most of him.  We stirred him up

occasionally, but he only unclosed an eye and slowly closed it again,

abating no jot of his stately piety of demeanor or his tremendous

seriousness.  He only seemed to say, "Defile not Heaven's anointed with

unsanctified hands."  We did not know his name, and so we called him "The

Pilgrim."  Dan said:



"All he wants now is a Plymouth Collection."



The boon companion of the colossal elephant was a common cat!  This cat

had a fashion of climbing up the elephant's hind legs and roosting on his

back.  She would sit up there, with her paws curved under her breast, and

sleep in the sun half the afternoon.  It used to annoy the elephant at

first, and he would reach up and take her down, but she would go aft and

climb up again.  She persisted until she finally conquered the elephant's

prejudices, and now they are inseparable friends.  The cat plays about

her comrade's forefeet or his trunk often, until dogs approach, and then

she goes aloft out of danger.  The elephant has annihilated several dogs

lately that pressed his companion too closely.



We hired a sailboat and a guide and made an excursion to one of the small

islands in the harbor to visit the Castle d'If.  This ancient fortress

has a melancholy history.  It has been used as a prison for political

offenders for two or three hundred years, and its dungeon walls are

scarred with the rudely carved names of many and many a captive who

fretted his life away here and left no record of himself but these sad

epitaphs wrought with his own hands.  How thick the names were!  And

their long-departed owners seemed to throng the gloomy cells and

corridors with their phantom shapes.  We loitered through dungeon after

dungeon, away down into the living rock below the level of the sea, it

seemed.  Names everywhere!--some plebeian, some noble, some even

princely.  Plebeian, prince, and noble had one solicitude in common--they

would not be forgotten!  They could suffer solitude, inactivity, and the

horrors of a silence that no sound ever disturbed, but they could not

bear the thought of being utterly forgotten by the world.  Hence the

carved names.  In one cell, where a little light penetrated, a man had

lived twenty-seven years without seeing the face of a human being--lived

in filth and wretchedness, with no companionship but his own thoughts,

and they were sorrowful enough and hopeless enough, no doubt.  Whatever

his jailers considered that he needed was conveyed to his cell by night

through a wicket.



This man carved the walls of his prison house from floor to roof with all

manner of figures of men and animals grouped in intricate designs.  He

had toiled there year after year, at his self-appointed task, while

infants grew to boyhood--to vigorous youth--idled through school and

college--acquired a profession--claimed man's mature estate--married and

looked back to infancy as to a thing of some vague, ancient time, almost.

But who shall tell how many ages it seemed to this prisoner?  With the

one, time flew sometimes; with the other, never--it crawled always.  To

the one, nights spent in dancing had seemed made of minutes instead of

hours; to the other, those selfsame nights had been like all other nights

of dungeon life and seemed made of slow, dragging weeks instead of hours

and minutes.



One prisoner of fifteen years had scratched verses upon his walls, and

brief prose sentences--brief, but full of pathos.  These spoke not of

himself and his hard estate, but only of the shrine where his spirit fled

the prison to worship--of home and the idols that were templed there.

He never lived to see them.



The walls of these dungeons are as thick as some bed-chambers at home are

wide--fifteen feet.  We saw the damp, dismal cells in which two of Dumas'

heroes passed their confinement--heroes of "Monte Cristo."  It was here

that the brave Abbe wrote a book with his own blood, with a pen made of a

piece of iron hoop, and by the light of a lamp made out of shreds of

cloth soaked in grease obtained from his food; and then dug through the

thick wall with some trifling instrument which he wrought himself out of

a stray piece of iron or table cutlery and freed Dantes from his chains.

It was a pity that so many weeks of dreary labor should have come to

naught at last.



They showed us the noisome cell where the celebrated "Iron Mask"--that

ill-starred brother of a hardhearted king of France--was confined for a

season before he was sent to hide the strange mystery of his life from

the curious in the dungeons of Ste. Marguerite.  The place had a far

greater interest for us than it could have had if we had known beyond all

question who the Iron Mask was, and what his history had been, and why

this most unusual punishment had been meted out to him.  Mystery!  That

was the charm.  That speechless tongue, those prisoned features, that

heart so freighted with unspoken troubles, and that breast so oppressed

with its piteous secret had been here.  These dank walls had known the

man whose dolorous story is a sealed book forever!  There was fascination

in the spot.









CHAPTER XII.



We have come five hundred miles by rail through the heart of France.

What a bewitching land it is!  What a garden!  Surely the leagues of

bright green lawns are swept and brushed and watered every day and their

grasses trimmed by the barber.  Surely the hedges are shaped and measured

and their symmetry preserved by the most architectural of gardeners.

Surely the long straight rows of stately poplars that divide the

beautiful landscape like the squares of a checker-board are set with line

and plummet, and their uniform height determined with a spirit level.

Surely the straight, smooth, pure white turnpikes are jack-planed and

sandpapered every day.  How else are these marvels of symmetry,

cleanliness, and order attained?  It is wonderful.  There are no

unsightly stone walls and never a fence of any kind.  There is no dirt,

no decay, no rubbish anywhere--nothing that even hints at untidiness--

nothing that ever suggests neglect.  All is orderly and beautiful--every

thing is charming to the eye.



We had such glimpses of the Rhone gliding along between its grassy banks;

of cosy cottages buried in flowers and shrubbery; of quaint old red-tiled

villages with mossy medieval cathedrals looming out of their midst; of

wooded hills with ivy-grown towers and turrets of feudal castles

projecting above the foliage; such glimpses of Paradise, it seemed to us,

such visions of fabled fairyland!



We knew then what the poet meant when he sang of:  "--thy cornfields

green, and sunny vines,  O pleasant land of France!"



And it is a pleasant land.  No word describes it so felicitously as that

one.  They say there is no word for "home" in the French language.  Well,

considering that they have the article itself in such an attractive

aspect, they ought to manage to get along without the word.  Let us not

waste too much pity on "homeless" France.  I have observed that Frenchmen

abroad seldom wholly give up the idea of going back to France some time

or other.  I am not surprised at it now.



We are not infatuated with these French railway cars, though.  We took

first-class passage, not because we wished to attract attention by doing

a thing which is uncommon in Europe but because we could make our journey

quicker by so doing.  It is hard to make railroading pleasant in any

country.  It is too tedious.  Stagecoaching is infinitely more

delightful.  Once I crossed the plains and deserts and mountains of the

West in a stagecoach, from the Missouri line to California, and since

then all my pleasure trips must be measured to that rare holiday frolic.

Two thousand miles of ceaseless rush and rattle and clatter, by night and

by day, and never a weary moment, never a lapse of interest!  The first

seven hundred miles a level continent, its grassy carpet greener and

softer and smoother than any sea and figured with designs fitted to its

magnitude--the shadows of the clouds.  Here were no scenes but summer

scenes, and no disposition inspired by them but to lie at full length on

the mail sacks in the grateful breeze and dreamily smoke the pipe of

peace--what other, where all was repose and contentment?  In cool

mornings, before the sun was fairly up, it was worth a lifetime of city

toiling and moiling to perch in the foretop with the driver and see the

six mustangs scamper under the sharp snapping of the whip that never

touched them; to scan the blue distances of a world that knew no lords

but us; to cleave the wind with uncovered head and feel the sluggish

pulses rousing to the spirit of a speed that pretended to the resistless

rush of a typhoon!  Then thirteen hundred miles of desert solitudes; of

limitless panoramas of bewildering perspective; of mimic cities, of

pinnacled cathedrals, of massive fortresses, counterfeited in the eternal

rocks and splendid with the crimson and gold of the setting sun; of dizzy

altitudes among fog-wreathed peaks and never-melting snows, where

thunders and lightnings and tempests warred magnificently at our feet and

the storm clouds above swung their shredded banners in our very faces!

But I forgot.  I am in elegant France now, and not scurrying through the

great South Pass and the Wind River Mountains, among antelopes and

buffaloes and painted Indians on the warpath.  It is not meet that I

should make too disparaging comparisons between humdrum travel on a

railway and that royal summer flight across a continent in a stagecoach.

I meant in the beginning to say that railway journeying is tedious and

tiresome, and so it is--though at the time I was thinking particularly of

a dismal fifty-hour pilgrimage between New York and St. Louis.  Of course

our trip through France was not really tedious because all its scenes and

experiences were new and strange; but as Dan says, it had its

"discrepancies."



The cars are built in compartments that hold eight persons each.  Each

compartment is partially subdivided, and so there are two tolerably

distinct parties of four in it.  Four face the other four.  The seats and

backs are thickly padded and cushioned and are very comfortable; you can

smoke if you wish; there are no bothersome peddlers; you are saved the

infliction of a multitude of disagreeable fellow passengers.  So far, so

well.  But then the conductor locks you in when the train starts; there

is no water to drink in the car; there is no heating apparatus for night

travel; if a drunken rowdy should get in, you could not remove a matter

of twenty seats from him or enter another car; but above all, if you are

worn out and must sleep, you must sit up and do it in naps, with cramped

legs and in a torturing misery that leaves you withered and lifeless the

next day--for behold they have not that culmination of all charity and

human kindness, a sleeping car, in all France.  I prefer the American

system.  It has not so many grievous "discrepancies."



In France, all is clockwork, all is order.  They make no mistakes.  Every

third man wears a uniform, and whether he be a marshal of the empire or a

brakeman, he is ready and perfectly willing to answer all your questions

with tireless politeness, ready to tell you which car to take, yea, and

ready to go and put you into it to make sure that you shall not go

astray.  You cannot pass into the waiting room of the depot till you have

secured your ticket, and you cannot pass from its only exit till the

train is at its threshold to receive you.  Once on board, the train will

not start till your ticket has been examined--till every passenger's

ticket has been inspected.  This is chiefly for your own good.  If by any

possibility you have managed to take the wrong train, you will be handed

over to a polite official who will take you whither you belong and bestow

you with many an affable bow.  Your ticket will be inspected every now

and then along the route, and when it is time to change cars you will

know it.  You are in the hands of officials who zealously study your

welfare and your interest, instead of turning their talents to the

invention of new methods of discommoding and snubbing you, as is very

often the main employment of that exceedingly self-satisfied monarch, the

railroad conductor of America.



But the happiest regulation in French railway government is--thirty

minutes to dinner!  No five-minute boltings of flabby rolls, muddy

coffee, questionable eggs, gutta-percha beef, and pies whose conception

and execution are a dark and bloody mystery to all save the cook that

created them!  No, we sat calmly down--it was in old Dijon, which is so

easy to spell and so impossible to pronounce except when you civilize it

and call it Demijohn--and poured out rich Burgundian wines and munched

calmly through a long table d'hote bill of fare, snail patties, delicious

fruits and all, then paid the trifle it cost and stepped happily aboard

the train again, without once cursing the railroad company.  A rare

experience and one to be treasured forever.



They say they do not have accidents on these French roads, and I think it

must be true.  If I remember rightly, we passed high above wagon roads or

through tunnels under them, but never crossed them on their own level.

About every quarter of a mile, it seemed to me, a man came out and held

up a club till the train went by, to signify that everything was safe

ahead.  Switches were changed a mile in advance by pulling a wire rope

that passed along the ground by the rail, from station to station.

Signals for the day and signals for the night gave constant and timely

notice of the position of switches.



No, they have no railroad accidents to speak of in France.  But why?

Because when one occurs, somebody has to hang for it!  Not hang, maybe,

but be punished at least with such vigor of emphasis as to make

negligence a thing to be shuddered at by railroad officials for many a

day thereafter.  "No blame attached to the officers"--that lying and

disaster-breeding verdict so common to our softhearted juries is seldom

rendered in France.  If the trouble occurred in the conductor's

department, that officer must suffer if his subordinate cannot be proven

guilty; if in the engineer's department and the case be similar, the

engineer must answer.



The Old Travelers--those delightful parrots who have "been here before"

and know more about the country than Louis Napoleon knows now or ever

will know--tell us these things, and we believe them because they are

pleasant things to believe and because they are plausible and savor of

the rigid subjection to law and order which we behold about us

everywhere.



But we love the Old Travelers.  We love to hear them prate and drivel and

lie.  We can tell them the moment we see them.  They always throw out a

few feelers; they never cast themselves adrift till they have sounded

every individual and know that he has not traveled.  Then they open their

throttle valves, and how they do brag, and sneer, and swell, and soar,

and blaspheme the sacred name of Truth!  Their central idea, their grand

aim, is to subjugate you, keep you down, make you feel insignificant and

humble in the blaze of their cosmopolitan glory!  They will not let you

know anything.  They sneer at your most inoffensive suggestions; they

laugh unfeelingly at your treasured dreams of foreign lands; they brand

the statements of your traveled aunts and uncles as the stupidest

absurdities; they deride your most trusted authors and demolish the fair

images they have set up for your willing worship with the pitiless

ferocity of the fanatic iconoclast!  But still I love the Old Travelers.

I love them for their witless platitudes, for their supernatural ability

to bore, for their delightful asinine vanity, for their luxuriant

fertility of imagination, for their startling, their brilliant, their

overwhelming mendacity!



By Lyons and the Saone (where we saw the lady of Lyons and thought little

of her comeliness), by Villa Franca, Tonnere, venerable Sens, Melun,

Fontainebleau, and scores of other beautiful cities, we swept, always

noting the absence of hog-wallows, broken fences, cow lots, unpainted

houses, and mud, and always noting, as well, the presence of cleanliness,

grace, taste in adorning and beautifying, even to the disposition of a

tree or the turning of a hedge, the marvel of roads in perfect repair,

void of ruts and guiltless of even an inequality of surface--we bowled

along, hour after hour, that brilliant summer day, and as nightfall

approached we entered a wilderness of odorous flowers and shrubbery, sped

through it, and then, excited, delighted, and half persuaded that we were

only the sport of a beautiful dream, lo, we stood in magnificent Paris!



What excellent order they kept about that vast depot!  There was no

frantic crowding and jostling, no shouting and swearing, and no

swaggering intrusion of services by rowdy hackmen.  These latter gentry

stood outside--stood quietly by their long line of vehicles and said

never a word.  A kind of hackman general seemed to have the whole matter

of transportation in his hands.  He politely received the passengers and

ushered them to the kind of conveyance they wanted, and told the driver

where to deliver them.  There was no "talking back," no dissatisfaction

about overcharging, no grumbling about anything.  In a little while we

were speeding through the streets of Paris and delightfully recognizing

certain names and places with which books had long ago made us familiar.

It was like meeting an old friend when we read Rue de Rivoli on the

street corner; we knew the genuine vast palace of the Louvre as well as

we knew its picture; when we passed by the Column of July we needed no

one to tell us what it was or to remind us that on its site once stood

the grim Bastille, that grave of human hopes and happiness, that dismal

prison house within whose dungeons so many young faces put on the

wrinkles of age, so many proud spirits grew humble, so many brave hearts

broke.



We secured rooms at the hotel, or rather, we had three beds put into one

room, so that we might be together, and then we went out to a restaurant,

just after lamplighting, and ate a comfortable, satisfactory, lingering

dinner.  It was a pleasure to eat where everything was so tidy, the food

so well cooked, the waiters so polite, and the coming and departing

company so moustached, so frisky, so affable, so fearfully and

wonderfully Frenchy!  All the surroundings were gay and enlivening.  Two

hundred people sat at little tables on the sidewalk, sipping wine and

coffee; the streets were thronged with light vehicles and with joyous

pleasure-seekers; there was music in the air, life and action all about

us, and a conflagration of gaslight everywhere!



After dinner we felt like seeing such Parisian specialties as we might

see without distressing exertion, and so we sauntered through the

brilliant streets and looked at the dainty trifles in variety stores and

jewelry shops.  Occasionally, merely for the pleasure of being cruel, we

put unoffending Frenchmen on the rack with questions framed in the

incomprehensible jargon of their native language, and while they writhed

we impaled them, we peppered them, we scarified them, with their own vile

verbs and participles.



We noticed that in the jewelry stores they had some of the articles

marked "gold" and some labeled "imitation."  We wondered at this

extravagance of honesty and inquired into the matter.  We were informed

that inasmuch as most people are not able to tell false gold from the

genuine article, the government compels jewelers to have their gold work

assayed and stamped officially according to its fineness and their

imitation work duly labeled with the sign of its falsity.  They told us

the jewelers would not dare to violate this law, and that whatever a

stranger bought in one of their stores might be depended upon as being

strictly what it was represented to be.  Verily, a wonderful land is

France!



Then we hunted for a barber-shop.  From earliest infancy it had been a

cherished ambition of mine to be shaved some day in a palatial barber-

shop in Paris.  I wished to recline at full length in a cushioned invalid

chair, with pictures about me and sumptuous furniture; with frescoed

walls and gilded arches above me and vistas of Corinthian columns

stretching far before me; with perfumes of Araby to intoxicate my senses

and the slumbrous drone of distant noises to soothe me to sleep.  At the

end of an hour I would wake up regretfully and find my face as smooth and

as soft as an infant's.  Departing, I would lift my hands above that

barber's head and say, "Heaven bless you, my son!"



So we searched high and low, for a matter of two hours, but never a

barber-shop could we see.  We saw only wig-making establishments, with

shocks of dead and repulsive hair bound upon the heads of painted waxen

brigands who stared out from glass boxes upon the passer-by with their

stony eyes and scared him with the ghostly white of their countenances.

We shunned these signs for a time, but finally we concluded that the wig-

makers must of necessity be the barbers as well, since we could find no

single legitimate representative of the fraternity.  We entered and

asked, and found that it was even so.



I said I wanted to be shaved.  The barber inquired where my room was.  I

said never mind where my room was, I wanted to be shaved--there, on the

spot.  The doctor said he would be shaved also.  Then there was an

excitement among those two barbers!  There was a wild consultation, and

afterwards a hurrying to and fro and a feverish gathering up of razors

from obscure places and a ransacking for soap.  Next they took us into a

little mean, shabby back room; they got two ordinary sitting-room chairs

and placed us in them with our coats on.  My old, old dream of bliss

vanished into thin air!



I sat bolt upright, silent, sad, and solemn.  One of the wig-making

villains lathered my face for ten terrible minutes and finished by

plastering a mass of suds into my mouth.  I expelled the nasty stuff with

a strong English expletive and said, "Foreigner, beware!"  Then this

outlaw strapped his razor on his boot, hovered over me ominously for six

fearful seconds, and then swooped down upon me like the genius of

destruction.  The first rake of his razor loosened the very hide from my

face and lifted me out of the chair.  I stormed and raved, and the other

boys enjoyed it.  Their beards are not strong and thick.  Let us draw the

curtain over this harrowing scene.



Suffice it that I submitted and went through with the cruel infliction of

a shave by a French barber; tears of exquisite agony coursed down my

cheeks now and then, but I survived.  Then the incipient assassin held a

basin of water under my chin and slopped its contents over my face, and

into my bosom, and down the back of my neck, with a mean pretense of

washing away the soap and blood.  He dried my features with a towel and

was going to comb my hair, but I asked to be excused.  I said, with

withering irony, that it was sufficient to be skinned--I declined to be

scalped.



I went away from there with my handkerchief about my face, and never,

never, never desired to dream of palatial Parisian barber-shops anymore.

The truth is, as I believe I have since found out, that they have no

barber shops worthy of the name in Paris--and no barbers, either, for

that matter.  The impostor who does duty as a barber brings his pans and

napkins and implements of torture to your residence and deliberately

skins you in your private apartments.  Ah, I have suffered, suffered,

suffered, here in Paris, but never mind--the time is coming when I shall

have a dark and bloody revenge.  Someday a Parisian barber will come to

my room to skin me, and from that day forth that barber will never be

heard of more.



At eleven o'clock we alighted upon a sign which manifestly referred to

billiards.  Joy!  We had played billiards in the Azores with balls that

were not round and on an ancient table that was very little smoother than

a brick pavement--one of those wretched old things with dead cushions,

and with patches in the faded cloth and invisible obstructions that made

the balls describe the most astonishing and unsuspected angles and

perform feats in the way of unlooked-for and almost impossible

"scratches" that were perfectly bewildering.  We had played at Gibraltar

with balls the size of a walnut, on a table like a public square--and in

both instances we achieved far more aggravation than amusement.  We

expected to fare better here, but we were mistaken.  The cushions were a

good deal higher than the balls, and as the balls had a fashion of always

stopping under the cushions, we accomplished very little in the way of

caroms.  The cushions were hard and unelastic, and the cues were so

crooked that in making a shot you had to allow for the curve or you would

infallibly put the "English" on the wrong side of the hall.  Dan was to

mark while the doctor and I played.  At the end of an hour neither of us

had made a count, and so Dan was tired of keeping tally with nothing to

tally, and we were heated and angry and disgusted.  We paid the heavy

bill--about six cents--and said we would call around sometime when we had

a week to spend, and finish the game.



We adjourned to one of those pretty cafes and took supper and tested the

wines of the country, as we had been instructed to do, and found them

harmless and unexciting.  They might have been exciting, however, if we

had chosen to drink a sufficiency of them.



To close our first day in Paris cheerfully and pleasantly, we now sought

our grand room in the Grand Hotel du Louvre and climbed into our

sumptuous bed to read and smoke--but alas!



          It was pitiful,

          In a whole city-full,

          Gas we had none.



No gas to read by--nothing but dismal candles.  It was a shame.  We tried

to map out excursions for the morrow; we puzzled over French "guides to

Paris"; we talked disjointedly in a vain endeavor to make head or tail of

the wild chaos of the day's sights and experiences; we subsided to

indolent smoking; we gaped and yawned and stretched--then feebly wondered

if we were really and truly in renowned Paris, and drifted drowsily away

into that vast mysterious void which men call sleep.









CHAPTER XIII.



The next morning we were up and dressed at ten o'clock.  We went to the

'commissionaire' of the hotel--I don't know what a 'commissionaire' is,

but that is the man we went to--and told him we wanted a guide.  He said

the national Exposition had drawn such multitudes of Englishmen and

Americans to Paris that it would be next to impossible to find a good

guide unemployed.  He said he usually kept a dozen or two on hand, but he

only had three now.  He called them.  One looked so like a very pirate

that we let him go at once.  The next one spoke with a simpering

precision of pronunciation that was irritating and said:



"If ze zhentlemans will to me make ze grande honneur to me rattain in

hees serveece, I shall show to him every sing zat is magnifique to look

upon in ze beautiful Parree.  I speaky ze Angleesh pairfaitemaw."



He would have done well to have stopped there, because he had that much

by heart and said it right off without making a mistake.  But his self-

complacency seduced him into attempting a flight into regions of

unexplored English, and the reckless experiment was his ruin.  Within ten

seconds he was so tangled up in a maze of mutilated verbs and torn and

bleeding forms of speech that no human ingenuity could ever have gotten

him out of it with credit.  It was plain enough that he could not

"speaky" the English quite as "pairfaitemaw" as he had pretended he

could.



The third man captured us.  He was plainly dressed, but he had a

noticeable air of neatness about him.  He wore a high silk hat which was

a little old, but had been carefully brushed.  He wore second-hand kid

gloves, in good repair, and carried a small rattan cane with a curved

handle--a female leg--of ivory.  He stepped as gently and as daintily as

a cat crossing a muddy street; and oh, he was urbanity; he was quiet,

unobtrusive self-possession; he was deference itself!  He spoke softly

and guardedly; and when he was about to make a statement on his sole

responsibility or offer a suggestion, he weighed it by drachms and

scruples first, with the crook of his little stick placed meditatively to

his teeth.  His opening speech was perfect.  It was perfect in

construction, in phraseology, in grammar, in emphasis, in pronunciation--

everything.  He spoke little and guardedly after that.  We were charmed.

We were more than charmed--we were overjoyed.  We hired him at once.  We

never even asked him his price.  This man--our lackey, our servant, our

unquestioning slave though he was--was still a gentleman--we could see

that--while of the other two one was coarse and awkward and the other was

a born pirate.  We asked our man Friday's name.  He drew from his

pocketbook a snowy little card and passed it to us with a profound bow:



                             A. BILLFINGER,

                    Guide to Paris, France, Germany,

                            Spain, &c., &c.

                       Grande Hotel du Louvre.



"Billfinger!  Oh, carry me home to die!"



That was an "aside" from Dan.  The atrocious name grated harshly on my

ear, too.  The most of us can learn to forgive, and even to like, a

countenance that strikes us unpleasantly at first, but few of us, I

fancy, become reconciled to a jarring name so easily.  I was almost sorry

we had hired this man, his name was so unbearable.  However, no matter.

We were impatient to start.  Billfinger stepped to the door to call a

carriage, and then the doctor said:



"Well, the guide goes with the barbershop, with the billiard-table, with

the gasless room, and may be with many another pretty romance of Paris.

I expected to have a guide named Henri de Montmorency, or Armand de la

Chartreuse, or something that would sound grand in letters to the

villagers at home, but to think of a Frenchman by the name of Billfinger!

Oh!  This is absurd, you know.  This will never do.  We can't say

Billfinger; it is nauseating.  Name him over again; what had we better

call him?  Alexis du Caulaincourt?"



"Alphonse Henri Gustave de Hauteville," I suggested.



"Call him Ferguson," said Dan.



That was practical, unromantic good sense.  Without debate, we expunged

Billfinger as Billfinger, and called him Ferguson.



The carriage--an open barouche--was ready.  Ferguson mounted beside the

driver, and we whirled away to breakfast.  As was proper, Mr. Ferguson

stood by to transmit our orders and answer questions.  By and by, he

mentioned casually--the artful adventurer--that he would go and get his

breakfast as soon as we had finished ours.  He knew we could not get

along without him and that we would not want to loiter about and wait for

him.  We asked him to sit down and eat with us.  He begged, with many a

bow, to be excused.  It was not proper, he said; he would sit at another

table.  We ordered him peremptorily to sit down with us.



Here endeth the first lesson.  It was a mistake.



As long as we had that fellow after that, he was always hungry; he was

always thirsty.  He came early; he stayed late; he could not pass a

restaurant; he looked with a lecherous eye upon every wine shop.

Suggestions to stop, excuses to eat and to drink, were forever on his

lips.  We tried all we could to fill him so full that he would have no

room to spare for a fortnight, but it was a failure.  He did not hold

enough to smother the cravings of his superhuman appetite.



He had another "discrepancy" about him.  He was always wanting us to buy

things.  On the shallowest pretenses he would inveigle us into shirt

stores, boot stores, tailor shops, glove shops--anywhere under the broad

sweep of the heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything.

Anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage on

the sales, but in our blessed innocence we didn't until this feature of

his conduct grew unbearably prominent.  One day Dan happened to mention

that he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents.

Ferguson's hungry eye was upon him in an instant.  In the course of

twenty minutes the carriage stopped.



"What's this?"



"Zis is ze finest silk magazin in Paris--ze most celebrate."



"What did you come here for?  We told you to take us to the palace of the

Louvre."



"I suppose ze gentleman say he wish to buy some silk."



"You are not required to 'suppose' things for the party, Ferguson.  We do

not wish to tax your energies too much.  We will bear some of the burden

and heat of the day ourselves.  We will endeavor to do such 'supposing'

as is really necessary to be done.  Drive on."  So spake the doctor.



Within fifteen minutes the carriage halted again, and before another silk

store.  The doctor said:



"Ah, the palace of the Louvre--beautiful, beautiful edifice!  Does the

Emperor Napoleon live here now, Ferguson?"



"Ah, Doctor!  You do jest; zis is not ze palace; we come there directly.

But since we pass right by zis store, where is such beautiful silk--"



"Ah!  I see, I see.  I meant to have told you that we did not wish to

purchase any silks to-day, but in my absent-mindedness I forgot it.  I

also meant to tell you we wished to go directly to the Louvre, but I

forgot that also.  However, we will go there now.  Pardon my seeming

carelessness, Ferguson.  Drive on."



Within the half hour we stopped again--in front of another silk store.

We were angry; but the doctor was always serene, always smooth-voiced.

He said:



"At last!  How imposing the Louvre is, and yet how small!  How

exquisitely fashioned!  How charmingly situated!--Venerable, venerable

pile--"



"Pairdon, Doctor, zis is not ze Louvre--it is--"



"What is it?"



"I have ze idea--it come to me in a moment--zat ze silk in zis magazin--"



"Ferguson, how heedless I am.  I fully intended to tell you that we did

not wish to buy any silks to-day, and I also intended to tell you that we

yearned to go immediately to the palace of the Louvre, but enjoying the

happiness of seeing you devour four breakfasts this morning has so filled

me with pleasurable emotions that I neglect the commonest interests of

the time.  However, we will proceed now to the Louvre, Ferguson."



"But, doctor," (excitedly,) "it will take not a minute--not but one small

minute!  Ze gentleman need not to buy if he not wish to--but only look at

ze silk--look at ze beautiful fabric.  [Then pleadingly.] Sair--just only

one leetle moment!"



Dan said, "Confound the idiot!  I don't want to see any silks today, and

I won't look at them.  Drive on."



And the doctor: "We need no silks now, Ferguson.  Our hearts yearn for

the Louvre.  Let us journey on--let us journey on."



"But doctor!  It is only one moment--one leetle moment.  And ze time will

be save--entirely save!  Because zere is nothing to see now--it is too

late.  It want ten minute to four and ze Louvre close at four--only one

leetle moment, Doctor!"



The treacherous miscreant!  After four breakfasts and a gallon of

champagne, to serve us such a scurvy trick.  We got no sight of the

countless treasures of art in the Louvre galleries that day, and our only

poor little satisfaction was in the reflection that Ferguson sold not a

solitary silk dress pattern.



I am writing this chapter partly for the satisfaction of abusing that

accomplished knave Billfinger, and partly to show whosoever shall read

this how Americans fare at the hands of the Paris guides and what sort of

people Paris guides are.  It need not be supposed that we were a stupider

or an easier prey than our countrymen generally are, for we were not.

The guides deceive and defraud every American who goes to Paris for the

first time and sees its sights alone or in company with others as little

experienced as himself.  I shall visit Paris again someday, and then let

the guides beware!  I shall go in my war paint--I shall carry my tomahawk

along.



I think we have lost but little time in Paris.  We have gone to bed every

night tired out.  Of course we visited the renowned International

Exposition.  All the world did that.  We went there on our third day in

Paris--and we stayed there nearly two hours.  That was our first and last

visit.  To tell the truth, we saw at a glance that one would have to

spend weeks--yea, even months--in that monstrous establishment to get an

intelligible idea of it.  It was a wonderful show, but the moving masses

of people of all nations we saw there were a still more wonderful show.

I discovered that if I were to stay there a month, I should still find

myself looking at the people instead of the inanimate objects on

exhibition.  I got a little interested in some curious old tapestries of

the thirteenth century, but a party of Arabs came by, and their dusky

faces and quaint costumes called my attention away at once.  I watched a

silver swan, which had a living grace about his movements and a living

intelligence in his eyes--watched him swimming about as comfortably and

as unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a

jeweler's shop--watched him seize a silver fish from under the water and

hold up his head and go through all the customary and elaborate motions

of swallowing it--but the moment it disappeared down his throat some

tattooed South Sea Islanders approached and I yielded to their

attractions.



Presently I found a revolving pistol several hundred years old which

looked strangely like a modern Colt, but just then I heard that the

Empress of the French was in another part of the building, and hastened

away to see what she might look like.  We heard martial music--we saw an

unusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly about--there was a general

movement among the people.  We inquired what it was all about and learned

that the Emperor of the French and the Sultan of Turkey were about to

review twenty-five thousand troops at the Arc de l'Etoile.  We

immediately departed.  I had a greater anxiety to see these men than I

could have had to see twenty expositions.



We drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite the

American minister's house.  A speculator bridged a couple of barrels with

a board and we hired standing places on it.  Presently there was a sound

of distant music; in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowly

toward us; a moment more and then, with colors flying and a grand crash

of military music, a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dust

and came down the street on a gentle trot.  After them came a long line

of artillery; then more cavalry, in splendid uniforms; and then their

imperial majesties Napoleon III and Abdul Aziz.  The vast concourse of

people swung their hats and shouted--the windows and housetops in the

wide vicinity burst into a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs, and the

wavers of the same mingled their cheers with those of the masses below.

It was a stirring spectacle.



But the two central figures claimed all my attention.  Was ever such a

contrast set up before a multitude till then?  Napoleon in military

uniform--a long-bodied, short-legged man, fiercely moustached, old,

wrinkled, with eyes half closed, and such a deep, crafty, scheming

expression about them!--Napoleon, bowing ever so gently to the loud

plaudits, and watching everything and everybody with his cat eyes from

under his depressed hat brim, as if to discover any sign that those

cheers were not heartfelt and cordial.



Abdul Aziz, absolute lord of the Ottoman empire--clad in dark green

European clothes, almost without ornament or insignia of rank; a red

Turkish fez on his head; a short, stout, dark man, black-bearded, black-

eyed, stupid, unprepossessing--a man whose whole appearance somehow

suggested that if he only had a cleaver in his hand and a white apron on,

one would not be at all surprised to hear him say: "A mutton roast today,

or will you have a nice porterhouse steak?"



Napoleon III, the representative of the highest modern civilization,

progress, and refinement; Abdul-Aziz, the representative of a people by

nature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive,

superstitious--and a government whose Three Graces are Tyranny, Rapacity,

Blood.  Here in brilliant Paris, under this majestic Arch of Triumph, the

First Century greets the Nineteenth!



NAPOLEON III., Emperor of France!  Surrounded by shouting thousands, by

military pomp, by the splendors of his capital city, and companioned by

kings and princes--this is the man who was sneered at and reviled and

called Bastard--yet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all the

while; who was driven into exile--but carried his dreams with him; who

associated with the common herd in America and ran foot races for a

wager--but still sat upon a throne in fancy; who braved every danger to

go to his dying mother--and grieved that she could not be spared to see

him cast aside his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty; who kept

his faithful watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman of

London--but dreamed the while of a coming night when he should tread the

long-drawn corridors of the Tuileries; who made the miserable fiasco of

Strasbourg; saw his poor, shabby eagle, forgetful of its lesson, refuse

to perch upon his shoulder; delivered his carefully prepared, sententious

burst of eloquence upon unsympathetic ears; found himself a prisoner, the

butt of small wits, a mark for the pitiless ridicule of all the world--

yet went on dreaming of coronations and splendid pageants as before; who

lay a forgotten captive in the dungeons of Ham--and still schemed and

planned and pondered over future glory and future power; President of

France at last! a coup d'etat, and surrounded by applauding armies,

welcomed by the thunders of cannon, he mounts a throne and waves before

an astounded world the sceptre of a mighty empire!  Who talks of the

marvels of fiction?  Who speaks of the wonders of romance?  Who prates of

the tame achievements of Aladdin and the Magii of Arabia?



ABDUL-AZIZ, Sultan of Turkey, Lord of the Ottoman Empire!  Born to a

throne; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of a

vast royalty, yet the puppet of his Premier and the obedient child of a

tyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose finger

moves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life and

death over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with his

eight hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating and

sleeping and idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of government

and threaten to be a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary Fuad

Pacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed away

with a new toy, like any other restless child; a man who sees his people

robbed and oppressed by soulless tax-gatherers, but speaks no word to

save them; who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of The

Arabian Nights, but has small regard for the mighty magicians of to-day,

and is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads and

steamboats and telegraphs; who would see undone in Egypt all that great

Mehemet Ali achieved, and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him;

a man who found his great empire a blot upon the earth--a degraded,

poverty-stricken, miserable, infamous agglomeration of ignorance, crime,

and brutality--and will idle away the allotted days of his trivial life

and then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so!



Napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten years

to such a degree that figures can hardly compute it.  He has rebuilt

Paris and has partly rebuilt every city in the state.  He condemns a

whole street at a time, assesses the damages, pays them, and rebuilds

superbly.  Then speculators buy up the ground and sell, but the original

owner is given the first choice by the government at a stated price

before the speculator is permitted to purchase.  But above all things, he

has taken the sole control of the empire of France into his hands and

made it a tolerably free land--for people who will not attempt to go too

far in meddling with government affairs.  No country offers greater

security to life and property than France, and one has all the freedom he

wants, but no license--no license to interfere with anybody or make

anyone uncomfortable.



As for the Sultan, one could set a trap any where and catch a dozen abler

men in a night.



The bands struck up, and the brilliant adventurer, Napoleon III., the

genius of Energy, Persistence, Enterprise; and the feeble Abdul-Aziz, the

genius of Ignorance, Bigotry, and Indolence, prepared for the Forward--

March!



We saw the splendid review, we saw the white-moustached old Crimean

soldier, Canrobert, Marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw every thing,

and then we went home satisfied.









CHAPTER XIV.



We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame.  We had heard of it before.

It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how

intelligent we are.  We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment;

it was like the pictures.  We stood at a little distance and changed from

one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square

towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints

who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages.  The

Patriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and

romance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago;

and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the

most thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary

spectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris.  These battered and

broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad

knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above

them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and they saw the

slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage

of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two

Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a

regiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day--and they may possibly

continue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away

and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins.  I wish

these old parties could speak.  They could tell a tale worth the

listening to.



They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the

old Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago--remains of it are still

preserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D.

300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations

of the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100.  The ground ought to

be measurably sacred by this time, one would think.  One portion of this

noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times.

It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience

at rest--he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans.  Alas!  Those good old

times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and

soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar

and building an addition to a church.



The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars.

They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings

for the reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon they

had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again!  And they

did.



We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at

the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and

crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great

pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and

shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon

I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great

public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true

cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns.

We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the

Azores, but no nails.  They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that

archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the

wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft

the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter.  His

noble effort cost him his life.  He was shot dead.  They showed us a cast

of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two

vertebrae in which it lodged.  These people have a somewhat singular

taste in the matter of relics.  Ferguson told us that the silver cross

which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into

the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then

an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did

dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame,

to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of

miraculous intervention.



Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead

who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal

secret.  We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which

was hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-

soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician vestments,

hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was crushed and

bloody.  On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked, swollen, purple;

clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so

petrified that human strength could not unloose it--mute witness of the

last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help.

A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face.  We knew

that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends,

but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or

grieve for its loss.  We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty

years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her

knee, and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied

pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever

flitted through her brain.  I half feared that the mother, or the wife or

a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there, but nothing of

the kind occurred.  Men and women came, and some looked eagerly in and

pressed their faces against the bars; others glanced carelessly at the

body and turned away with a disappointed look--people, I thought, who

live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the Morgue

regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every

night.  When one of these looked in and passed on, I could not help

thinking--



"Now this don't afford you any satisfaction--a party with his head shot

off is what you need."



One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid a

little while.  We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however,

and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment

in a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres.  We went to the railroad

depot, toward evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-class

carriage.  Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen--but there

was no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism.  Some of the women and young

girls that entered the train we knew to be of the demi-monde, but others

we were not at all sure about.



The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and

becomingly all the way out, except that they smoked.  When we arrived at

the garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a

place which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving

rows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower

convenient for eating ice cream in.  We moved along the sinuous gravel

walks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a

domed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over again

with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun.  Nearby was a

large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way,

and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America.



"Well!" I said.  "How is this?"  It nearly took my breath away.



Ferguson said an American--a New Yorker--kept the place, and was carrying

on quite a stirring opposition to the Jardin Mabille.



Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the

garden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the

temple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking.  The dancing had not begun

yet.  Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition.  The famous Blondin

was going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden.  We

went thither.  Here the light was dim, and the masses of people were

pretty closely packed together.  And now I made a mistake which any

donkey might make, but a sensible man never.  I committed an error which

I find myself repeating every day of my life.  Standing right before a

young lady, I said:



"Dan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!"



"I thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, than

for the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!"  This in good,

pure English.



We took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened.  I did not

feel right comfortable for some time afterward.  Why will people be so

stupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten

thousand persons?



But Blondin came out shortly.  He appeared on a stretched cable, far away

above the sea of tossing hats and handkerchiefs, and in the glare of the

hundreds of rockets that whizzed heavenward by him he looked like a wee

insect.  He balanced his pole and walked the length of his rope--two or

three hundred feet; he came back and got a man and carried him across; he

returned to the center and danced a jig; next he performed some gymnastic

and balancing feats too perilous to afford a pleasant spectacle; and he

finished by fastening to his person a thousand Roman candles, Catherine

wheels, serpents and rockets of all manner of brilliant colors, setting

them on fire all at once and walking and waltzing across his rope again

in a blinding blaze of glory that lit up the garden and the people's

faces like a great conflagration at midnight.



The dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple.  Within it was a

drinking saloon, and all around it was a broad circular platform for the

dancers.  I backed up against the wall of the temple, and waited.  Twenty

sets formed, the music struck up, and then--I placed my hands before my

face for very shame.  But I looked through my fingers.  They were dancing

the renowned "Can-can."  A handsome girl in the set before me tripped

forward lightly to meet the opposite gentleman, tripped back again,

grasped her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands, raised them

pretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had more activity and

exposure about it than any jig I ever saw before, and then, drawing her

clothes still higher, she advanced gaily to the center and launched a

vicious kick full at her vis-a-vis that must infallibly have removed his

nose if he had been seven feet high.  It was a mercy he was only six.



That is the can-can.  The idea of it is to dance as wildly, as noisily,

as furiously as you can; expose yourself as much as possible if you are a

woman; and kick as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to.

There is no word of exaggeration in this.  Any of the staid, respectable,

aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that

statement.  There were a good many such people present.  I suppose French

morality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at

trifles.



I moved aside and took a general view of the can-can.  Shouts, laughter,

furious music, a bewildering chaos of darting and intermingling forms,

stormy jerking and snatching of gay dresses, bobbing beads, flying arms,

lightning flashes of white-stockinged calves and dainty slippers in the

air, and then a grand final rush, riot, a terrific hubbub, and a wild

stampede!  Heavens!  Nothing like it has been seen on earth since

trembling Tam O'Shanter saw the devil and the witches at their orgies

that stormy night in "Alloway's auld haunted kirk."



We visited the Louvre, at a time when we had no silk purchases in view,

and looked at its miles of paintings by the old masters.  Some of them

were beautiful, but at the same time they carried such evidences about

them of the cringing spirit of those great men that we found small

pleasure in examining them.  Their nauseous adulation of princely patrons

was more prominent to me and chained my attention more surely than the

charms of color and expression which are claimed to be in the pictures.

Gratitude for kindnesses is well, but it seems to me that some of those

artists carried it so far that it ceased to be gratitude and became

worship.  If there is a plausible excuse for the worship of men, then by

all means let us forgive Rubens and his brethren.



But I will drop the subject, lest I say something about the old masters

that might as well be left unsaid.



Of course we drove in the Bois de Boulogne, that limitless park, with its

forests, its lakes, its cascades, and its broad avenues.  There were

thousands upon thousands of vehicles abroad, and the scene was full of

life and gaiety.  There were very common hacks, with father and mother

and all the children in them; conspicuous little open carriages with

celebrated ladies of questionable reputation in them; there were Dukes

and Duchesses abroad, with gorgeous footmen perched behind, and equally

gorgeous outriders perched on each of the six horses; there were blue and

silver, and green and gold, and pink and black, and all sorts and

descriptions of stunning and startling liveries out, and I almost yearned

to be a flunkey myself, for the sake of the fine clothes.



But presently the Emperor came along and he outshone them all.  He was

preceded by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showy uniforms, his

carriage-horses (there appeared to be somewhere in the remote

neighborhood of a thousand of them,) were bestridden by gallant-looking

fellows, also in stylish uniforms, and after the carriage followed

another detachment of bodyguards.  Everybody got out of the way;

everybody bowed to the Emperor and his friend the Sultan; and they went

by on a swinging trot and disappeared.



I will not describe the Bois de Boulogne.  I can not do it.  It is simply

a beautiful, cultivated, endless, wonderful wilderness.  It is an

enchanting place.  It is in Paris now, one may say, but a crumbling old

cross in one portion of it reminds one that it was not always so.  The

cross marks the spot where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid and

murdered in the fourteenth century.  It was in this park that that fellow

with an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the Russian Czar's

life last spring with a pistol.  The bullet struck a tree.  Ferguson

showed us the place.  Now in America that interesting tree would be

chopped down or forgotten within the next five years, but it will be

treasured here.  The guides will point it out to visitors for the next

eight hundred years, and when it decays and falls down they will put up

another there and go on with the same old story just the same.









CHAPTER XV.



One of our pleasantest visits was to Pere la Chaise, the national

burying-ground of France, the honored resting-place of some of her

greatest and best children, the last home of scores of illustrious men

and women who were born to no titles, but achieved fame by their own

energy and their own genius.  It is a solemn city of winding streets and

of miniature marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white from

out a wilderness of foliage and fresh flowers.  Not every city is so well

peopled as this, or has so ample an area within its walls.  Few palaces

exist in any city that are so exquisite in design, so rich in art, so

costly in material, so graceful, so beautiful.



We had stood in the ancient church of St. Denis, where the marble

effigies of thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched at

length upon the tombs, and the sensations invoked were startling and

novel; the curious armor, the obsolete costumes, the placid faces, the

hands placed palm to palm in eloquent supplication--it was a vision of

gray antiquity.  It seemed curious enough to be standing face to face, as

it were, with old Dagobert I., and Clovis and Charlemagne, those vague,

colossal heroes, those shadows, those myths of a thousand years ago!  I

touched their dust-covered faces with my finger, but Dagobert was deader

than the sixteen centuries that have passed over him, Clovis slept well

after his labor for Christ, and old Charlemagne went on dreaming of his

paladins, of bloody Roncesvalles, and gave no heed to me.



The great names of Pere la Chaise impress one, too, but differently.

There the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is, that this place

is sacred to a nobler royalty--the royalty of heart and brain.  Every

faculty of mind, every noble trait of human nature, every high occupation

which men engage in, seems represented by a famous name.  The effect is a

curious medley.  Davoust and Massena, who wrought in many a battle

tragedy, are here, and so also is Rachel, of equal renown in mimic

tragedy on the stage.  The Abbe Sicard sleeps here--the first great

teacher of the deaf and dumb--a man whose heart went out to every

unfortunate, and whose life was given to kindly offices in their service;

and not far off, in repose and peace at last, lies Marshal Ney, whose

stormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms.  The man who

originated public gas-lighting, and that other benefactor who introduced

the cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starving

countrymen, lie with the Prince of Masserano, and with exiled queens and

princes of Further India.  Gay-Lussac the chemist, Laplace the

astronomer, Larrey the surgeon, de Suze the advocate, are here, and with

them are Talma, Bellini, Rubini; de Balzac, Beaumarchais, Beranger;

Moliere and Lafontaine, and scores of other men whose names and whose

worthy labors are as familiar in the remote by-places of civilization as

are the historic deeds of the kings and princes that sleep in the marble

vaults of St. Denis.



But among the thousands and thousands of tombs in Pere la Chaise, there

is one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes by

without stopping to examine.  Every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea

of the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, but

not one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and

its romantic occupants.  This is the grave of Abelard and Heloise--a

grave which has been more revered, more widely known, more written and

sung about and wept over, for seven hundred years, than any other in

Christendom save only that of the Saviour.  All visitors linger pensively

about it; all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoes

of it; all Parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love come

there to bail out when they are full of tears; yea, many stricken lovers

make pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wail

and "grit" their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and to purchase the

sympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings of

immortelles and budding flowers.



Go when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb.  Go when

you will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles.  Go

when you will, you find a gravel-train from Marseilles arriving to supply

the deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affections

have miscarried.



Yet who really knows the story of Abelard and Heloise?  Precious few

people.  The names are perfectly familiar to every body, and that is

about all.  With infinite pains I have acquired a knowledge of that

history, and I propose to narrate it here, partly for the honest

information of the public and partly to show that public that they have

been wasting a good deal of marketable sentiment very unnecessarily.





                       STORY OF ABELARD AND HELOISE



Heloise was born seven hundred and sixty-six years ago.  She may have had

parents.  There is no telling.  She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a canon

of the cathedral of Paris.  I do not know what a canon of a cathedral is,

but that is what he was.  He was nothing more than a sort of a mountain

howitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days.

Suffice it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was

happy.  She spent the most of her childhood in the convent of Argenteuil

--never heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such a

place.  She then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, as

the case may be, and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which was

the language of literature and polite society at that period.



Just at this time, Pierre Abelard, who had already made himself widely

famous as a rhetorician, came to found a school of rhetoric in Paris.

The originality of his principles, his eloquence, and his great physical

strength and beauty created a profound sensation.  He saw Heloise, and

was captivated by her blooming youth, her beauty, and her charming

disposition.  He wrote to her; she answered.  He wrote again; she

answered again.  He was now in love.  He longed to know her--to speak to

her face to face.



His school was near Fulbert's house.  He asked Fulbert to allow him to

call.  The good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity: his niece, whom

he so much loved, would absorb knowledge from this man, and it would not

cost him a cent.  Such was Fulbert--penurious.



Fulbert's first name is not mentioned by any author, which is

unfortunate.  However, George W. Fulbert will answer for him as well as

any other.  We will let him go at that.  He asked Abelard to teach her.



Abelard was glad enough of the opportunity.  He came often and staid

long.  A letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he came

under that friendly roof like a cold-hearted villain as he was, with the

deliberate intention of debauching a confiding, innocent girl.  This is

the letter:



          "I cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of Fulbert;

          I was as much surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power

          of a hungry wolf.  Heloise and I, under pretext of study, gave

          ourselves up wholly to love, and the solitude that love seeks

          our studies procured for us.  Books were open before us, but we

          spoke oftener of love than philosophy, and kisses came more

          readily from our lips than words."



And so, exulting over an honorable confidence which to his degraded

instinct was a ludicrous "simplicity," this unmanly Abelard seduced the

niece of the man whose guest he was.  Paris found it out.  Fulbert was

told of it--told often--but refused to believe it.  He could not

comprehend how a man could be so depraved as to use the sacred protection

and security of hospitality as a means for the commission of such a crime

as that.  But when he heard the rowdies in the streets singing the love-

songs of Abelard to Heloise, the case was too plain--love-songs come not

properly within the teachings of rhetoric and philosophy.



He drove Abelard from his house.  Abelard returned secretly and carried

Heloise away to Palais, in Brittany, his native country.  Here, shortly

afterward, she bore a son, who, from his rare beauty, was surnamed

Astrolabe--William G.  The girl's flight enraged Fulbert, and he longed

for vengeance, but feared to strike lest retaliation visit Heloise--for

he still loved her tenderly.  At length Abelard offered to marry Heloise

--but on a shameful condition: that the marriage should be kept secret

from the world, to the end that (while her good name remained a wreck, as

before,) his priestly reputation might be kept untarnished.  It was like

that miscreant.  Fulbert saw his opportunity and consented.  He would see

the parties married, and then violate the confidence of the man who had

taught him that trick; he would divulge the secret and so remove somewhat

of the obloquy that attached to his niece's fame.  But the niece

suspected his scheme.  She refused the marriage at first; she said

Fulbert would betray the secret to save her, and besides, she did not

wish to drag down a lover who was so gifted, so honored by the world, and

who had such a splendid career before him.  It was noble, self-

sacrificing love, and characteristic of the pure-souled Heloise, but it

was not good sense.



But she was overruled, and the private marriage took place.  Now for

Fulbert!  The heart so wounded should be healed at last; the proud spirit

so tortured should find rest again; the humbled head should be lifted up

once more.  He proclaimed the marriage in the high places of the city and

rejoiced that dishonor had departed from his house.  But lo!  Abelard

denied the marriage!  Heloise denied it!  The people, knowing the former

circumstances, might have believed Fulbert had only Abelard denied it,

but when the person chiefly interested--the girl herself--denied it, they

laughed, despairing Fulbert to scorn.



The poor canon of the cathedral of Paris was spiked again.  The last hope

of repairing the wrong that had been done his house was gone.  What next?

Human nature suggested revenge.  He compassed it.  The historian says:



          "Ruffians, hired by Fulbert, fell upon Abelard by night, and

          inflicted upon him a terrible and nameless mutilation."



I am seeking the last resting place of those "ruffians."  When I find it

I shall shed some tears on it, and stack up some bouquets and

immortelles, and cart away from it some gravel whereby to remember that

howsoever blotted by crime their lives may have been, these ruffians did

one just deed, at any rate, albeit it was not warranted by the strict

letter of the law.



Heloise entered a convent and gave good-bye to the world and its

pleasures for all time.  For twelve years she never heard of Abelard--

never even heard his name mentioned.  She had become prioress of

Argenteuil and led a life of complete seclusion.  She happened one day to

see a letter written by him, in which he narrated his own history.  She

cried over it and wrote him.  He answered, addressing her as his "sister

in Christ."  They continued to correspond, she in the unweighed language

of unwavering affection, he in the chilly phraseology of the polished

rhetorician.  She poured out her heart in passionate, disjointed

sentences; he replied with finished essays, divided deliberately into

heads and sub-heads, premises and argument.  She showered upon him the

tenderest epithets that love could devise, he addressed her from the

North Pole of his frozen heart as the "Spouse of Christ!"  The abandoned

villain!



On account of her too easy government of her nuns, some disreputable

irregularities were discovered among them, and the Abbot of St. Denis

broke up her establishment.  Abelard was the official head of the

monastery of St. Gildas de Ruys, at that time, and when he heard of her

homeless condition a sentiment of pity was aroused in his breast (it is a

wonder the unfamiliar emotion did not blow his head off,) and he placed

her and her troop in the little oratory of the Paraclete, a religious

establishment which he had founded.  She had many privations and

sufferings to undergo at first, but her worth and her gentle disposition

won influential friends for her, and she built up a wealthy and

flourishing nunnery.  She became a great favorite with the heads of the

church, and also the people, though she seldom appeared in public.  She

rapidly advanced in esteem, in good report, and in usefulness, and

Abelard as rapidly lost ground.  The Pope so honored her that he made her

the head of her order.  Abelard, a man of splendid talents, and ranking

as the first debater of his time, became timid, irresolute, and

distrustful of his powers.  He only needed a great misfortune to topple

him from the high position he held in the world of intellectual

excellence, and it came.  Urged by kings and princes to meet the subtle

St. Bernard in debate and crush him, he stood up in the presence of a

royal and illustrious assemblage, and when his antagonist had finished he

looked about him and stammered a commencement; but his courage failed

him, the cunning of his tongue was gone: with his speech unspoken, he

trembled and sat down, a disgraced and vanquished champion.



He died a nobody, and was buried at Cluny, A.D., 1144.  They removed his

body to the Paraclete afterward, and when Heloise died, twenty years

later, they buried her with him, in accordance with her last wish.  He

died at the ripe age of 64, and she at 63.  After the bodies had remained

entombed three hundred years, they were removed once more.  They were

removed again in 1800, and finally, seventeen years afterward, they were

taken up and transferred to Pere la Chaise, where they will remain in

peace and quiet until it comes time for them to get up and move again.



History is silent concerning the last acts of the mountain howitzer.  Let

the world say what it will about him, I, at least, shall always respect

the memory and sorrow for the abused trust and the broken heart and the

troubled spirit of the old smooth-bore.  Rest and repose be his!



Such is the story of Abelard and Heloise.  Such is the history that

Lamartine has shed such cataracts of tears over.  But that man never

could come within the influence of a subject in the least pathetic

without overflowing his banks.  He ought to be dammed--or leveed, I

should more properly say.  Such is the history--not as it is usually

told, but as it is when stripped of the nauseous sentimentality that

would enshrine for our loving worship a dastardly seducer like Pierre

Abelard.  I have not a word to say against the misused, faithful girl,

and would not withhold from her grave a single one of those simple

tributes which blighted youths and maidens offer to her memory, but I am

sorry enough that I have not time and opportunity to write four or five

volumes of my opinion of her friend the founder of the Parachute, or the

Paraclete, or whatever it was.



The tons of sentiment I have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in my

ignorance!  I shall throttle down my emotions hereafter, about this sort

of people, until I have read them up and know whether they are entitled

to any tearful attentions or not.  I wish I had my immortelles back, now,

and that bunch of radishes.



In Paris we often saw in shop windows the sign "English Spoken Here,"

just as one sees in the windows at home the sign "Ici on parle

francaise."  We always invaded these places at once--and invariably

received the information, framed in faultless French, that the clerk who

did the English for the establishment had just gone to dinner and would

be back in an hour--would Monsieur buy something?  We wondered why those

parties happened to take their dinners at such erratic and extraordinary

hours, for we never called at a time when an exemplary Christian would be

in the least likely to be abroad on such an errand.  The truth was, it

was a base fraud--a snare to trap the unwary--chaff to catch fledglings

with.  They had no English-murdering clerk.  They trusted to the sign to

inveigle foreigners into their lairs, and trusted to their own

blandishments to keep them there till they bought something.



We ferreted out another French imposition--a frequent sign to this

effect: "ALL MANNER OF AMERICAN DRINKS ARTISTICALLY PREPARED HERE."  We

procured the services of a gentleman experienced in the nomenclature of

the American bar, and moved upon the works of one of these impostors.  A

bowing, aproned Frenchman skipped forward and said:



"Que voulez les messieurs?"  I do not know what "Que voulez les

messieurs?"  means, but such was his remark.



Our general said, "We will take a whiskey straight."



[A stare from the Frenchman.]



"Well, if you don't know what that is, give us a champagne cock-tail."



[A stare and a shrug.]



"Well, then, give us a sherry cobbler."



The Frenchman was checkmated.  This was all Greek to him.



"Give us a brandy smash!"



The Frenchman began to back away, suspicious of the ominous vigor of the

last order--began to back away, shrugging his shoulders and spreading his

hands apologetically.



The General followed him up and gained a complete victory.  The

uneducated foreigner could not even furnish a Santa Cruz Punch, an Eye-

Opener, a Stone-Fence, or an Earthquake.  It was plain that he was a

wicked impostor.



An acquaintance of mine said the other day that he was doubtless the only

American visitor to the Exposition who had had the high honor of being

escorted by the Emperor's bodyguard.  I said with unobtrusive frankness

that I was astonished that such a long-legged, lantern-jawed,

unprepossessing-looking specter as he should be singled out for a

distinction like that, and asked how it came about.  He said he had

attended a great military review in the Champ de Mars some time ago, and

while the multitude about him was growing thicker and thicker every

moment he observed an open space inside the railing.  He left his

carriage and went into it.  He was the only person there, and so he had

plenty of room, and the situation being central, he could see all the

preparations going on about the field.  By and by there was a sound of

music, and soon the Emperor of the French and the Emperor of Austria,

escorted by the famous Cent Gardes, entered the enclosure.  They seemed

not to observe him, but directly, in response to a sign from the

commander of the guard, a young lieutenant came toward him with a file of

his men following, halted, raised his hand, and gave the military salute,

and then said in a low voice that he was sorry to have to disturb a

stranger and a gentleman, but the place was sacred to royalty.  Then this

New Jersey phantom rose up and bowed and begged pardon, then with the

officer beside him, the file of men marching behind him, and with every

mark of respect, he was escorted to his carriage by the imperial Cent

Gardes!  The officer saluted again and fell back, the New Jersey sprite

bowed in return and had presence of mind enough to pretend that he had

simply called on a matter of private business with those emperors, and so

waved them an adieu and drove from the field!



Imagine a poor Frenchman ignorantly intruding upon a public rostrum

sacred to some six-penny dignitary in America.  The police would scare

him to death first with a storm of their elegant blasphemy, and then pull

him to pieces getting him away from there.  We are measurably superior to

the French in some things, but they are immeasurably our betters in

others.



Enough of Paris for the present.  We have done our whole duty by it.  We

have seen the Tuileries, the Napoleon Column, the Madeleine, that wonder

of wonders the tomb of Napoleon, all the great churches and museums,

libraries, imperial palaces, and sculpture and picture galleries, the

Pantheon, Jardin des Plantes, the opera, the circus, the legislative

body, the billiard rooms, the barbers, the grisettes--



Ah, the grisettes!  I had almost forgotten.  They are another romantic

fraud.  They were (if you let the books of travel tell it) always so

beautiful--so neat and trim, so graceful--so naive and trusting--so

gentle, so winning--so faithful to their shop duties, so irresistible to

buyers in their prattling importunity--so devoted to their poverty-

stricken students of the Latin Quarter--so lighthearted and happy on

their Sunday picnics in the suburbs--and oh, so charmingly, so

delightfully immoral!



Stuff!  For three or four days I was constantly saying:



"Quick, Ferguson!  Is that a grisette?"



And he always said, "No."



He comprehended at last that I wanted to see a grisette.  Then he showed

me dozens of them.  They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw

--homely.  They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug

noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good breeding

could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting;

they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I

knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and

finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.



Aroint thee, wench!  I sorrow for the vagabond student of the Latin

Quarter now, even more than formerly I envied him.  Thus topples to earth

another idol of my infancy.



We have seen every thing, and tomorrow we go to Versailles.  We shall see

Paris only for a little while as we come back to take up our line of

march for the ship, and so I may as well bid the beautiful city a

regretful farewell.  We shall travel many thousands of miles after we

leave here and visit many great cities, but we shall find none so

enchanting as this.



Some of our party have gone to England, intending to take a roundabout

course and rejoin the vessel at Leghorn or Naples several weeks hence.

We came near going to Geneva, but have concluded to return to Marseilles

and go up through Italy from Genoa.



I will conclude this chapter with a remark that I am sincerely proud to

be able to make--and glad, as well, that my comrades cordially endorse

it, to wit: by far the handsomest women we have seen in France were born

and reared in America.



I feel now like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shed

luster upon a dimmed escutcheon, by a single just deed done at the

eleventh hour.



Let the curtain fall, to slow music.









CHAPTER XVI.



VERSAILLES!  It is wonderfully beautiful!  You gaze and stare and try to

understand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not the

Garden of Eden--but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world of

beauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite

dream.  The scene thrills one like military music!  A noble palace,

stretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed

that it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies

of an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossal

statues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered over

the ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading down from the

promenade to lower grounds of the park--stairways that whole regiments

might stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast fountains whose

great bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the air

and mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty;

wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in every

direction and wandered to seemingly interminable distances, walled all

the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branches

met above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever were

carved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with

miniature ships glassed in their surfaces.  And every where--on the

palace steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among the

trees, and far under the arches of the endless avenues--hundreds and

hundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave to

the fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection it

could have lacked.



It was worth a pilgrimage to see.  Everything is on so gigantic a scale.

Nothing is small--nothing is cheap.  The statues are all large; the

palace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are

interminable.  All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles

are vast.  I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and

these dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles more

beautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be.  I know

now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, and

that no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it

is in reality.  I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred

millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so

scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now.  He took a

tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this

park and build this palace and a road to it from Paris.  He kept 36,000

men employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used

to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night.  The wife of a

nobleman of the time speaks of this as an "inconvenience," but naively

remarks that "it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of

tranquillity we now enjoy."



I always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery into

pyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes, and

when I saw the same thing being practiced in this great park I began to

feel dissatisfied.  But I soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdom

of it.  They seek the general effect.  We distort a dozen sickly trees

into unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room,

and then surely they look absurd enough.  But here they take two hundred

thousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row; allow no sign of

leaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above the

ground; from that point the boughs begin to project, and very gradually

they extend outward further and further till they meet overhead, and a

faultless tunnel of foliage is formed.  The arch is mathematically

precise.  The effect is then very fine.  They make trees take fifty

different shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely varied and

picturesque.  The trees in no two avenues are shaped alike, and

consequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature of

monotonous uniformity.  I will drop this subject now, leaving it to

others to determine how these people manage to make endless ranks of

lofty forest trees grow to just a certain thickness of trunk (say a foot

and two-thirds); how they make them spring to precisely the same height

for miles; how they make them grow so close together; how they compel one

huge limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and form

the main sweep of the arch; and how all these things are kept exactly in

the same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness and symmetry

month after month and year after year--for I have tried to reason out the

problem and have failed.



We walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred and

fifty galleries of paintings in the palace of Versailles, and felt that

to be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his

disposal.  These pictures are all battle scenes, and only one solitary

little canvas among them all treats of anything but great French

victories.  We wandered, also, through the Grand Trianon and the Petit

Trianon, those monuments of royal prodigality, and with histories so

mournful--filled, as it is, with souvenirs of Napoleon the First, and

three dead kings and as many queens.  In one sumptuous bed they had all

slept in succession, but no one occupies it now.  In a large dining room

stood the table at which Louis XIV and his mistress Madame Maintenon, and

after them Louis XV, and Pompadour, had sat at their meals naked and

unattended--for the table stood upon a trapdoor, which descended with it

to regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes.  In a

room of the Petit Trianon stood the furniture, just as poor Marie

Antoinette left it when the mob came and dragged her and the King to

Paris, never to return.  Near at hand, in the stables, were prodigious

carriages that showed no color but gold--carriages used by former kings

of France on state occasions, and never used now save when a kingly head

is to be crowned or an imperial infant christened.  And with them were

some curious sleighs, whose bodies were shaped like lions, swans, tigers,

etc.--vehicles that had once been handsome with pictured designs and

fine workmanship, but were dusty and decaying now.  They had their

history.  When Louis XIV had finished the Grand Trianon, he told

Maintenon he had created a Paradise for her, and asked if she could think

of anything now to wish for.  He said he wished the Trianon to be

perfection--nothing less.  She said she could think of but one thing--it

was summer, and it was balmy France--yet she would like well to sleigh

ride in the leafy avenues of Versailles!  The next morning found miles

and miles of grassy avenues spread thick with snowy salt and sugar, and a

procession of those quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief concubine

of the gaiest and most unprincipled court that France has ever seen!



From sumptuous Versailles, with its palaces, its statues, its gardens,

and its fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its antipodes--

the Faubourg St. Antoine.  Little, narrow streets; dirty children

blockading them; greasy, slovenly women capturing and spanking them;

filthy dens on first floors, with rag stores in them (the heaviest

business in the Faubourg is the chiffonier's); other filthy dens where

whole suits of second and third-hand clothing are sold at prices that

would ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still other filthy

dens where they sold groceries--sold them by the half-pennyworth--five

dollars would buy the man out, goodwill and all.  Up these little crooked

streets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump the body in the

Seine.  And up some other of these streets--most of them, I should say--

live lorettes.



All through this Faubourg St. Antoine, misery, poverty, vice, and crime

go hand in hand, and the evidences of it stare one in the face from every

side.  Here the people live who begin the revolutions.  Whenever there is

anything of that kind to be done, they are always ready.  They take as

much genuine pleasure in building a barricade as they do in cutting a

throat or shoving a friend into the Seine.  It is these savage-looking

ruffians who storm the splendid halls of the Tuileries occasionally, and

swarm into Versailles when a king is to be called to account.



But they will build no more barricades, they will break no more soldiers'

heads with paving-stones.  Louis Napoleon has taken care of all that.  He

is annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead noble

boulevards as straight as an arrow--avenues which a cannon ball could

traverse from end to end without meeting an obstruction more irresistible

than the flesh and bones of men--boulevards whose stately edifices will

never afford refuges and plotting places for starving, discontented

revolution breeders.  Five of these great thoroughfares radiate from one

ample centre--a centre which is exceedingly well adapted to the

accommodation of heavy artillery.  The mobs used to riot there, but they

must seek another rallying-place in future.  And this ingenious Napoleon

paves the streets of his great cities with a smooth, compact composition

of asphaltum and sand.  No more barricades of flagstones--no more

assaulting his Majesty's troops with cobbles.  I cannot feel friendly

toward my quondam fellow-American, Napoleon III., especially at this

time,--[July, 1867.]--when in fancy I see his credulous victim,

Maximilian, lying stark and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widow

watching eagerly from her French asylum for the form that will never

come--but I do admire his nerve, his calm self-reliance, his shrewd good

sense.









CHAPTER XVII.



We had a pleasant journey of it seaward again.  We found that for the

three past nights our ship had been in a state of war.  The first night

the sailors of a British ship, being happy with grog, came down on the

pier and challenged our sailors to a free fight.  They accepted with

alacrity, repaired to the pier, and gained--their share of a drawn

battle.  Several bruised and bloody members of both parties were carried

off by the police and imprisoned until the following morning.  The next

night the British boys came again to renew the fight, but our men had had

strict orders to remain on board and out of sight.  They did so, and the

besieging party grew noisy and more and more abusive as the fact became

apparent (to them) that our men were afraid to come out.  They went away

finally with a closing burst of ridicule and offensive epithets.  The

third night they came again and were more obstreperous than ever.  They

swaggered up and down the almost deserted pier, and hurled curses,

obscenity, and stinging sarcasms at our crew.  It was more than human

nature could bear.  The executive officer ordered our men ashore--with

instructions not to fight.  They charged the British and gained a

brilliant victory.  I probably would not have mentioned this war had it

ended differently.  But I travel to learn, and I still remember that they

picture no French defeats in the battle-galleries of Versailles.



It was like home to us to step on board the comfortable ship again and

smoke and lounge about her breezy decks.  And yet it was not altogether

like home, either, because so many members of the family were away.  We

missed some pleasant faces which we would rather have found at dinner,

and at night there were gaps in the euchre-parties which could not be

satisfactorily filled.  "Moult"  was in England, Jack in Switzerland,

Charley in Spain.  Blucher was gone, none could tell where.  But we were

at sea again, and we had the stars and the ocean to look at, and plenty

of room to meditate in.



In due time the shores of Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing from

the decks, early in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa

rose up out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundred

palaces.



Here we rest for the present--or rather, here we have been trying to

rest, for some little time, but we run about too much to accomplish a

great deal in that line.



I would like to remain here.  I had rather not go any further.  There may

be prettier women in Europe, but I doubt it.  The population of Genoa is

120,000; two-thirds of these are women, I think, and at least two-thirds

of the women are beautiful.  They are as dressy and as tasteful and as

graceful as they could possibly be without being angels.  However, angels

are not very dressy, I believe.  At least the angels in pictures are not

--they wear nothing but wings.  But these Genoese women do look so

charming.  Most of the young demoiselles are robed in a cloud of white

from head to foot, though many trick themselves out more elaborately.

Nine-tenths of them wear nothing on their heads but a filmy sort of veil,

which falls down their backs like a white mist.  They are very fair, and

many of them have blue eyes, but black and dreamy dark brown ones are met

with oftenest.



The ladies and gentlemen of Genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenading

in a large park on the top of a hill in the center of the city, from six

till nine in the evening, and then eating ices in a neighboring garden an

hour or two longer.  We went to the park on Sunday evening.  Two thousand

persons were present, chiefly young ladies and gentlemen.  The gentlemen

were dressed in the very latest Paris fashions, and the robes of the

ladies glinted among the trees like so many snowflakes.  The multitude

moved round and round the park in a great procession.  The bands played,

and so did the fountains; the moon and the gas lamps lit up the scene,

and altogether it was a brilliant and an animated picture.  I scanned

every female face that passed, and it seemed to me that all were

handsome.  I never saw such a freshet of loveliness before.  I did not

see how a man of only ordinary decision of character could marry here,

because before he could get his mind made up he would fall in love with

somebody else.



Never smoke any Italian tobacco.  Never do it on any account.  It makes

me shudder to think what it must be made of.  You cannot throw an old

cigar "stub" down anywhere, but some vagabond will pounce upon it on the

instant.  I like to smoke a good deal, but it wounds my sensibilities to

see one of these stub-hunters watching me out of the corners of his

hungry eyes and calculating how long my cigar will be likely to last.

It reminded me too painfully of that San Francisco undertaker who used to

go to sick-beds with his watch in his hand and time the corpse.  One of

these stub-hunters followed us all over the park last night, and we never

had a smoke that was worth anything.  We were always moved to appease him

with the stub before the cigar was half gone, because he looked so

viciously anxious.  He regarded us as his own legitimate prey, by right

of discovery, I think, because he drove off several other professionals

who wanted to take stock in us.



Now, they surely must chew up those old stubs, and dry and sell them for

smoking-tobacco.  Therefore, give your custom to other than Italian

brands of the article.



"The Superb" and the "City of Palaces" are names which Genoa has held for

centuries.  She is full of palaces, certainly, and the palaces are

sumptuous inside, but they are very rusty without and make no pretensions

to architectural magnificence.  "Genoa the Superb" would be a felicitous

title if it referred to the women.



We have visited several of the palaces--immense thick-walled piles, with

great stone staircases, tesselated marble pavements on the floors,

(sometimes they make a mosaic work, of intricate designs, wrought in

pebbles or little fragments of marble laid in cement,) and grand salons

hung with pictures by Rubens, Guido, Titian, Paul Veronese, and so on,

and portraits of heads of the family, in plumed helmets and gallant coats

of mail, and patrician ladies in stunning costumes of centuries ago.

But, of course, the folks were all out in the country for the summer, and

might not have known enough to ask us to dinner if they had been at home,

and so all the grand empty salons, with their resounding pavements, their

grim pictures of dead ancestors, and tattered banners with the dust of

bygone centuries upon them, seemed to brood solemnly of death and the

grave, and our spirits ebbed away, and our cheerfulness passed from us.

We never went up to the eleventh story.  We always began to suspect

ghosts.  There was always an undertaker-looking servant along, too, who

handed us a program, pointed to the picture that began the list of the

salon he was in, and then stood stiff and stark and unsmiling in his

petrified livery till we were ready to move on to the next chamber,

whereupon he marched sadly ahead and took up another malignantly

respectful position as before.  I wasted so much time praying that the

roof would fall in on these dispiriting flunkies that I had but little

left to bestow upon palace and pictures.



And besides, as in Paris, we had a guide.  Perdition catch all the

guides.  This one said he was the most gifted linguist in Genoa, as far

as English was concerned, and that only two persons in the city beside

himself could talk the language at all.  He showed us the birthplace of

Christopher Columbus, and after we had reflected in silent awe before it

for fifteen minutes, he said it was not the birthplace of Columbus, but

of Columbus' grandmother!  When we demanded an explanation of his conduct

he only shrugged his shoulders and answered in barbarous Italian.  I

shall speak further of this guide in a future chapter.  All the

information we got out of him we shall be able to carry along with us, I

think.



I have not been to church so often in a long time as I have in the last

few weeks.  The people in these old lands seem to make churches their

specialty.  Especially does this seem to be the case with the citizens of

Genoa.  I think there is a church every three or four hundred yards all

over town.  The streets are sprinkled from end to end with shovel-hatted,

long-robed, well-fed priests, and the church bells by dozens are pealing

all the day long, nearly.  Every now and then one comes across a friar of

orders gray, with shaven head, long, coarse robe, rope girdle and beads,

and with feet cased in sandals or entirely bare.  These worthies suffer

in the flesh and do penance all their lives, I suppose, but they look

like consummate famine-breeders.  They are all fat and serene.



The old Cathedral of San Lorenzo is about as notable a building as we

have found in Genoa.  It is vast, and has colonnades of noble pillars,

and a great organ, and the customary pomp of gilded moldings, pictures,

frescoed ceilings, and so forth.  I cannot describe it, of course--it

would require a good many pages to do that.  But it is a curious place.

They said that half of it--from the front door halfway down to the altar

--was a Jewish synagogue before the Saviour was born, and that no

alteration had been made in it since that time.  We doubted the

statement, but did it reluctantly.  We would much rather have believed

it.  The place looked in too perfect repair to be so ancient.



The main point of interest about the cathedral is the little Chapel of

St. John the Baptist.  They only allow women to enter it on one day in

the year, on account of the animosity they still cherish against the sex

because of the murder of the Saint to gratify a caprice of Herodias.  In

this Chapel is a marble chest, in which, they told us, were the ashes of

St. John; and around it was wound a chain, which, they said, had confined

him when he was in prison.  We did not desire to disbelieve these

statements, and yet we could not feel certain that they were correct--

partly because we could have broken that chain, and so could St. John,

and partly because we had seen St. John's ashes before, in another

church.  We could not bring ourselves to think St. John had two sets of

ashes.



They also showed us a portrait of the Madonna which was painted by St.

Luke, and it did not look half as old and smoky as some of the pictures

by Rubens.  We could not help admiring the Apostle's modesty in never

once mentioning in his writings that he could paint.



But isn't this relic matter a little overdone?  We find a piece of the

true cross in every old church we go into, and some of the nails that

held it together.  I would not like to be positive, but I think we have

seen as much as a keg of these nails.  Then there is the crown of thorns;

they have part of one in Sainte Chapelle, in Paris, and part of one also

in Notre Dame.  And as for bones of St. Denis, I feel certain we have

seen enough of them to duplicate him if necessary.



I only meant to write about the churches, but I keep wandering from the

subject.  I could say that the Church of the Annunciation is a wilderness

of beautiful columns, of statues, gilded moldings, and pictures almost

countless, but that would give no one an entirely perfect idea of the

thing, and so where is the use?  One family built the whole edifice, and

have got money left.  There is where the mystery lies.  We had an idea at

first that only a mint could have survived the expense.



These people here live in the heaviest, highest, broadest, darkest,

solidest houses one can imagine.  Each one might "laugh a siege to

scorn."  A hundred feet front and a hundred high is about the style, and

you go up three flights of stairs before you begin to come upon signs of

occupancy.  Everything is stone, and stone of the heaviest--floors,

stairways, mantels, benches--everything.  The walls are four to five feet

thick.  The streets generally are four or five to eight feet wide and as

crooked as a corkscrew.  You go along one of these gloomy cracks, and

look up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light, far above your

head, where the tops of the tall houses on either side of the street bend

almost together.  You feel as if you were at the bottom of some

tremendous abyss, with all the world far above you.  You wind in and out

and here and there, in the most mysterious way, and have no more idea of

the points of the compass than if you were a blind man.  You can never

persuade yourself that these are actually streets, and the frowning,

dingy, monstrous houses dwellings, till you see one of these beautiful,

prettily dressed women emerge from them--see her emerge from a dark,

dreary-looking den that looks dungeon all over, from the ground away

halfway up to heaven.  And then you wonder that such a charming moth

could come from such a forbidding shell as that.  The streets are wisely

made narrow and the houses heavy and thick and stony, in order that the

people may be cool in this roasting climate.  And they are cool, and stay

so.  And while I think of it--the men wear hats and have very dark

complexions, but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil like a

gossamer's web, and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing.

Singular, isn't it?



The huge palaces of Genoa are each supposed to be occupied by one family,

but they could accommodate a hundred, I should think.  They are relics of

the grandeur of Genoa's palmy days--the days when she was a great

commercial and maritime power several centuries ago.  These houses, solid

marble palaces though they be, are in many cases of a dull pinkish color,

outside, and from pavement to eaves are pictured with Genoese battle

scenes, with monstrous Jupiters and Cupids, and with familiar

illustrations from Grecian mythology.  Where the paint has yielded to age

and exposure and is peeling off in flakes and patches, the effect is not

happy.  A noseless Cupid or a Jupiter with an eye out or a Venus with a

fly-blister on her breast, are not attractive features in a picture.

Some of these painted walls reminded me somewhat of the tall van,

plastered with fanciful bills and posters, that follows the bandwagon of

a circus about a country village.  I have not read or heard that the

outsides of the houses of any other European city are frescoed in this

way.



I can not conceive of such a thing as Genoa in ruins.  Such massive

arches, such ponderous substructions as support these towering broad-

winged edifices, we have seldom seen before; and surely the great blocks

of stone of which these edifices are built can never decay; walls that

are as thick as an ordinary American doorway is high cannot crumble.



The republics of Genoa and Pisa were very powerful in the Middle Ages.

Their ships filled the Mediterranean, and they carried on an extensive

commerce with Constantinople and Syria.  Their warehouses were the great

distributing depots from whence the costly merchandise of the East was

sent abroad over Europe.  They were warlike little nations and defied, in

those days, governments that overshadow them now as mountains overshadow

molehills.  The Saracens captured and pillaged Genoa nine hundred years

ago, but during the following century Genoa and Pisa entered into an

offensive and defensive alliance and besieged the Saracen colonies in

Sardinia and the Balearic Isles with an obstinacy that maintained its

pristine vigor and held to its purpose for forty long years.  They were

victorious at last and divided their conquests equably among their great

patrician families.  Descendants of some of those proud families still

inhabit the palaces of Genoa, and trace in their own features a

resemblance to the grim knights whose portraits hang in their stately

halls, and to pictured beauties with pouting lips and merry eyes whose

originals have been dust and ashes for many a dead and forgotten century.



The hotel we live in belonged to one of those great orders of knights of

the Cross in the times of the Crusades, and its mailed sentinels once

kept watch and ward in its massive turrets and woke the echoes of these

halls and corridors with their iron heels.



But Genoa's greatness has degenerated into an unostentatious commerce in

velvets and silver filagree-work.  They say that each European town has

its specialty.  These filagree things are Genoa's specialty.  Her smiths

take silver ingots and work them up into all manner of graceful and

beautiful forms.  They make bunches of flowers, from flakes and wires of

silver, that counterfeit the delicate creations the frost weaves upon a

windowpane; and we were shown a miniature silver temple whose fluted

columns, whose Corinthian capitals and rich entablatures, whose spire,

statues, bells, and ornate lavishness of sculpture were wrought in

polished silver, and with such matchless art that every detail was a

fascinating study and the finished edifice a wonder of beauty.



We are ready to move again, though we are not really tired yet of the

narrow passages of this old marble cave.  Cave is a good word--when

speaking of Genoa under the stars.  When we have been prowling at

midnight through the gloomy crevices they call streets, where no

footfalls but ours were echoing, where only ourselves were abroad, and

lights appeared only at long intervals and at a distance, and

mysteriously disappeared again, and the houses at our elbows seemed to

stretch upward farther than ever toward the heavens, the memory of a cave

I used to know at home was always in my mind, with its lofty passages,

its silence and solitude, its shrouding gloom, its sepulchral echoes, its

flitting lights, and more than all, its sudden revelations of branching

crevices and corridors where we least expected them.



We are not tired of the endless processions of cheerful, chattering

gossipers that throng these courts and streets all day long, either; nor

of the coarse-robed monks; nor of the "Asti" wines, which that old doctor

(whom we call the Oracle,) with customary felicity in the matter of

getting everything wrong, misterms "nasty."  But we must go,

nevertheless.



Our last sight was the cemetery (a burial place intended to accommodate

60,000 bodies,) and we shall continue to remember it after we shall have

forgotten the palaces.  It is a vast marble collonaded corridor extending

around a great unoccupied square of ground; its broad floor is marble,

and on every slab is an inscription--for every slab covers a corpse.  On

either side, as one walks down the middle of the passage, are monuments,

tombs, and sculptured figures that are exquisitely wrought and are full

of grace and beauty.  They are new and snowy; every outline is perfect,

every feature guiltless of mutilation, flaw, or blemish; and therefore,

to us these far-reaching ranks of bewitching forms are a hundred fold

more lovely than the damaged and dingy statuary they have saved from the

wreck of ancient art and set up in the galleries of Paris for the worship

of the world.



Well provided with cigars and other necessaries of life, we are now ready

to take the cars for Milan.









CHAPTER XVIII.



All day long we sped through a mountainous country whose peaks were

bright with sunshine, whose hillsides were dotted with pretty villas

sitting in the midst of gardens and shrubbery, and whose deep ravines

were cool and shady and looked ever so inviting from where we and the

birds were winging our flight through the sultry upper air.



We had plenty of chilly tunnels wherein to check our perspiration,

though.  We timed one of them.  We were twenty minutes passing through

it, going at the rate of thirty to thirty-five miles an hour.



Beyond Alessandria we passed the battle-field of Marengo.



Toward dusk we drew near Milan and caught glimpses of the city and the

blue mountain peaks beyond.  But we were not caring for these things--

they did not interest us in the least.  We were in a fever of impatience;

we were dying to see the renowned cathedral!  We watched--in this

direction and that--all around--everywhere.  We needed no one to point it

out--we did not wish any one to point it out--we would recognize it even

in the desert of the great Sahara.



At last, a forest of graceful needles, shimmering in the amber sunlight,

rose slowly above the pygmy housetops, as one sometimes sees, in the far

horizon, a gilded and pinnacled mass of cloud lift itself above the waste

of waves, at sea,--the Cathedral!  We knew it in a moment.



Half of that night, and all of the next day, this architectural autocrat

was our sole object of interest.



What a wonder it is!  So grand, so solemn, so vast!  And yet so delicate,

so airy, so graceful!  A very world of solid weight, and yet it seems in

the soft moonlight only a fairy delusion of frost-work that might vanish

with a breath!  How sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness of

spires were cut against the sky, and how richly their shadows fell upon

its snowy roof!  It was a vision!--a miracle!--an anthem sung in stone, a

poem wrought in marble!



Howsoever you look at the great cathedral, it is noble, it is beautiful!

Wherever you stand in Milan or within seven miles of Milan, it is visible

and when it is visible, no other object can chain your whole attention.

Leave your eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant and they

will surely turn to seek it.  It is the first thing you look for when you

rise in the morning, and the last your lingering gaze rests upon at

night.  Surely it must be the princeliest creation that ever brain of man

conceived.



At nine o'clock in the morning we went and stood before this marble

colossus.  The central one of its five great doors is bordered with a

bas-relief of birds and fruits and beasts and insects, which have been so

ingeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like living

creatures--and the figures are so numerous and the design so complex that

one might study it a week without exhausting its interest.  On the great

steeple--surmounting the myriad of spires--inside of the spires--over the

doors, the windows--in nooks and corners--every where that a niche or a

perch can be found about the enormous building, from summit to base,

there is a marble statue, and every statue is a study in itself!

Raphael, Angelo, Canova--giants like these gave birth to the designs, and

their own pupils carved them.  Every face is eloquent with expression,

and every attitude is full of grace.  Away above, on the lofty roof, rank

on rank of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air, and through

their rich tracery one sees the sky beyond.  In their midst the central

steeple towers proudly up like the mainmast of some great Indiaman among

a fleet of coasters.



We wished to go aloft.  The sacristan showed us a marble stairway (of

course it was marble, and of the purest and whitest--there is no other

stone, no brick, no wood, among its building materials) and told us to go

up one hundred and eighty-two steps and stop till he came.  It was not

necessary to say stop--we should have done that any how.  We were tired

by the time we got there.  This was the roof.  Here, springing from its

broad marble flagstones, were the long files of spires, looking very tall

close at hand, but diminishing in the distance like the pipes of an

organ.  We could see now that the statue on the top of each was the size

of a large man, though they all looked like dolls from the street.  We

could see, also, that from the inside of each and every one of these

hollow spires, from sixteen to thirty-one beautiful marble statues looked

out upon the world below.



From the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in endless succession

great curved marble beams, like the fore-and-aft braces of a steamboat,

and along each beam from end to end stood up a row of richly carved

flowers and fruits--each separate and distinct in kind, and over 15,000

species represented.  At a little distance these rows seem to close

together like the ties of a railroad track, and then the mingling

together of the buds and blossoms of this marble garden forms a picture

that is very charming to the eye.



We descended and entered.  Within the church, long rows of fluted

columns, like huge monuments, divided the building into broad aisles, and

on the figured pavement fell many a soft blush from the painted windows

above.  I knew the church was very large, but I could not fully

appreciate its great size until I noticed that the men standing far down

by the altar looked like boys, and seemed to glide, rather than walk.  We

loitered about gazing aloft at the monster windows all aglow with

brilliantly colored scenes in the lives of the Saviour and his followers.

Some of these pictures are mosaics, and so artistically are their

thousand particles of tinted glass or stone put together that the work

has all the smoothness and finish of a painting.  We counted sixty panes

of glass in one window, and each pane was adorned with one of these

master achievements of genius and patience.



The guide showed us a coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said was

considered to have come from the hand of Phidias, since it was not

possible that any other artist, of any epoch, could have copied nature

with such faultless accuracy.  The figure was that of a man without a

skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fiber and tendon and tissue

of the human frame represented in minute detail.  It looked natural,

because somehow it looked as if it were in pain.  A skinned man would be

likely to look that way unless his attention were occupied with some

other matter.  It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination

about it some where.  I am very sorry I saw it, because I shall always

see it now.  I shall dream of it sometimes.  I shall dream that it is

resting its corded arms on the bed's head and looking down on me with its

dead eyes; I shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets with me

and touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs.



It is hard to forget repulsive things.  I remember yet how I ran off from

school once, when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded

to climb into the window of my father's office and sleep on a lounge,

because I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed.  As I lay

on the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I

could see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor.  A

cold shiver went through me.  I turned my face to the wall.  That did not

answer.  I was afraid that that thing would creep over and seize me in

the dark.  I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes--they

seemed hours.  It appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never, never

would get to it.  I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass the

feverish time away.  I looked--the pale square was nearer.  I turned

again and counted fifty--it was almost touching it.  With desperate will

I turned again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in a

tremble.  A white human hand lay in the moonlight!  Such an awful sinking

at the heart--such a sudden gasp for breath!  I felt--I cannot tell what

I felt.  When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again.  But

no boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him.  I

counted again and looked--the most of a naked arm was exposed.  I put my

hands over my eyes and counted till I could stand it no longer, and then

--the pallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn

down, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death!  I raised to a sitting

posture and glowered on that corpse till the light crept down the bare

breastline by line--inch by inch--past the nipple--and then it disclosed

a ghastly stab!



I went away from there.  I do not say that I went away in any sort of a

hurry, but I simply went--that is sufficient.  I went out at the window,

and I carried the sash along with me.  I did not need the sash, but it

was handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it.--I was

not scared, but I was considerably agitated.



When I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it.  It seemed

perfectly delightful.  That man had been stabbed near the office that

afternoon, and they carried him in there to doctor him, but he only lived

an hour.  I have slept in the same room with him often since then--in my

dreams.



Now we will descend into the crypt, under the grand altar of Milan

Cathedral, and receive an impressive sermon from lips that have been

silent and hands that have been gestureless for three hundred years.



The priest stopped in a small dungeon and held up his candle.  This was

the last resting-place of a good man, a warm-hearted, unselfish man; a

man whose whole life was given to succoring the poor, encouraging the

faint-hearted, visiting the sick; in relieving distress, whenever and

wherever he found it.  His heart, his hand, and his purse were always

open.  With his story in one's mind he can almost see his benignant

countenance moving calmly among the haggard faces of Milan in the days

when the plague swept the city, brave where all others were cowards, full

of compassion where pity had been crushed out of all other breasts by the

instinct of self-preservation gone mad with terror, cheering all, praying

with all, helping all, with hand and brain and purse, at a time when

parents forsook their children, the friend deserted the friend, and the

brother turned away from the sister while her pleadings were still

wailing in his ears.



This was good St. Charles Borromeo, Bishop of Milan.  The people idolized

him; princes lavished uncounted treasures upon him.  We stood in his

tomb.  Near by was the sarcophagus, lighted by the dripping candles.  The

walls were faced with bas-reliefs representing scenes in his life done in

massive silver.  The priest put on a short white lace garment over his

black robe, crossed himself, bowed reverently, and began to turn a

windlass slowly.  The sarcophagus separated in two parts, lengthwise, and

the lower part sank down and disclosed a coffin of rock crystal as clear

as the atmosphere.  Within lay the body, robed in costly habiliments

covered with gold embroidery and starred with scintillating gems.  The

decaying head was black with age, the dry skin was drawn tight to the

bones, the eyes were gone, there was a hole in the temple and another in

the cheek, and the skinny lips were parted as in a ghastly smile!  Over

this dreadful face, its dust and decay and its mocking grin, hung a crown

sown thick with flashing brilliants; and upon the breast lay crosses and

croziers of solid gold that were splendid with emeralds and diamonds.



How poor, and cheap, and trivial these gew-gaws seemed in presence of the

solemnity, the grandeur, the awful majesty of Death!  Think of Milton,

Shakespeare, Washington, standing before a reverent world tricked out in

the glass beads, the brass ear-rings and tin trumpery of the savages of

the plains!



Dead Bartolomeo preached his pregnant sermon, and its burden was: You

that worship the vanities of earth--you that long for worldly honor,

worldly wealth, worldly fame--behold their worth!



To us it seemed that so good a man, so kind a heart, so simple a nature,

deserved rest and peace in a grave sacred from the intrusion of prying

eyes, and believed that he himself would have preferred to have it so,

but peradventure our wisdom was at fault in this regard.



As we came out upon the floor of the church again, another priest

volunteered to show us the treasures of the church.



What, more?  The furniture of the narrow chamber of death we had just

visited weighed six millions of francs in ounces and carats alone,

without a penny thrown into the account for the costly workmanship

bestowed upon them!  But we followed into a large room filled with tall

wooden presses like wardrobes.  He threw them open, and behold, the

cargoes of "crude bullion" of the assay offices of Nevada faded out of my

memory.  There were Virgins and bishops there, above their natural size,

made of solid silver, each worth, by weight, from eight hundred thousand

to two millions of francs, and bearing gemmed books in their hands worth

eighty thousand; there were bas-reliefs that weighed six hundred pounds,

carved in solid silver; croziers and crosses, and candlesticks six and

eight feet high, all of virgin gold, and brilliant with precious stones;

and beside these were all manner of cups and vases, and such things, rich

in proportion.  It was an Aladdin's palace.  The treasures here, by

simple weight, without counting workmanship, were valued at fifty

millions of francs!  If I could get the custody of them for a while, I

fear me the market price of silver bishops would advance shortly, on

account of their exceeding scarcity in the Cathedral of Milan.



The priests showed us two of St. Paul's fingers, and one of St. Peter's;

a bone of Judas Iscariot, (it was black,) and also bones of all the other

disciples; a handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression of

his face.  Among the most precious of the relics were a stone from the

Holy Sepulchre, part of the crown of thorns, (they have a whole one at

Notre Dame,) a fragment of the purple robe worn by the Saviour, a nail

from the Cross, and a picture of the Virgin and Child painted by the

veritable hand of St. Luke.  This is the second of St. Luke's Virgins we

have seen.  Once a year all these holy relics are carried in procession

through the streets of Milan.



I like to revel in the dryest details of the great cathedral.  The

building is five hundred feet long by one hundred and eighty wide, and

the principal steeple is in the neighborhood of four hundred feet high.

It has 7,148 marble statues, and will have upwards of three thousand more

when it is finished.  In addition it has one thousand five hundred bas-

reliefs.  It has one hundred and thirty-six spires--twenty-one more are

to be added.  Each spire is surmounted by a statue six and a half feet

high.  Every thing about the church is marble, and all from the same

quarry; it was bequeathed to the Archbishopric for this purpose centuries

ago.  So nothing but the mere workmanship costs; still that is expensive

--the bill foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions of francs thus

far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars,) and it is

estimated that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet to finish the

cathedral.  It looks complete, but is far from being so.  We saw a new

statue put in its niche yesterday, alongside of one which had been

standing these four hundred years, they said.  There are four staircases

leading up to the main steeple, each of which cost a hundred thousand

dollars, with the four hundred and eight statues which adorn them.  Marco

Compioni was the architect who designed the wonderful structure more than

five hundred years ago, and it took him forty-six years to work out the

plan and get it ready to hand over to the builders.  He is dead now.  The

building was begun a little less than five hundred years ago, and the

third generation hence will not see it completed.



The building looks best by moonlight, because the older portions of it,

being stained with age, contrast unpleasantly with the newer and whiter

portions.  It seems somewhat too broad for its height, but may be

familiarity with it might dissipate this impression.



They say that the Cathedral of Milan is second only to St. Peter's at

Rome.  I cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by human

hands.



We bid it good-bye, now--possibly for all time.  How surely, in some

future day, when the memory of it shall have lost its vividness, shall we

half believe we have seen it in a wonderful dream, but never with waking

eyes!









CHAPTER XIX.



"Do you wis zo haut can be?"



That was what the guide asked when we were looking up at the bronze

horses on the Arch of Peace.  It meant, do you wish to go up there?

I give it as a specimen of guide-English.  These are the people that make

life a burthen to the tourist.  Their tongues are never still.  They talk

forever and forever, and that is the kind of billingsgate they use.

Inspiration itself could hardly comprehend them.  If they would only show

you a masterpiece of art, or a venerable tomb, or a prison-house, or a

battle-field, hallowed by touching memories or historical reminiscences,

or grand traditions, and then step aside and hold still for ten minutes

and let you think, it would not be so bad.  But they interrupt every

dream, every pleasant train of thought, with their tiresome cackling.

Sometimes when I have been standing before some cherished old idol of

mine that I remembered years and years ago in pictures in the geography

at school, I have thought I would give a whole world if the human parrot

at my side would suddenly perish where he stood and leave me to gaze, and

ponder, and worship.



No, we did not "wis zo haut can be."  We wished to go to La Scala, the

largest theater in the world, I think they call it.  We did so.  It was a

large place.  Seven separate and distinct masses of humanity--six great

circles and a monster parquette.



We wished to go to the Ambrosian Library, and we did that also.  We saw a

manuscript of Virgil, with annotations in the handwriting of Petrarch,

the gentleman who loved another man's Laura, and lavished upon her all

through life a love which was a clear waste of the raw material.  It was

sound sentiment, but bad judgment.  It brought both parties fame, and

created a fountain of commiseration for them in sentimental breasts that

is running yet.  But who says a word in behalf of poor Mr. Laura?  (I do

not know his other name.)  Who glorifies him?  Who bedews him with tears?

Who writes poetry about him?  Nobody.  How do you suppose he liked the

state of things that has given the world so much pleasure?  How did he

enjoy having another man following his wife every where and making her

name a familiar word in every garlic-exterminating mouth in Italy with

his sonnets to her pre-empted eyebrows?  They got fame and sympathy--he

got neither.  This is a peculiarly felicitous instance of what is called

poetical justice.  It is all very fine; but it does not chime with my

notions of right.  It is too one-sided--too ungenerous.



Let the world go on fretting about Laura and Petrarch if it will; but as

for me, my tears and my lamentations shall be lavished upon the unsung

defendant.



We saw also an autograph letter of Lucrezia Borgia, a lady for whom I

have always entertained the highest respect, on account of her rare

histrionic capabilities, her opulence in solid gold goblets made of

gilded wood, her high distinction as an operatic screamer, and the

facility with which she could order a sextuple funeral and get the

corpses ready for it.  We saw one single coarse yellow hair from

Lucrezia's head, likewise.  It awoke emotions, but we still live.  In

this same library we saw some drawings by Michael Angelo (these Italians

call him Mickel Angelo,) and Leonardo da Vinci.  (They spell it Vinci and

pronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they pronounce.)

We reserve our opinion of these sketches.



In another building they showed us a fresco representing some lions and

other beasts drawing chariots; and they seemed to project so far from the

wall that we took them to be sculptures.  The artist had shrewdly

heightened the delusion by painting dust on the creatures' backs, as if

it had fallen there naturally and properly.  Smart fellow--if it be smart

to deceive strangers.



Elsewhere we saw a huge Roman amphitheatre, with its stone seats still in

good preservation.  Modernized, it is now the scene of more peaceful

recreations than the exhibition of a party of wild beasts with Christians

for dinner.  Part of the time, the Milanese use it for a race track, and

at other seasons they flood it with water and have spirited yachting

regattas there.  The guide told us these things, and he would hardly try

so hazardous an experiment as the telling of a falsehood, when it is all

he can do to speak the truth in English without getting the lock-jaw.



In another place we were shown a sort of summer arbor, with a fence

before it.  We said that was nothing.  We looked again, and saw, through

the arbor, an endless stretch of garden, and shrubbery, and grassy lawn.

We were perfectly willing to go in there and rest, but it could not be

done.  It was only another delusion--a painting by some ingenious artist

with little charity in his heart for tired folk.  The deception was

perfect.  No one could have imagined the park was not real.  We even

thought we smelled the flowers at first.



We got a carriage at twilight and drove in the shaded avenues with the

other nobility, and after dinner we took wine and ices in a fine garden

with the great public.  The music was excellent, the flowers and

shrubbery were pleasant to the eye, the scene was vivacious, everybody

was genteel and well-behaved, and the ladies were slightly moustached,

and handsomely dressed, but very homely.



We adjourned to a cafe and played billiards an hour, and I made six or

seven points by the doctor pocketing his ball, and he made as many by my

pocketing my ball.  We came near making a carom sometimes, but not the

one we were trying to make.  The table was of the usual European style--

cushions dead and twice as high as the balls; the cues in bad repair.

The natives play only a sort of pool on them.  We have never seen any

body playing the French three-ball game yet, and I doubt if there is any

such game known in France, or that there lives any man mad enough to try

to play it on one of these European tables.  We had to stop playing

finally because Dan got to sleeping fifteen minutes between the counts

and paying no attention to his marking.



Afterward we walked up and down one of the most popular streets for some

time, enjoying other people's comfort and wishing we could export some of

it to our restless, driving, vitality-consuming marts at home.  Just in

this one matter lies the main charm of life in Europe--comfort.  In

America, we hurry--which is well; but when the day's work is done, we go

on thinking of losses and gains, we plan for the morrow, we even carry

our business cares to bed with us, and toss and worry over them when we

ought to be restoring our racked bodies and brains with sleep.  We burn

up our energies with these excitements, and either die early or drop into

a lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a man's prime

in Europe.  When an acre of ground has produced long and well, we let it

lie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear across the

continent in the same coach he started in--the coach is stabled somewhere

on the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool for a few days;

when a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold an edge, the

barber lays it away for a few weeks, and the edge comes back of its own

accord.  We bestow thoughtful care upon inanimate objects, but none upon

ourselves.  What a robust people, what a nation of thinkers we might be,

if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf occasionally and renew our

edges!



I do envy these Europeans the comfort they take.  When the work of the

day is done, they forget it.  Some of them go, with wife and children, to

a beer hall and sit quietly and genteelly drinking a mug or two of ale

and listening to music; others walk the streets, others drive in the

avenues; others assemble in the great ornamental squares in the early

evening to enjoy the sight and the fragrance of flowers and to hear the

military bands play--no European city being without its fine military

music at eventide; and yet others of the populace sit in the open air in

front of the refreshment houses and eat ices and drink mild beverages

that could not harm a child.  They go to bed moderately early, and sleep

well.  They are always quiet, always orderly, always cheerful,

comfortable, and appreciative of life and its manifold blessings.  One

never sees a drunken man among them.  The change that has come over our

little party is surprising.  Day by day we lose some of our restlessness

and absorb some of the spirit of quietude and ease that is in the

tranquil atmosphere about us and in the demeanor of the people.  We grow

wise apace.  We begin to comprehend what life is for.



We have had a bath in Milan, in a public bath-house.  They were going to

put all three of us in one bath-tub, but we objected.  Each of us had an

Italian farm on his back.  We could have felt affluent if we had been

officially surveyed and fenced in.  We chose to have three bathtubs, and

large ones--tubs suited to the dignity of aristocrats who had real

estate, and brought it with them.  After we were stripped and had taken

the first chilly dash, we discovered that haunting atrocity that has

embittered our lives in so many cities and villages of Italy and France--

there was no soap.  I called.  A woman answered, and I barely had time to

throw myself against the door--she would have been in, in another second.

I said:



"Beware, woman!  Go away from here--go away, now, or it will be the worse

for you.  I am an unprotected male, but I will preserve my honor at the

peril of my life!"



These words must have frightened her, for she skurried away very fast.



Dan's voice rose on the air:



"Oh, bring some soap, why don't you!"



The reply was Italian.  Dan resumed:



"Soap, you know--soap.  That is what I want--soap.  S-o-a-p, soap; s-o-p-

e, soap; s-o-u-p, soap.  Hurry up!  I don't know how you Irish spell it,

but I want it.  Spell it to suit yourself, but fetch it.  I'm freezing."



I heard the doctor say impressively:



"Dan, how often have we told you that these foreigners cannot understand

English?  Why will you not depend upon us?  Why will you not tell us what

you want, and let us ask for it in the language of the country?  It would

save us a great deal of the humiliation your reprehensible ignorance

causes us.  I will address this person in his mother tongue: 'Here,

cospetto!  corpo di Bacco!  Sacramento!  Solferino!--Soap, you son of a

gun!'  Dan, if you would let us talk for you, you would never expose your

ignorant vulgarity."



Even this fluent discharge of Italian did not bring the soap at once, but

there was a good reason for it.  There was not such an article about the

establishment.  It is my belief that there never had been.  They had to

send far up town, and to several different places before they finally got

it, so they said.  We had to wait twenty or thirty minutes.  The same

thing had occurred the evening before, at the hotel.  I think I have

divined the reason for this state of things at last.  The English know

how to travel comfortably, and they carry soap with them; other

foreigners do not use the article.



At every hotel we stop at we always have to send out for soap, at the

last moment, when we are grooming ourselves for dinner, and they put it

in the bill along with the candles and other nonsense.  In Marseilles

they make half the fancy toilet soap we consume in America, but the

Marseillaise only have a vague theoretical idea of its use, which they

have obtained from books of travel, just as they have acquired an

uncertain notion of clean shirts, and the peculiarities of the gorilla,

and other curious matters.  This reminds me of poor Blucher's note to the

landlord in Paris:



     PARIS, le 7 Juillet.  Monsieur le Landlord--Sir: Pourquoi don't you

     mettez some savon in your bed-chambers?  Est-ce que vous pensez I

     will steal it?  La nuit passee you charged me pour deux chandelles

     when I only had one; hier vous avez charged me avec glace when I had

     none at all; tout les jours you are coming some fresh game or other

     on me, mais vous ne pouvez pas play this savon dodge on me twice.

     Savon is a necessary de la vie to any body but a Frenchman, et je

     l'aurai hors de cet hotel or make trouble.  You hear me.  Allons.

     BLUCHER.



I remonstrated against the sending of this note, because it was so mixed

up that the landlord would never be able to make head or tail of it; but

Blucher said he guessed the old man could read the French of it and

average the rest.



Blucher's French is bad enough, but it is not much worse than the English

one finds in advertisements all over Italy every day.  For instance,

observe the printed card of the hotel we shall probably stop at on the

shores of Lake Como:



     "NOTISH."



     "This hotel which the best it is in Italy and most superb, is

     handsome locate on the best situation of the lake, with the most

     splendid view near the Villas Melzy, to the King of Belgian, and

     Serbelloni.  This hotel have recently enlarge, do offer all

     commodities on moderate price, at the strangers gentlemen who whish

     spend the seasons on the Lake Come."



How is that, for a specimen?  In the hotel is a handsome little chapel

where an English clergyman is employed to preach to such of the guests of

the house as hail from England and America, and this fact is also set

forth in barbarous English in the same advertisement.  Wouldn't you have

supposed that the adventurous linguist who framed the card would have

known enough to submit it to that clergyman before he sent it to the

printer?



Here in Milan, in an ancient tumble-down ruin of a church, is the

mournful wreck of the most celebrated painting in the world--"The Last

Supper," by Leonardo da Vinci.  We are not infallible judges of pictures,

but of course we went there to see this wonderful painting, once so

beautiful, always so worshipped by masters in art, and forever to be

famous in song and story.  And the first thing that occurred was the

infliction on us of a placard fairly reeking with wretched English.  Take

a morsel of it: "Bartholomew (that is the first figure on the left hand

side at the spectator,) uncertain and doubtful about what he thinks to

have heard, and upon which he wants to be assured by himself at Christ

and by no others."



Good, isn't it?  And then Peter is described as "argumenting in a

threatening and angrily condition at Judas Iscariot."



This paragraph recalls the picture.  "The Last Supper" is painted on the

dilapidated wall of what was a little chapel attached to the main church

in ancient times, I suppose.  It is battered and scarred in every

direction, and stained and discolored by time, and Napoleon's horses

kicked the legs off most the disciples when they (the horses, not the

disciples,) were stabled there more than half a century ago.



I recognized the old picture in a moment--the Saviour with bowed head

seated at the centre of a long, rough table with scattering fruits and

dishes upon it, and six disciples on either side in their long robes,

talking to each other--the picture from which all engravings and all

copies have been made for three centuries.  Perhaps no living man has

ever known an attempt to paint the Lord's Supper differently.  The world

seems to have become settled in the belief, long ago, that it is not

possible for human genius to outdo this creation of da Vinci's.  I

suppose painters will go on copying it as long as any of the original is

left visible to the eye.  There were a dozen easels in the room, and as

many artists transferring the great picture to their canvases.  Fifty

proofs of steel engravings and lithographs were scattered around, too.

And as usual, I could not help noticing how superior the copies were to

the original, that is, to my inexperienced eye.  Wherever you find a

Raphael, a Rubens, a Michelangelo, a Carracci, or a da Vinci (and we see

them every day,) you find artists copying them, and the copies are always

the handsomest.  Maybe the originals were handsome when they were new,

but they are not now.



This picture is about thirty feet long, and ten or twelve high, I should

think, and the figures are at least life size.  It is one of the largest

paintings in Europe.



The colors are dimmed with age; the countenances are scaled and marred,

and nearly all expression is gone from them; the hair is a dead blur upon

the wall, and there is no life in the eyes.  Only the attitudes are

certain.



People come here from all parts of the world, and glorify this

masterpiece.  They stand entranced before it with bated breath and parted

lips, and when they speak, it is only in the catchy ejaculations of

rapture:



"Oh, wonderful!"



"Such expression!"



"Such grace of attitude!"



"Such dignity!"



"Such faultless drawing!"



"Such matchless coloring!"



"Such feeling!"



"What delicacy of touch!"



"What sublimity of conception!"



"A vision!  A vision!"



I only envy these people; I envy them their honest admiration, if it be

honest--their delight, if they feel delight.  I harbor no animosity

toward any of them.  But at the same time the thought will intrude itself

upon me, How can they see what is not visible?  What would you think of a

man who looked at some decayed, blind, toothless, pock-marked Cleopatra,

and said: "What matchless beauty!  What soul!  What expression!"  What

would you think of a man who gazed upon a dingy, foggy sunset, and said:

"What sublimity!  What feeling!  What richness of coloring!"  What would

you think of a man who stared in ecstasy upon a desert of stumps and

said: "Oh, my soul, my beating heart, what a noble forest is here!"



You would think that those men had an astonishing talent for seeing

things that had already passed away.  It was what I thought when I stood

before "The Last Supper" and heard men apostrophizing wonders, and

beauties and perfections which had faded out of the picture and gone, a

hundred years before they were born.  We can imagine the beauty that was

once in an aged face; we can imagine the forest if we see the stumps; but

we can not absolutely see these things when they are not there.  I am

willing to believe that the eye of the practiced artist can rest upon the

Last Supper and renew a lustre where only a hint of it is left, supply a

tint that has faded away, restore an expression that is gone; patch, and

color, and add, to the dull canvas until at last its figures shall stand

before him aglow with the life, the feeling, the freshness, yea, with all

the noble beauty that was theirs when first they came from the hand of

the master.  But I can not work this miracle.  Can those other uninspired

visitors do it, or do they only happily imagine they do?



After reading so much about it, I am satisfied that the Last Supper was a

very miracle of art once.  But it was three hundred years ago.



It vexes me to hear people talk so glibly of "feeling," "expression,"

"tone," and those other easily acquired and inexpensive technicalities of

art that make such a fine show in conversations concerning pictures.

There is not one man in seventy-five hundred that can tell what a

pictured face is intended to express.  There is not one man in five

hundred that can go into a court-room and be sure that he will not

mistake some harmless innocent of a juryman for the black-hearted

assassin on trial.  Yet such people talk of "character" and presume to

interpret "expression" in pictures.  There is an old story that Matthews,

the actor, was once lauding the ability of the human face to express the

passions and emotions hidden in the breast.  He said the countenance

could disclose what was passing in the heart plainer than the tongue

could.



"Now," he said, "observe my face--what does it express?"



"Despair!"



"Bah, it expresses peaceful resignation!  What does this express?"



"Rage!"



"Stuff!  It means terror!  This!"



"Imbecility!"



"Fool!  It is smothered ferocity!  Now this!"



"Joy!"



"Oh, perdition!  Any ass can see it means insanity!"



Expression!  People coolly pretend to read it who would think themselves

presumptuous if they pretended to interpret the hieroglyphics on the

obelisks of Luxor--yet they are fully as competent to do the one thing as

the other.  I have heard two very intelligent critics speak of Murillo's

Immaculate Conception (now in the museum at Seville,) within the past few

days.  One said:



"Oh, the Virgin's face is full of the ecstasy of a joy that is complete--

that leaves nothing more to be desired on earth!"



The other said:



"Ah, that wonderful face is so humble, so pleading--it says as plainly as

words could say it: 'I fear; I tremble; I am unworthy.  But Thy will be

done; sustain Thou Thy servant!'"



The reader can see the picture in any drawing-room; it can be easily

recognized: the Virgin (the only young and really beautiful Virgin that

was ever painted by one of the old masters, some of us think,) stands in

the crescent of the new moon, with a multitude of cherubs hovering about

her, and more coming; her hands are crossed upon her breast, and upon her

uplifted countenance falls a glory out of the heavens.  The reader may

amuse himself, if he chooses, in trying to determine which of these

gentlemen read the Virgin's "expression" aright, or if either of them did

it.



Any one who is acquainted with the old masters will comprehend how much

"The Last Supper" is damaged when I say that the spectator can not really

tell, now, whether the disciples are Hebrews or Italians.  These ancient

painters never succeeded in denationalizing themselves.  The Italian

artists painted Italian Virgins, the Dutch painted Dutch Virgins, the

Virgins of the French painters were Frenchwomen--none of them ever put

into the face of the Madonna that indescribable something which proclaims

the Jewess, whether you find her in New York, in Constantinople, in

Paris, Jerusalem, or in the empire of Morocco.  I saw in the Sandwich

Islands, once, a picture copied by a talented German artist from an

engraving in one of the American illustrated papers.  It was an allegory,

representing Mr. Davis in the act of signing a secession act or some such

document.  Over him hovered the ghost of Washington in warning attitude,

and in the background a troop of shadowy soldiers in Continental uniform

were limping with shoeless, bandaged feet through a driving snow-storm.

Valley Forge was suggested, of course.  The copy seemed accurate, and yet

there was a discrepancy somewhere.  After a long examination I discovered

what it was--the shadowy soldiers were all Germans!  Jeff Davis was a

German!  even the hovering ghost was a German ghost!  The artist had

unconsciously worked his nationality into the picture.  To tell the

truth, I am getting a little perplexed about John the Baptist and his

portraits.  In France I finally grew reconciled to him as a Frenchman;

here he is unquestionably an Italian.  What next?  Can it be possible

that the painters make John the Baptist a Spaniard in Madrid and an

Irishman in Dublin?



We took an open barouche and drove two miles out of Milan to "see ze

echo," as the guide expressed it.  The road was smooth, it was bordered

by trees, fields, and grassy meadows, and the soft air was filled with

the odor of flowers.  Troops of picturesque peasant girls, coming from

work, hooted at us, shouted at us, made all manner of game of us, and

entirely delighted me.  My long-cherished judgment was confirmed.  I

always did think those frowsy, romantic, unwashed peasant girls I had

read so much about in poetry were a glaring fraud.



We enjoyed our jaunt.  It was an exhilarating relief from tiresome sight-

seeing.



We distressed ourselves very little about the astonishing echo the guide

talked so much about.  We were growing accustomed to encomiums on wonders

that too often proved no wonders at all.  And so we were most happily

disappointed to find in the sequel that the guide had even failed to rise

to the magnitude of his subject.



We arrived at a tumble-down old rookery called the Palazzo Simonetti--a

massive hewn-stone affair occupied by a family of ragged Italians.

A good-looking young girl conducted us to a window on the second floor

which looked out on a court walled on three sides by tall buildings.  She

put her head out at the window and shouted.  The echo answered more times

than we could count.  She took a speaking trumpet and through it she

shouted, sharp and quick, a single "Ha!"  The echo answered:



"Ha!--ha!----ha!--ha!--ha!-ha!  ha!  h-a-a-a-a-a!" and finally went off

into a rollicking convulsion of the jolliest laughter that could be

imagined.  It was so joyful--so long continued--so perfectly cordial and

hearty, that every body was forced to join in.  There was no resisting

it.



Then the girl took a gun and fired it.  We stood ready to count the

astonishing clatter of reverberations.  We could not say one, two, three,

fast enough, but we could dot our notebooks with our pencil points almost

rapidly enough to take down a sort of short-hand report of the result.

My page revealed the following account.  I could not keep up, but I did

as well as I could.



I set down fifty-two distinct repetitions, and then the echo got the

advantage of me.  The doctor set down sixty-four, and thenceforth the

echo moved too fast for him, also.  After the separate concussions could

no longer be noted, the reverberations dwindled to a wild, long-sustained

clatter of sounds such as a watchman's rattle produces.  It is likely

that this is the most remarkable echo in the world.



The doctor, in jest, offered to kiss the young girl, and was taken a

little aback when she said he might for a franc!  The commonest gallantry

compelled him to stand by his offer, and so he paid the franc and took

the kiss.  She was a philosopher.  She said a franc was a good thing to

have, and she did not care any thing for one paltry kiss, because she had

a million left.  Then our comrade, always a shrewd businessman, offered

to take the whole cargo at thirty days, but that little financial scheme

was a failure.









CHAPTER XX.



We left Milan by rail.  The Cathedral six or seven miles behind us; vast,

dreamy, bluish, snow-clad mountains twenty miles in front of us,--these

were the accented points in the scenery.  The more immediate scenery

consisted of fields and farm-houses outside the car and a monster-headed

dwarf and a moustached woman inside it.  These latter were not show-

people.  Alas, deformity and female beards are too common in Italy to

attract attention.



We passed through a range of wild, picturesque hills, steep, wooded,

cone-shaped, with rugged crags projecting here and there, and with

dwellings and ruinous castles perched away up toward the drifting clouds.

We lunched at the curious old town of Como, at the foot of the lake, and

then took the small steamer and had an afternoon's pleasure excursion to

this place,--Bellaggio.



When we walked ashore, a party of policemen (people whose cocked hats and

showy uniforms would shame the finest uniform in the military service of

the United States,) put us into a little stone cell and locked us in.  We

had the whole passenger list for company, but their room would have been

preferable, for there was no light, there were no windows, no

ventilation.  It was close and hot.  We were much crowded.  It was the

Black Hole of Calcutta on a small scale.  Presently a smoke rose about

our feet--a smoke that smelled of all the dead things of earth, of all

the putrefaction and corruption imaginable.



We were there five minutes, and when we got out it was hard to tell which

of us carried the vilest fragrance.



These miserable outcasts called that "fumigating" us, and the term was a

tame one indeed.  They fumigated us to guard themselves against the

cholera, though we hailed from no infected port.  We had left the cholera

far behind us all the time.  However, they must keep epidemics away

somehow or other, and fumigation is cheaper than soap.  They must either

wash themselves or fumigate other people.  Some of the lower classes had

rather die than wash, but the fumigation of strangers causes them no

pangs.  They need no fumigation themselves.  Their habits make it

unnecessary.  They carry their preventive with them; they sweat and

fumigate all the day long.  I trust I am a humble and a consistent

Christian.  I try to do what is right.  I know it is my duty to "pray for

them that despitefully use me;" and therefore, hard as it is, I shall

still try to pray for these fumigating, maccaroni-stuffing organ-

grinders.



Our hotel sits at the water's edge--at least its front garden does--and

we walk among the shrubbery and smoke at twilight; we look afar off at

Switzerland and the Alps, and feel an indolent willingness to look no

closer; we go down the steps and swim in the lake; we take a shapely

little boat and sail abroad among the reflections of the stars; lie on

the thwarts and listen to the distant laughter, the singing, the soft

melody of flutes and guitars that comes floating across the water from

pleasuring gondolas; we close the evening with exasperating billiards on

one of those same old execrable tables.  A midnight luncheon in our ample

bed-chamber; a final smoke in its contracted veranda facing the water,

the gardens, and the mountains; a summing up of the day's events.  Then

to bed, with drowsy brains harassed with a mad panorama that mixes up

pictures of France, of Italy, of the ship, of the ocean, of home, in

grotesque and bewildering disorder.  Then a melting away of familiar

faces, of cities, and of tossing waves, into a great calm of

forgetfulness and peace.



After which, the nightmare.



Breakfast in the morning, and then the lake.



I did not like it yesterday.  I thought Lake Tahoe was much finer.

I have to confess now, however, that my judgment erred somewhat, though

not extravagantly.  I always had an idea that Como was a vast basin of

water, like Tahoe, shut in by great mountains.  Well, the border of huge

mountains is here, but the lake itself is not a basin.  It is as crooked

as any brook, and only from one-quarter to two-thirds as wide as the

Mississippi.  There is not a yard of low ground on either side of it--

nothing but endless chains of mountains that spring abruptly from the

water's edge and tower to altitudes varying from a thousand to two

thousand feet.  Their craggy sides are clothed with vegetation, and white

specks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage everywhere; they are

even perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a thousand feet above

your head.



Again, for miles along the shores, handsome country seats, surrounded by

gardens and groves, sit fairly in the water, sometimes in nooks carved by

Nature out of the vine-hung precipices, and with no ingress or egress

save by boats.  Some have great broad stone staircases leading down to

the water, with heavy stone balustrades ornamented with statuary and

fancifully adorned with creeping vines and bright-colored flowers--for

all the world like a drop curtain in a theatre, and lacking nothing but

long-waisted, high-heeled women and plumed gallants in silken tights

coming down to go serenading in the splendid gondola in waiting.



A great feature of Como's attractiveness is the multitude of pretty

houses and gardens that cluster upon its shores and on its mountain

sides.  They look so snug and so homelike, and at eventide when every

thing seems to slumber, and the music of the vesper bells comes stealing

over the water, one almost believes that nowhere else than on the lake of

Como can there be found such a paradise of tranquil repose.



From my window here in Bellaggio, I have a view of the other side of the

lake now, which is as beautiful as a picture.  A scarred and wrinkled

precipice rises to a height of eighteen hundred feet; on a tiny bench

half way up its vast wall, sits a little snowflake of a church, no bigger

than a martin-box, apparently; skirting the base of the cliff are a

hundred orange groves and gardens, flecked with glimpses of the white

dwellings that are buried in them; in front, three or four gondolas lie

idle upon the water--and in the burnished mirror of the lake, mountain,

chapel, houses, groves and boats are counterfeited so brightly and so

clearly that one scarce knows where the reality leaves off and the

reflection begins!



The surroundings of this picture are fine.  A mile away, a grove-plumed

promontory juts far into the lake and glasses its palace in the blue

depths; in midstream a boat is cutting the shining surface and leaving a

long track behind, like a ray of light; the mountains beyond are veiled

in a dreamy purple haze; far in the opposite direction a tumbled mass of

domes and verdant slopes and valleys bars the lake, and here indeed does

distance lend enchantment to the view--for on this broad canvas, sun and

clouds and the richest of atmospheres have blended a thousand tints

together, and over its surface the filmy lights and shadows drift, hour

after hour, and glorify it with a beauty that seems reflected out of

Heaven itself.  Beyond all question, this is the most voluptuous scene we

have yet looked upon.



Last night the scenery was striking and picturesque.  On the other side

crags and trees and snowy houses were reflected in the lake with a

wonderful distinctness, and streams of light from many a distant window

shot far abroad over the still waters.  On this side, near at hand, great

mansions, white with moonlight, glared out from the midst of masses of

foliage that lay black and shapeless in the shadows that fell from the

cliff above--and down in the margin of the lake every feature of the

weird vision was faithfully repeated.



Today we have idled through a wonder of a garden attached to a ducal

estate--but enough of description is enough, I judge.



I suspect that this was the same place the gardener's son deceived the

Lady of Lyons with, but I do not know.  You may have heard of the passage

somewhere:



          "A deep vale,

          Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world,

          Near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold

          And whispering myrtles:

          Glassing softest skies, cloudless,

          Save with rare and roseate shadows;

          A palace, lifting to eternal heaven its marbled walls,

          From out a glossy bower of coolest foliage musical with birds."



That is all very well, except the "clear" part of the lake.  It certainly

is clearer than a great many lakes, but how dull its waters are compared

with the wonderful transparence of Lake Tahoe!  I speak of the north

shore of Tahoe, where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of a

hundred and eighty feet.  I have tried to get this statement off at par

here, but with no success; so I have been obliged to negotiate it at

fifty percent discount.  At this rate I find some takers; perhaps the

reader will receive it on the same terms--ninety feet instead of one

hundred and eighty.  But let it be remembered that those are forced

terms--Sheriff's sale prices.  As far as I am privately concerned, I

abate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangely

magnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout (a trout of the

large kind,) at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet--may see every

pebble on the bottom--might even count a paper of dray-pins.  People talk

of the transparent waters of the Mexican Bay of Acapulco, but in my own

experience I know they cannot compare with those I am speaking of.  I

have fished for trout, in Tahoe, and at a measured depth of eighty-four

feet I have seen them put their noses to the bait and I could see their

gills open and shut.  I could hardly have seen the trout themselves at

that distance in the open air.



As I go back in spirit and recall that noble sea, reposing among the

snow-peaks six thousand feet above the ocean, the conviction comes strong

upon me again that Como would only seem a bedizened little courtier in

that august presence.



Sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to

year permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen!  Tahoe!  It suggests

no crystal waters, no picturesque shores, no sublimity.  Tahoe for a sea

in the clouds: a sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms at

times, at times in savage storms; a sea whose royal seclusion is guarded

by a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand

feet above the level world; a sea whose every aspect is impressive, whose

belongings are all beautiful, whose lonely majesty types the Deity!



Tahoe means grasshoppers.  It means grasshopper soup.  It is Indian, and

suggestive of Indians.  They say it is Pi-ute--possibly it is Digger.

I am satisfied it was named by the Diggers--those degraded savages who

roast their dead relatives, then mix the human grease and ashes of bones

with tar, and "gaum" it thick all over their heads and foreheads and

ears, and go caterwauling about the hills and call it mourning.  These

are the gentry that named the Lake.



People say that Tahoe means "Silver Lake"--"Limpid Water"--"Falling

Leaf."  Bosh.  It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the Digger

tribe,--and of the Pi-utes as well.  It isn't worth while, in these

practical times, for people to talk about Indian poetry--there never was

any in them--except in the Fenimore Cooper Indians.  But they are an

extinct tribe that never existed.  I know the Noble Red Man.  I have

camped with the Indians; I have been on the warpath with them, taken part

in the chase with them--for grasshoppers; helped them steal cattle; I

have roamed with them, scalped them, had them for breakfast.  I would

gladly eat the whole race if I had a chance.



But I am growing unreliable.  I will return to my comparison of the

lakes.  Como is a little deeper than Tahoe, if people here tell the

truth.  They say it is eighteen hundred feet deep at this point, but it

does not look a dead enough blue for that.  Tahoe is one thousand five

hundred and twenty-five feet deep in the centre, by the state geologist's

measurement.  They say the great peak opposite this town is five thousand

feet high: but I feel sure that three thousand feet of that statement is

a good honest lie.  The lake is a mile wide, here, and maintains about

that width from this point to its northern extremity--which is distant

sixteen miles: from here to its southern extremity--say fifteen miles--it

is not over half a mile wide in any place, I should think.  Its snow-clad

mountains one hears so much about are only seen occasionally, and then in

the distance, the Alps.  Tahoe is from ten to eighteen miles wide, and

its mountains shut it in like a wall.  Their summits are never free from

snow the year round.  One thing about it is very strange: it never has

even a skim of ice upon its surface, although lakes in the same range of

mountains, lying in a lower and warmer temperature, freeze over in

winter.



It is cheerful to meet a shipmate in these out-of-the-way places and

compare notes with him.  We have found one of ours here--an old soldier

of the war, who is seeking bloodless adventures and rest from his

campaigns in these sunny lands.--[Colonel J.  HERON FOSTER, editor of a

Pittsburgh journal, and a most estimable gentleman.  As these sheets are

being prepared for the press I am pained to learn of his decease shortly

after his return home--M.T.]--









CHAPTER XXI.



We voyaged by steamer down the Lago di Lecco, through wild mountain

scenery, and by hamlets and villas, and disembarked at the town of Lecco.

They said it was two hours, by carriage to the ancient city of Bergamo,

and that we would arrive there in good season for the railway train.  We

got an open barouche and a wild, boisterous driver, and set out.  It was

delightful.  We had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road.  There were

towering cliffs on our left, and the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right,

and every now and then it rained on us.  Just before starting, the driver

picked up, in the street, a stump of a cigar an inch long, and put it in

his mouth.  When he had carried it thus about an hour, I thought it would

be only Christian charity to give him a light.  I handed him my cigar,

which I had just lit, and he put it in his mouth and returned his stump

to his pocket!  I never saw a more sociable man.  At least I never saw a

man who was more sociable on a short acquaintance.



We saw interior Italy, now.  The houses were of solid stone, and not

often in good repair.  The peasants and their children were idle, as a

general thing, and the donkeys and chickens made themselves at home in

drawing-room and bed-chamber and were not molested.  The drivers of each

and every one of the slow-moving market-carts we met were stretched in

the sun upon their merchandise, sound a sleep.  Every three or four

hundred yards, it seemed to me, we came upon the shrine of some saint or

other--a rude picture of him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar by

the road-side.--Some of the pictures of the Saviour were curiosities in

their way.  They represented him stretched upon the cross, his

countenance distorted with agony.  From the wounds of the crown of

thorns; from the pierced side; from the mutilated hands and feet; from

the scourged body--from every hand-breadth of his person streams of blood

were flowing!  Such a gory, ghastly spectacle would frighten the children

out of their senses, I should think.  There were some unique auxiliaries

to the painting which added to its spirited effect.  These were genuine

wooden and iron implements, and were prominently disposed round about the

figure: a bundle of nails; the hammer to drive them; the sponge; the reed

that supported it; the cup of vinegar; the ladder for the ascent of the

cross; the spear that pierced the Saviour's side.  The crown of thorns

was made of real thorns, and was nailed to the sacred head.  In some

Italian church-paintings, even by the old masters, the Saviour and the

Virgin wear silver or gilded crowns that are fastened to the pictured

head with nails.  The effect is as grotesque as it is incongruous.



Here and there, on the fronts of roadside inns, we found huge, coarse

frescoes of suffering martyrs like those in the shrines.  It could not

have diminished their sufferings any to be so uncouthly represented.

We were in the heart and home of priest craft--of a happy, cheerful,

contented ignorance, superstition, degradation, poverty, indolence, and

everlasting unaspiring worthlessness.  And we said fervently: it suits

these people precisely; let them enjoy it, along with the other animals,

and Heaven forbid that they be molested.  We feel no malice toward these

fumigators.



We passed through the strangest, funniest, undreampt-of old towns, wedded

to the customs and steeped in the dreams of the elder ages, and perfectly

unaware that the world turns round!  And perfectly indifferent, too, as

to whether it turns around or stands still.  They have nothing to do but

eat and sleep and sleep and eat, and toil a little when they can get a

friend to stand by and keep them awake.  They are not paid for thinking--

they are not paid to fret about the world's concerns.  They were not

respectable people--they were not worthy people--they were not learned

and wise and brilliant people--but in their breasts, all their stupid

lives long, resteth a peace that passeth understanding!  How can men,

calling themselves men, consent to be so degraded and happy.



We whisked by many a gray old medieval castle, clad thick with ivy that

swung its green banners down from towers and turrets where once some old

Crusader's flag had floated.  The driver pointed to one of these ancient

fortresses, and said, (I translate):



"Do you see that great iron hook that projects from the wall just under

the highest window in the ruined tower?"



We said we could not see it at such a distance, but had no doubt it was

there.



"Well," he said; "there is a legend connected with that iron hook.

Nearly seven hundred years ago, that castle was the property of the noble

Count Luigi Gennaro Guido Alphonso di Genova----"



"What was his other name?"  said Dan.



"He had no other name.  The name I have spoken was all the name he had.

He was the son of----"



"Poor but honest parents--that is all right--never mind the particulars--

go on with the legend."



                               THE LEGEND.



Well, then, all the world, at that time, was in a wild excitement about

the Holy Sepulchre.  All the great feudal lords in Europe were pledging

their lands and pawning their plate to fit out men-at-arms so that they

might join the grand armies of Christendom and win renown in the Holy

Wars.  The Count Luigi raised money, like the rest, and one mild

September morning, armed with battle-ax, portcullis and thundering

culverin, he rode through the greaves and bucklers of his donjon-keep

with as gallant a troop of Christian bandits as ever stepped in Italy.

He had his sword, Excalibur, with him.  His beautiful countess and her

young daughter waved him a tearful adieu from the battering-rams and

buttresses of the fortress, and he galloped away with a happy heart.



He made a raid on a neighboring baron and completed his outfit with the

booty secured.  He then razed the castle to the ground, massacred the

family and moved on.  They were hardy fellows in the grand old days of

chivalry.  Alas!  Those days will never come again.



Count Luigi grew high in fame in Holy Land.  He plunged into the carnage

of a hundred battles, but his good Excalibur always brought him out

alive, albeit often sorely wounded.  His face became browned by exposure

to the Syrian sun in long marches; he suffered hunger and thirst; he

pined in prisons, he languished in loathsome plague-hospitals.  And many

and many a time he thought of his loved ones at home, and wondered if all

was well with them.  But his heart said, Peace, is not thy brother

watching over thy household?



                              * * * * * * *



Forty-two years waxed and waned; the good fight was won; Godfrey reigned

in Jerusalem--the Christian hosts reared the banner of the cross above

the Holy Sepulchre!



Twilight was approaching.  Fifty harlequins, in flowing robes, approached

this castle wearily, for they were on foot, and the dust upon their

garments betokened that they had traveled far.  They overtook a peasant,

and asked him if it were likely they could get food and a hospitable bed

there, for love of Christian charity, and if perchance, a moral parlor

entertainment might meet with generous countenance--"for," said they,

"this exhibition hath no feature that could offend the most fastidious

taste."



"Marry," quoth the peasant, "an' it please your worships, ye had better

journey many a good rood hence with your juggling circus than trust your

bones in yonder castle."



"How now, sirrah!"  exclaimed the chief monk, "explain thy ribald speech,

or by'r Lady it shall go hard with thee."



"Peace, good mountebank, I did but utter the truth that was in my heart.

San Paolo be my witness that did ye but find the stout Count Leonardo in

his cups, sheer from the castle's topmost battlements would he hurl ye

all!  Alack-a-day, the good Lord Luigi reigns not here in these sad

times."



"The good Lord Luigi?"



"Aye, none other, please your worship.  In his day, the poor rejoiced in

plenty and the rich he did oppress; taxes were not known, the fathers of

the church waxed fat upon his bounty; travelers went and came, with none

to interfere; and whosoever would, might tarry in his halls in cordial

welcome, and eat his bread and drink his wine, withal.  But woe is me!

some two and forty years agone the good count rode hence to fight for

Holy Cross, and many a year hath flown since word or token have we had of

him.  Men say his bones lie bleaching in the fields of Palestine."



"And now?"



"Now!  God 'a mercy, the cruel Leonardo lords it in the castle.  He

wrings taxes from the poor; he robs all travelers that journey by his

gates; he spends his days in feuds and murders, and his nights in revel

and debauch; he roasts the fathers of the church upon his kitchen spits,

and enjoyeth the same, calling it pastime.  These thirty years Luigi's

countess hath not been seen by any [he] in all this land, and many

whisper that she pines in the dungeons of the castle for that she will

not wed with Leonardo, saying her dear lord still liveth and that she

will die ere she prove false to him.  They whisper likewise that her

daughter is a prisoner as well.  Nay, good jugglers, seek ye refreshment

other wheres.  'Twere better that ye perished in a Christian way than

that ye plunged from off yon dizzy tower.  Give ye good-day."



"God keep ye, gentle knave--farewell."



But heedless of the peasant's warning, the players moved straightway

toward the castle.



Word was brought to Count Leonardo that a company of mountebanks besought

his hospitality.



"'Tis well.  Dispose of them in the customary manner.  Yet stay!  I have

need of them.  Let them come hither.  Later, cast them from the

battlements--or--how many priests have ye on hand?"



"The day's results are meagre, good my lord.  An abbot and a dozen

beggarly friars is all we have."



"Hell and furies!  Is the estate going to seed?  Send hither the

mountebanks.  Afterward, broil them with the priests."



The robed and close-cowled harlequins entered.  The grim Leonardo sate in

state at the head of his council board.  Ranged up and down the hall on

either hand stood near a hundred men-at-arms.



"Ha, villains!"  quoth the count, "What can ye do to earn the hospitality

ye crave."



"Dread lord and mighty, crowded audiences have greeted our humble efforts

with rapturous applause.  Among our body count we the versatile and

talented Ugolino; the justly celebrated Rodolpho; the gifted and

accomplished Roderigo; the management have spared neither pains nor

expense--"



"S'death!  What can ye do?  Curb thy prating tongue."



"Good my lord, in acrobatic feats, in practice with the dumb-bells, in

balancing and ground and lofty tumbling are we versed--and sith your

highness asketh me, I venture here to publish that in the truly marvelous

and entertaining Zampillaerostation--"



"Gag him!  throttle him!  Body of Bacchus!  am I a dog that I am to be

assailed with polysyllabled blasphemy like to this?  But hold!  Lucretia,

Isabel, stand forth!  Sirrah, behold this dame, this weeping wench.  The

first I marry, within the hour; the other shall dry her tears or feed the

vultures.  Thou and thy vagabonds shall crown the wedding with thy merry-

makings.  Fetch hither the priest!"



The dame sprang toward the chief player.



"O, save me!"  she cried; "save me from a fate far worse than death!

Behold these sad eyes, these sunken cheeks, this withered frame!  See

thou the wreck this fiend hath made, and let thy heart be moved with

pity!  Look upon this damosel; note her wasted form, her halting step,

her bloomless cheeks where youth should blush and happiness exult in

smiles!  Hear us and have compassion.  This monster was my husband's

brother.  He who should have been our shield against all harm, hath kept

us shut within the noisome caverns of his donjon-keep for lo these thirty

years.  And for what crime?  None other than that I would not belie my

troth, root out my strong love for him who marches with the legions of

the cross in Holy Land, (for O, he is not dead!) and wed with him!  Save

us, O, save thy persecuted suppliants!"



She flung herself at his feet and clasped his knees.



"Ha!-ha!-ha!"  shouted the brutal Leonardo.  "Priest, to thy work!"  and

he dragged the weeping dame from her refuge.  "Say, once for all, will

you be mine?--for by my halidome, that breath that uttereth thy refusal

shall be thy last on earth!"



"NE-VER?"



"Then die!" and the sword leaped from its scabbard.



Quicker than thought, quicker than the lightning's flash, fifty monkish

habits disappeared, and fifty knights in splendid armor stood revealed!

fifty falchions gleamed in air above the men-at-arms, and brighter,

fiercer than them all, flamed Excalibur aloft, and cleaving downward

struck the brutal Leonardo's weapon from his grasp!



"A Luigi to the rescue!  Whoop!"



"A Leonardo!  'tare an ouns!'"



"Oh, God, Oh, God, my husband!"



"Oh, God, Oh, God, my wife!"



"My father!"



"My precious!"  [Tableau.]



Count Luigi bound his usurping brother hand and foot.  The practiced

knights from Palestine made holyday sport of carving the awkward men-at-

arms into chops and steaks.  The victory was complete.  Happiness

reigned.  The knights all married the daughter.  Joy!  wassail!  finis!



"But what did they do with the wicked brother?"



"Oh nothing--only hanged him on that iron hook I was speaking of.  By the

chin."



"As how?"



"Passed it up through his gills into his mouth."



"Leave him there?"



"Couple of years."



"Ah--is--is he dead?"



"Six hundred and fifty years ago, or such a matter."



"Splendid legend--splendid lie--drive on."



We reached the quaint old fortified city of Bergamo, the renowned in

history, some three-quarters of an hour before the train was ready to

start.  The place has thirty or forty thousand inhabitants and is

remarkable for being the birthplace of harlequin.  When we discovered

that, that legend of our driver took to itself a new interest in our

eyes.



Rested and refreshed, we took the rail happy and contented.  I shall not

tarry to speak of the handsome Lago di Gardi; its stately castle that

holds in its stony bosom the secrets of an age so remote that even

tradition goeth not back to it; the imposing mountain scenery that

ennobles the landscape thereabouts; nor yet of ancient Padua or haughty

Verona; nor of their Montagues and Capulets, their famous balconies and

tombs of Juliet and Romeo et al., but hurry straight to the ancient city

of the sea, the widowed bride of the Adriatic.  It was a long, long ride.

But toward evening, as we sat silent and hardly conscious of where we

were--subdued into that meditative calm that comes so surely after a

conversational storm--some one shouted--



"VENICE!"



And sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a great

city, with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist of

sunset.









CHAPTER XXII.



This Venice, which was a haughty, invincible, magnificent Republic for

nearly fourteen hundred years; whose armies compelled the world's

applause whenever and wherever they battled; whose navies well nigh held

dominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotest

oceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every

clime, is fallen a prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay.  Six

hundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat of Commerce; her mart was the

great commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the enormous

trade of the Orient was spread abroad over the Western world.  To-day her

piers are deserted, her warehouses are empty, her merchant fleets are

vanished, her armies and her navies are but memories.  Her glory is

departed, and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces about

her she sits among her stagnant lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgotten

of the world.  She that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of a

hemisphere and made the weal or woe of nations with a beck of her

puissant finger, is become the humblest among the peoples of the earth,--

a peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets for

school-girls and children.



The venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for

flippant speech or the idle gossipping of tourists.  It seems a sort of

sacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to us

softly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin and

her desolation from our view.  One ought, indeed, to turn away from her

rags, her poverty and her humiliation, and think of her only as she was

when she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled Frederick

Barbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements of

Constantinople.



We reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a hearse belonging

to the Grand Hotel d'Europe.  At any rate, it was more like a hearse than

any thing else, though to speak by the card, it was a gondola.  And this

was the storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which the princely

cavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave the waters of the moonlit

canals and look the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patrician

beauties, while the gay gondolier in silken doublet touched his guitar

and sang as only gondoliers can sing!  This the famed gondola and this

the gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old canoe with a sable

hearse-body clapped on to the middle of it, and the other a mangy,

barefooted guttersnipe with a portion of his raiment on exhibition which

should have been sacred from public scrutiny.  Presently, as he turned a

corner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows of

towering, untenanted buildings, the gay gondolier began to sing, true to

the traditions of his race.  I stood it a little while.  Then I said:



"Now, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a

stranger, but I am not going to have my feelings lacerated by any such

caterwauling as that.  If that goes on, one of us has got to take water.

It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blighted

forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; this

system of destruction shall go no farther; I will accept the hearse,

under protest, and you may fly your flag of truce in peace, but here I

register a dark and bloody oath that you shan't sing.  Another yelp, and

overboard you go."



I began to feel that the old Venice of song and story had departed

forever.  But I was too hasty.  In a few minutes we swept gracefully out

into the Grand Canal, and under the mellow moonlight the Venice of poetry

and romance stood revealed.  Right from the water's edge rose long lines

of stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and

thither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys;

ponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves.

There was life and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere there was a

hush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret

enterprises of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and half

in mysterious shadows, the grim old mansions of the Republic seemed to

have an expression about them of having an eye out for just such

enterprises as these at that same moment.  Music came floating over the

waters--Venice was complete.



It was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and beautiful.  But what

was this Venice to compare with the Venice of midnight?  Nothing.  There

was a fete--a grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrumental

in checking the cholera three hundred years ago, and all Venice was

abroad on the water.  It was no common affair, for the Venetians did not

know how soon they might need the saint's services again, now that the

cholera was spreading every where.  So in one vast space--say a third of

a mile wide and two miles long--were collected two thousand gondolas, and

every one of them had from two to ten, twenty and even thirty colored

lanterns suspended about it, and from four to a dozen occupants.  Just as

far as the eye could reach, these painted lights were massed together--

like a vast garden of many-colored flowers, except that these blossoms

were never still; they were ceaselessly gliding in and out, and mingling

together, and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy

evolutions.  Here and there a strong red, green, or blue glare from a

rocket that was struggling to get away, splendidly illuminated all the

boats around it.  Every gondola that swam by us, with its crescents and

pyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up the

faces of the young and the sweet-scented and lovely below, was a picture;

and the reflections of those lights, so long, so slender, so numberless,

so many-colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a picture

likewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful.  Many and many a party

of young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomely

decorated, and ate supper on board, bringing their swallow-tailed, white-

cravatted varlets to wait upon them, and having their tables tricked out

as if for a bridal supper.  They had brought along the costly globe lamps

from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and silken curtains from the same

places, I suppose.  And they had also brought pianos and guitars, and

they played and sang operas, while the plebeian paper-lanterned gondolas

from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded around to stare and listen.



There was music every where--choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes,

every thing.  I was so surrounded, walled in, with music, magnificence

and loveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, and

sang one tune myself.  However, when I observed that the other gondolas

had sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I

stopped.



The fete was magnificent.  They kept it up the whole night long, and I

never enjoyed myself better than I did while it lasted.



What a funny old city this Queen of the Adriatic is!  Narrow streets,

vast, gloomy marble palaces, black with the corroding damps of centuries,

and all partly submerged; no dry land visible any where, and no sidewalks

worth mentioning; if you want to go to church, to the theatre, or to the

restaurant, you must call a gondola.  It must be a paradise for cripples,

for verily a man has no use for legs here.



For a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed Arkansas town,

because of its currentless waters laving the very doorsteps of all the

houses, and the cluster of boats made fast under the windows, or skimming

in and out of the alleys and by-ways, that I could not get rid of the

impression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet,

and that the river would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty high-water

mark on the houses, and the streets full of mud and rubbish.



In the glare of day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under the

charitable moon her stained palaces are white again, their battered

sculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city seems crowned once

more with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago.  It is easy,

then, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and

fair ladies--with Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon

the rich argosies of Venetian commerce--with Othellos and Desdemonas,

with Iagos and Roderigos--with noble fleets and victorious legions

returning from the wars.  In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice

decayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken, and commerceless--forgotten and

utterly insignificant.  But in the moonlight, her fourteen centuries of

greatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the

princeliest among the nations of the earth.



          "There is a glorious city in the sea;

          The sea is in the broad, the narrow streets,

          Ebbing and flowing; and the salt-sea weed

          Clings to the marble of her palaces.

          No track of men, no footsteps to and fro,

          Lead to her gates!  The path lies o'er the sea,

          Invisible: and from the land we went,

          As to a floating city--steering in,

          And gliding up her streets, as in a dream,

          So smoothly, silently--by many a dome,

          Mosque-like, and many a stately portico,

          The statues ranged along an azure sky;

          By many a pile, in more than Eastern pride,

          Of old the residence of merchant kings;

          The fronts of some, tho' time had shatter'd them,

          Still glowing with the richest hues of art,

          As tho' the wealth within them had run o'er."



What would one naturally wish to see first in Venice?  The Bridge of

Sighs, of course--and next the Church and the Great Square of St. Mark,

the Bronze Horses, and the famous Lion of St. Mark.



We intended to go to the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the Ducal

Palace first--a building which necessarily figures largely in Venetian

poetry and tradition.  In the Senate Chamber of the ancient Republic we

wearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by

Tintoretto and Paul Veronese, but nothing struck us forcibly except the

one thing that strikes all strangers forcibly--a black square in the

midst of a gallery of portraits.  In one long row, around the great hall,

were painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows,

with flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible to

the office, the oldest was usually chosen Doge,) and each had its

complimentary inscription attached--till you came to the place that

should have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank and

black--blank, except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that the

conspirator had died for his crime.  It seemed cruel to keep that

pitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy

wretch had been in his grave five hundred years.



At the head of the Giant's Staircase, where Marino Faliero was beheaded,

and where the Doges were crowned in ancient times, two small slits in the

stone wall were pointed out--two harmless, insignificant orifices that

would never attract a stranger's attention--yet these were the terrible

Lions' Mouths!  The heads were gone (knocked off by the French during

their occupation of Venice,) but these were the throats, down which went

the anonymous accusation, thrust in secretly at dead of night by an

enemy, that doomed many an innocent man to walk the Bridge of Sighs and

descend into the dungeon which none entered and hoped to see the sun

again.  This was in the old days when the Patricians alone governed

Venice--the common herd had no vote and no voice.  There were one

thousand five hundred Patricians; from these, three hundred Senators were

chosen; from the Senators a Doge and a Council of Ten were selected, and

by secret ballot the Ten chose from their own number a Council of Three.

All these were Government spies, then, and every spy was under

surveillance himself--men spoke in whispers in Venice, and no man trusted

his neighbor--not always his own brother.  No man knew who the Council of

Three were--not even the Senate, not even the Doge; the members of that

dread tribunal met at night in a chamber to themselves, masked, and robed

from head to foot in scarlet cloaks, and did not even know each other,

unless by voice.  It was their duty to judge heinous political crimes,

and from their sentence there was no appeal.  A nod to the executioner

was sufficient.  The doomed man was marched down a hall and out at a

door-way into the covered Bridge of Sighs, through it and into the

dungeon and unto his death.  At no time in his transit was he visible to

any save his conductor.  If a man had an enemy in those old days, the

cleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the Council of Three

into the Lion's mouth, saying "This man is plotting against the

Government."  If the awful Three found no proof, ten to one they would

drown him anyhow, because he was a deep rascal, since his plots were

unsolvable.  Masked judges and masked executioners, with unlimited power,

and no appeal from their judgements, in that hard, cruel age, were not

likely to be lenient with men they suspected yet could not convict.



We walked through the hall of the Council of Ten, and presently entered

the infernal den of the Council of Three.



The table around which they had sat was there still, and likewise the

stations where the masked inquisitors and executioners formerly stood,

frozen, upright and silent, till they received a bloody order, and then,

without a word, moved off like the inexorable machines they were, to

carry it out.  The frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to the

place.  In all the other saloons, the halls, the great state chambers of

the palace, the walls and ceilings were bright with gilding, rich with

elaborate carving, and resplendent with gallant pictures of Venetian

victories in war, and Venetian display in foreign courts, and hallowed

with portraits of the Virgin, the Saviour of men, and the holy saints

that preached the Gospel of Peace upon earth--but here, in dismal

contrast, were none but pictures of death and dreadful suffering!--not a

living figure but was writhing in torture, not a dead one but was smeared

with blood, gashed with wounds, and distorted with the agonies that had

taken away its life!



From the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might almost jump

across the narrow canal that intervenes.  The ponderous stone Bridge of

Sighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel--

you can not be seen when you walk in it.  It is partitioned lengthwise,

and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in

ancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the

Three had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons,

or to sudden and mysterious death.  Down below the level of the water, by

the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells

where many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn

miseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked,

unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting

its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no

longer marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from

all cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his

helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing his

own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there;

devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into

the cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more with

hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratch

vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself,

could see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling

childishness, lunacy!  Many and many a sorrowful story like this these

stony walls could tell if they could but speak.



In a little narrow corridor, near by, they showed us where many a

prisoner, after lying in the dungeons until he was forgotten by all save

his persecutors, was brought by masked executioners and garroted, or

sewed up in a sack, passed through a little window to a boat, at dead of

night, and taken to some remote spot and drowned.



They used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith the

Three were wont to worm secrets out of the accused--villainous machines

for crushing thumbs; the stocks where a prisoner sat immovable while

water fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than

humanity could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which inclosed

a prisoner's head like a shell, and crushed it slowly by means of a

screw.  It bore the stains of blood that had trickled through its joints

long ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested

his elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the

sufferer perishing within.



Of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of

Venice, with its pavements worn and broken by the passing feet of a

thousand years of plebeians and patricians--The Cathedral of St. Mark.

It is built entirely of precious marbles, brought from the Orient--

nothing in its composition is domestic.  Its hoary traditions make it an

object of absorbing interest to even the most careless stranger, and thus

far it had interest for me; but no further.  I could not go into

ecstasies over its coarse mosaics, its unlovely Byzantine architecture,

or its five hundred curious interior columns from as many distant

quarries.  Every thing was worn out--every block of stone was smooth and

almost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders of loungers who

devoutly idled here in by-gone centuries and have died and gone to the

dev--no, simply died, I mean.



Under the altar repose the ashes of St. Mark--and Matthew, Luke and John,

too, for all I know.  Venice reveres those relics above all things

earthly.  For fourteen hundred years St. Mark has been her patron saint.

Every thing about the city seems to be named after him or so named as to

refer to him in some way--so named, or some purchase rigged in some way

to scrape a sort of hurrahing acquaintance with him.  That seems to be

the idea.  To be on good terms with St. Mark, seems to be the very summit

of Venetian ambition.  They say St. Mark had a tame lion, and used to

travel with him--and every where that St. Mark went, the lion was sure to

go.  It was his protector, his friend, his librarian.  And so the Winged

Lion of St. Mark, with the open Bible under his paw, is a favorite emblem

in the grand old city.  It casts its shadow from the most ancient pillar

in Venice, in the Grand Square of St. Mark, upon the throngs of free

citizens below, and has so done for many a long century.  The winged lion

is found every where--and doubtless here, where the winged lion is, no

harm can come.



St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt.  He was martyred, I think.

However, that has nothing to do with my legend.  About the founding of

the city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for

Venice is much younger than any other Italian city,) a priest dreamed

that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought to

Venice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the nations;

that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and a magnificent

church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians allowed the Saint to

be removed from his new resting-place, in that day Venice would perish

from off the face of the earth.  The priest proclaimed his dream, and

forthwith Venice set about procuring the corpse of St. Mark.  One

expedition after another tried and failed, but the project was never

abandoned during four hundred years.  At last it was secured by

stratagem, in the year eight hundred and something.  The commander of a

Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones, separated them,

and packed them in vessels filled with lard.  The religion of Mahomet

causes its devotees to abhor anything that is in the nature of pork, and

so when the Christian was stopped by the officers at the gates of the

city, they only glanced once into his precious baskets, then turned up

their noses at the unholy lard, and let him go.  The bones were buried in

the vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years to

receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were

secured.  And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if

those holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like a

dream, and its foundations be buried forever in the unremembering sea.









CHAPTER XXIII.



The Venetian gondola is as free and graceful, in its gliding movement, as

a serpent.  It is twenty or thirty feet long, and is narrow and deep,

like a canoe; its sharp bow and stern sweep upward from the water like

the horns of a crescent with the abruptness of the curve slightly

modified.



The bow is ornamented with a steel comb with a battle-ax attachment which

threatens to cut passing boats in two occasionally, but never does.  The

gondola is painted black because in the zenith of Venetian magnificence

the gondolas became too gorgeous altogether, and the Senate decreed that

all such display must cease, and a solemn, unembellished black be

substituted.  If the truth were known, it would doubtless appear that

rich plebeians grew too prominent in their affectation of patrician show

on the Grand Canal, and required a wholesome snubbing.  Reverence for the

hallowed Past and its traditions keeps the dismal fashion in force now

that the compulsion exists no longer.  So let it remain.  It is the color

of mourning.  Venice mourns.  The stern of the boat is decked over and

the gondolier stands there.  He uses a single oar--a long blade, of

course, for he stands nearly erect.  A wooden peg, a foot and a half

high, with two slight crooks or curves in one side of it and one in the

other, projects above the starboard gunwale.  Against that peg the

gondolier takes a purchase with his oar, changing it at intervals to the

other side of the peg or dropping it into another of the crooks, as the

steering of the craft may demand--and how in the world he can back and

fill, shoot straight ahead, or flirt suddenly around a corner, and make

the oar stay in those insignificant notches, is a problem to me and a

never diminishing matter of interest.  I am afraid I study the

gondolier's marvelous skill more than I do the sculptured palaces we

glide among.  He cuts a corner so closely, now and then, or misses

another gondola by such an imperceptible hair-breadth that I feel myself

"scrooching," as the children say, just as one does when a buggy wheel

grazes his elbow.  But he makes all his calculations with the nicest

precision, and goes darting in and out among a Broadway confusion of busy

craft with the easy confidence of the educated hackman.  He never makes a

mistake.



Sometimes we go flying down the great canals at such a gait that we can

get only the merest glimpses into front doors, and again, in obscure

alleys in the suburbs, we put on a solemnity suited to the silence, the

mildew, the stagnant waters, the clinging weeds, the deserted houses and

the general lifelessness of the place, and move to the spirit of grave

meditation.



The gondolier is a picturesque rascal for all he wears no satin harness,

no plumed bonnet, no silken tights.  His attitude is stately; he is lithe

and supple; all his movements are full of grace.  When his long canoe,

and his fine figure, towering from its high perch on the stern, are cut

against the evening sky, they make a picture that is very novel and

striking to a foreign eye.



We sit in the cushioned carriage-body of a cabin, with the curtains

drawn, and smoke, or read, or look out upon the passing boats, the

houses, the bridges, the people, and enjoy ourselves much more than we

could in a buggy jolting over our cobble-stone pavements at home.  This

is the gentlest, pleasantest locomotion we have ever known.



But it seems queer--ever so queer--to see a boat doing duty as a private

carriage.  We see business men come to the front door, step into a

gondola, instead of a street car, and go off down town to the counting-

room.



We see visiting young ladies stand on the stoop, and laugh, and kiss

good-bye, and flirt their fans and say "Come soon--now do--you've been

just as mean as ever you can be--mother's dying to see you--and we've

moved into the new house, O such a love of a place!--so convenient to the

post office and the church, and the Young Men's Christian Association;

and we do have such fishing, and such carrying on, and such swimming-

matches in the back yard--Oh, you must come--no distance at all, and if

you go down through by St. Mark's and the Bridge of Sighs, and cut

through the alley and come up by the church of Santa Maria dei Frari, and

into the Grand Canal, there isn't a bit of current--now do come, Sally

Maria--by-bye!" and then the little humbug trips down the steps, jumps

into the gondola, says, under her breath, "Disagreeable old thing, I hope

she won't!" goes skimming away, round the corner; and the other girl

slams the street door and says, "Well, that infliction's over, any way,--

but I suppose I've got to go and see her--tiresome stuck-up thing!"

Human nature appears to be just the same, all over the world.  We see the

diffident young man, mild of moustache, affluent of hair, indigent of

brain, elegant of costume, drive up to her father's mansion, tell his

hackman to bail out and wait, start fearfully up the steps and meet "the

old gentleman" right on the threshold!--hear him ask what street the new

British Bank is in--as if that were what he came for--and then bounce

into his boat and skurry away with his coward heart in his boots!--see

him come sneaking around the corner again, directly, with a crack of the

curtain open toward the old gentleman's disappearing gondola, and out

scampers his Susan with a flock of little Italian endearments fluttering

from her lips, and goes to drive with him in the watery avenues down

toward the Rialto.



We see the ladies go out shopping, in the most natural way, and flit from

street to street and from store to store, just in the good old fashion,

except that they leave the gondola, instead of a private carriage,

waiting at the curbstone a couple of hours for them,--waiting while they

make the nice young clerks pull down tons and tons of silks and velvets

and moire antiques and those things; and then they buy a paper of pins

and go paddling away to confer the rest of their disastrous patronage on

some other firm.  And they always have their purchases sent home just in

the good old way.  Human nature is very much the same all over the world;

and it is so like my dear native home to see a Venetian lady go into a

store and buy ten cents' worth of blue ribbon and have it sent home in a

scow.  Ah, it is these little touches of nature that move one to tears in

these far-off foreign lands.



We see little girls and boys go out in gondolas with their nurses, for an

airing.  We see staid families, with prayer-book and beads, enter the

gondola dressed in their Sunday best, and float away to church.  And at

midnight we see the theatre break up and discharge its swarm of hilarious

youth and beauty; we hear the cries of the hackman-gondoliers, and behold

the struggling crowd jump aboard, and the black multitude of boats go

skimming down the moonlit avenues; we see them separate here and there,

and disappear up divergent streets; we hear the faint sounds of laughter

and of shouted farewells floating up out of the distance; and then, the

strange pageant being gone, we have lonely stretches of glittering water

--of stately buildings--of blotting shadows--of weird stone faces

creeping into the moonlight--of deserted bridges--of motionless boats at

anchor.  And over all broods that mysterious stillness, that stealthy

quiet, that befits so well this old dreaming Venice.



We have been pretty much every where in our gondola.  We have bought

beads and photographs in the stores, and wax matches in the Great Square

of St. Mark.  The last remark suggests a digression.  Every body goes to

this vast square in the evening.  The military bands play in the centre

of it and countless couples of ladies and gentlemen promenade up and down

on either side, and platoons of them are constantly drifting away toward

the old Cathedral, and by the venerable column with the Winged Lion of

St. Mark on its top, and out to where the boats lie moored; and other

platoons are as constantly arriving from the gondolas and joining the

great throng.  Between the promenaders and the side-walks are seated

hundreds and hundreds of people at small tables, smoking and taking

granita, (a first cousin to ice-cream;) on the side-walks are more

employing themselves in the same way.  The shops in the first floor of

the tall rows of buildings that wall in three sides of the square are

brilliantly lighted, the air is filled with music and merry voices, and

altogether the scene is as bright and spirited and full of cheerfulness

as any man could desire.  We enjoy it thoroughly.  Very many of the young

women are exceedingly pretty and dress with rare good taste.  We are

gradually and laboriously learning the ill-manners of staring them

unflinchingly in the face--not because such conduct is agreeable to us,

but because it is the custom of the country and they say the girls like

it.  We wish to learn all the curious, outlandish ways of all the

different countries, so that we can "show off" and astonish people when

we get home.  We wish to excite the envy of our untraveled friends with

our strange foreign fashions which we can't shake off.  All our

passengers are paying strict attention to this thing, with the end in

view which I have mentioned.  The gentle reader will never, never know

what a consummate ass he can become, until he goes abroad.  I speak now,

of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad,

and therefore is not already a consummate ass.  If the case be otherwise,

I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and

call him brother.  I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own

heart when I shall have finished my travels.



On this subject let me remark that there are Americans abroad in Italy

who have actually forgotten their mother tongue in three months--forgot

it in France.  They can not even write their address in English in a

hotel register.  I append these evidences, which I copied verbatim from

the register of a hotel in a certain Italian city:



     "John P. Whitcomb, Etats Unis.  "Wm. L. Ainsworth, travailleur (he

     meant traveler, I suppose,) Etats Unis.  "George P. Morton et fils,

     d'Amerique.  "Lloyd B.  Williams, et trois amis, ville de Boston,

     Amerique.  "J. Ellsworth Baker, tout de suite de France, place de

     naissance Amerique, destination la Grand Bretagne."



I love this sort of people.  A lady passenger of ours tells of a fellow-

citizen of hers who spent eight weeks in Paris and then returned home and

addressed his dearest old bosom friend Herbert as Mr. "Er-bare!"  He

apologized, though, and said, "'Pon my soul it is aggravating, but I

cahn't help it--I have got so used to speaking nothing but French, my

dear Erbare--damme there it goes again!--got so used to French

pronunciation that I cahn't get rid of it--it is positively annoying, I

assure you."  This entertaining idiot, whose name was Gordon, allowed

himself to be hailed three times in the street before he paid any

attention, and then begged a thousand pardons and said he had grown so

accustomed to hearing himself addressed as "M'sieu Gor-r-dong," with a

roll to the r, that he had forgotten the legitimate sound of his name!

He wore a rose in his button-hole; he gave the French salutation--two

flips of the hand in front of the face; he called Paris Pairree in

ordinary English conversation; he carried envelopes bearing foreign

postmarks protruding from his breast-pocket; he cultivated a moustache

and imperial, and did what else he could to suggest to the beholder his

pet fancy that he resembled Louis Napoleon--and in a spirit of

thankfulness which is entirely unaccountable, considering the slim

foundation there was for it, he praised his Maker that he was as he was,

and went on enjoying his little life just the same as if he really had

been deliberately designed and erected by the great Architect of the

Universe.



Think of our Whitcombs, and our Ainsworths and our Williamses writing

themselves down in dilapidated French in foreign hotel registers!  We

laugh at Englishmen, when we are at home, for sticking so sturdily to

their national ways and customs, but we look back upon it from abroad

very forgivingly.  It is not pleasant to see an American thrusting his

nationality forward obtrusively in a foreign land, but Oh, it is pitiable

to see him making of himself a thing that is neither male nor female,

neither fish, flesh, nor fowl--a poor, miserable, hermaphrodite

Frenchman!



Among a long list of churches, art galleries, and such things, visited by

us in Venice, I shall mention only one--the church of Santa Maria dei

Frari.  It is about five hundred years old, I believe, and stands on

twelve hundred thousand piles.  In it lie the body of Canova and the

heart of Titian, under magnificent monuments.  Titian died at the age of

almost one hundred years.  A plague which swept away fifty thousand lives

was raging at the time, and there is notable evidence of the reverence in

which the great painter was held, in the fact that to him alone the state

permitted a public funeral in all that season of terror and death.



In this church, also, is a monument to the doge Foscari, whose name a

once resident of Venice, Lord Byron, has made permanently famous.



The monument to the doge Giovanni Pesaro, in this church, is a curiosity

in the way of mortuary adornment.  It is eighty feet high and is fronted

like some fantastic pagan temple.  Against it stand four colossal

Nubians, as black as night, dressed in white marble garments.  The black

legs are bare, and through rents in sleeves and breeches, the skin, of

shiny black marble, shows.  The artist was as ingenious as his funeral

designs were absurd.  There are two bronze skeletons bearing scrolls, and

two great dragons uphold the sarcophagus.  On high, amid all this

grotesqueness, sits the departed doge.



In the conventual buildings attached to this church are the state

archives of Venice.  We did not see them, but they are said to number

millions of documents.  "They are the records of centuries of the most

watchful, observant and suspicious government that ever existed--in which

every thing was written down and nothing spoken out."  They fill nearly

three hundred rooms.  Among them are manuscripts from the archives of

nearly two thousand families, monasteries and convents.  The secret

history of Venice for a thousand years is here--its plots, its hidden

trials, its assassinations, its commissions of hireling spies and masked

bravoes--food, ready to hand, for a world of dark and mysterious

romances.



Yes, I think we have seen all of Venice.  We have seen, in these old

churches, a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation

such as we never dreampt of before.  We have stood in the dim religious

light of these hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dusty

monuments and effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemed

drifting back, back, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon the

scenes and mingling with the peoples of a remote antiquity.  We have been

in a half-waking sort of dream all the time.  I do not know how else to

describe the feeling.  A part of our being has remained still in the

nineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in some

unaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth.



We have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at

them and refuse to find interest in them any longer.  And what wonder,

when there are twelve hundred pictures by Palma the Younger in Venice and

fifteen hundred by Tintoretto?  And behold there are Titians and the

works of other artists in proportion.  We have seen Titian's celebrated

Cain and Abel, his David and Goliah, his Abraham's Sacrifice.  We have

seen Tintoretto's monster picture, which is seventy-four feet long and I

do not know how many feet high, and thought it a very commodious picture.

We have seen pictures of martyrs enough, and saints enough, to regenerate

the world.  I ought not to confess it, but still, since one has no

opportunity in America to acquire a critical judgment in art, and since I

could not hope to become educated in it in Europe in a few short weeks, I

may therefore as well acknowledge with such apologies as may be due, that

to me it seemed that when I had seen one of these martyrs I had seen them

all.  They all have a marked family resemblance to each other, they dress

alike, in coarse monkish robes and sandals, they are all bald headed,

they all stand in about the same attitude, and without exception they are

gazing heavenward with countenances which the Ainsworths, the Mortons and

the Williamses, et fils, inform me are full of "expression."  To me there

is nothing tangible about these imaginary portraits, nothing that I can

grasp and take a living interest in.  If great Titian had only been

gifted with prophecy, and had skipped a martyr, and gone over to England

and painted a portrait of Shakspeare, even as a youth, which we could all

have confidence in now, the world down to the latest generations would

have forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescued seer.  I think posterity

could have spared one more martyr for the sake of a great historical

picture of Titian's time and painted by his brush--such as Columbus

returning in chains from the discovery of a world, for instance.  The old

masters did paint some Venetian historical pictures, and these we did not

tire of looking at, notwithstanding representations of the formal

introduction of defunct doges to the Virgin Mary in regions beyond the

clouds clashed rather harshly with the proprieties, it seemed to us.



But humble as we are, and unpretending, in the matter of art, our

researches among the painted monks and martyrs have not been wholly in

vain.  We have striven hard to learn.  We have had some success.  We have

mastered some things, possibly of trifling import in the eyes of the

learned, but to us they give pleasure, and we take as much pride in our

little acquirements as do others who have learned far more, and we love

to display them full as well.  When we see a monk going about with a lion

and looking tranquilly up to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark.  When

we see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven,

trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew.  When we see

a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human

skull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St.

Jerome.  Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter

of baggage.  When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven,

unconscious that his body is shot through and through with arrows, we

know that that is St. Sebastian.  When we see other monks looking

tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who

those parties are.  We do this because we humbly wish to learn.  We have

seen thirteen thousand St. Jeromes, and twenty-two thousand St. Marks,

and sixteen thousand St. Matthews, and sixty thousand St. Sebastians, and

four millions of assorted monks, undesignated, and we feel encouraged to

believe that when we have seen some more of these various pictures, and

had a larger experience, we shall begin to take an absorbing interest in

them like our cultivated countrymen from Amerique.



Now it does give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way

of the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the

ship--friends who do thoroughly and conscientiously appreciate them and

are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and

inferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact

that I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself.  I

believe that what I have written and may still write about pictures will

give them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it.  I even promised that I

would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast.  But alas!  I never

could keep a promise.  I do not blame myself for this weakness, because

the fault must lie in my physical organization.  It is likely that such a

very liberal amount of space was given to the organ which enables me to

make promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was

crowded out.  But I grieve not.  I like no half-way things.  I had rather

have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary

capacity.  I certainly meant to keep that promise, but I find I can not

do it.  It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking of

pictures, and can I see them through others' eyes?



If I did not so delight in the grand pictures that are spread before me

every day of my life by that monarch of all the old masters, Nature, I

should come to believe, sometimes, that I had in me no appreciation of

the beautiful, whatsoever.



It seems to me that whenever I glory to think that for once I have

discovered an ancient painting that is beautiful and worthy of all

praise, the pleasure it gives me is an infallible proof that it is not a

beautiful picture and not in any wise worthy of commendation.  This very

thing has occurred more times than I can mention, in Venice.  In every

single instance the guide has crushed out my swelling enthusiasm with the

remark:



"It is nothing--it is of the Renaissance."



I did not know what in the mischief the Renaissance was, and so always I

had to simply say,



"Ah!  so it is--I had not observed it before."



I could not bear to be ignorant before a cultivated negro, the offspring

of a South Carolina slave.  But it occurred too often for even my self-

complacency, did that exasperating "It is nothing--it is of the

Renaissance."  I said at last:



"Who is this Renaissance?  Where did he come from?  Who gave him

permission to cram the Republic with his execrable daubs?"



We learned, then, that Renaissance was not a man; that renaissance was a

term used to signify what was at best but an imperfect rejuvenation of

art.  The guide said that after Titian's time and the time of the other

great names we had grown so familiar with, high art declined; then it

partially rose again--an inferior sort of painters sprang up, and these

shabby pictures were the work of their hands.  Then I said, in my heat,

that I "wished to goodness high art had declined five hundred years

sooner."  The Renaissance pictures suit me very well, though sooth to say

its school were too much given to painting real men and did not indulge

enough in martyrs.



The guide I have spoken of is the only one we have had yet who knew any

thing.  He was born in South Carolina, of slave parents.  They came to

Venice while he was an infant.  He has grown up here.  He is well

educated.  He reads, writes, and speaks English, Italian, Spanish, and

French, with perfect facility; is a worshipper of art and thoroughly

conversant with it; knows the history of Venice by heart and never tires

of talking of her illustrious career.  He dresses better than any of us,

I think, and is daintily polite.  Negroes are deemed as good as white

people, in Venice, and so this man feels no desire to go back to his

native land.  His judgment is correct.



I have had another shave.  I was writing in our front room this afternoon

and trying hard to keep my attention on my work and refrain from looking

out upon the canal.  I was resisting the soft influences of the climate

as well as I could, and endeavoring to overcome the desire to be indolent

and happy.  The boys sent for a barber.  They asked me if I would be

shaved.  I reminded them of my tortures in Genoa, Milan, Como; of my

declaration that I would suffer no more on Italian soil.  I said "Not any

for me, if you please."



I wrote on.  The barber began on the doctor.  I heard him say:



"Dan, this is the easiest shave I have had since we left the ship."



He said again, presently:



"Why Dan, a man could go to sleep with this man shaving him."



Dan took the chair.  Then he said:



"Why this is Titian.  This is one of the old masters."



I wrote on.  Directly Dan said:



"Doctor, it is perfect luxury.  The ship's barber isn't any thing to

him."



My rough beard wee distressing me beyond measure.  The barber was rolling

up his apparatus.  The temptation was too strong.  I said:



"Hold on, please.  Shave me also."



I sat down in the chair and closed my eyes.  The barber soaped my face,

and then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me into

convulsions.  I jumped out of the chair: Dan and the doctor were both

wiping blood off their faces and laughing.



I said it was a mean, disgraceful fraud.



They said that the misery of this shave had gone so far beyond any thing

they had ever experienced before, that they could not bear the idea of

losing such a chance of hearing a cordial opinion from me on the subject.



It was shameful.  But there was no help for it.  The skinning was begun

and had to be finished.  The tears flowed with every rake, and so did the

fervent execrations.  The barber grew confused, and brought blood every

time.  I think the boys enjoyed it better than any thing they have seen

or heard since they left home.



We have seen the Campanile, and Byron's house and Balbi's the geographer,

and the palaces of all the ancient dukes and doges of Venice, and we have

seen their effeminate descendants airing their nobility in fashionable

French attire in the Grand Square of St. Mark, and eating ices and

drinking cheap wines, instead of wearing gallant coats of mail and

destroying fleets and armies as their great ancestors did in the days of

Venetian glory.  We have seen no bravoes with poisoned stilettos, no

masks, no wild carnival; but we have seen the ancient pride of Venice,

the grim Bronze Horses that figure in a thousand legends.  Venice may

well cherish them, for they are the only horses she ever had.  It is said

there are hundreds of people in this curious city who never have seen a

living horse in their lives.  It is entirely true, no doubt.



And so, having satisfied ourselves, we depart to-morrow, and leave the

venerable Queen of the Republics to summon her vanished ships, and

marshal her shadowy armies, and know again in dreams the pride of her old

renown.









CHAPTER XXIV.



Some of the Quaker City's passengers had arrived in Venice from

Switzerland and other lands before we left there, and others were

expected every day.  We heard of no casualties among them, and no

sickness.



We were a little fatigued with sight seeing, and so we rattled through a

good deal of country by rail without caring to stop.  I took few notes.

I find no mention of Bologna in my memorandum book, except that we

arrived there in good season, but saw none of the sausages for which the

place is so justly celebrated.



Pistoia awoke but a passing interest.



Florence pleased us for a while.  I think we appreciated the great figure

of David in the grand square, and the sculptured group they call the Rape

of the Sabines.  We wandered through the endless collections of paintings

and statues of the Pitti and Ufizzi galleries, of course.  I make that

statement in self-defense; there let it stop.  I could not rest under the

imputation that I visited Florence and did not traverse its weary miles

of picture galleries.  We tried indolently to recollect something about

the Guelphs and Ghibelines and the other historical cut-throats whose

quarrels and assassinations make up so large a share of Florentine

history, but the subject was not attractive.  We had been robbed of all

the fine mountain scenery on our little journey by a system of

railroading that had three miles of tunnel to a hundred yards of

daylight, and we were not inclined to be sociable with Florence.  We had

seen the spot, outside the city somewhere, where these people had allowed

the bones of Galileo to rest in unconsecrated ground for an age because

his great discovery that the world turned around was regarded as a

damning heresy by the church; and we know that long after the world had

accepted his theory and raised his name high in the list of its great

men, they had still let him rot there.  That we had lived to see his dust

in honored sepulture in the church of Santa Croce we owed to a society of

literati, and not to Florence or her rulers.  We saw Dante's tomb in that

church, also, but we were glad to know that his body was not in it; that

the ungrateful city that had exiled him and persecuted him would give

much to have it there, but need not hope to ever secure that high honor

to herself.  Medicis are good enough for Florence.  Let her plant Medicis

and build grand monuments over them to testify how gratefully she was

wont to lick the hand that scourged her.



Magnanimous Florence!  Her jewelry marts are filled with artists in

mosaic.  Florentine mosaics are the choicest in all the world.  Florence

loves to have that said.  Florence is proud of it.  Florence would foster

this specialty of hers.  She is grateful to the artists that bring to her

this high credit and fill her coffers with foreign money, and so she

encourages them with pensions.  With pensions!  Think of the lavishness

of it.  She knows that people who piece together the beautiful trifles

die early, because the labor is so confining, and so exhausting to hand

and brain, and so she has decreed that all these people who reach the age

of sixty shall have a pension after that!  I have not heard that any of

them have called for their dividends yet.  One man did fight along till

he was sixty, and started after his pension, but it appeared that there

had been a mistake of a year in his family record, and so he gave it up

and died.



These artists will take particles of stone or glass no larger than a

mustard seed, and piece them together on a sleeve button or a shirt stud,

so smoothly and with such nice adjustment of the delicate shades of color

the pieces bear, as to form a pigmy rose with stem, thorn, leaves, petals

complete, and all as softly and as truthfully tinted as though Nature had

builded it herself.  They will counterfeit a fly, or a high-toned bug, or

the ruined Coliseum, within the cramped circle of a breastpin, and do it

so deftly and so neatly that any man might think a master painted it.



I saw a little table in the great mosaic school in Florence--a little

trifle of a centre table--whose top was made of some sort of precious

polished stone, and in the stone was inlaid the figure of a flute, with

bell-mouth and a mazy complication of keys.  No painting in the world

could have been softer or richer; no shading out of one tint into another

could have been more perfect; no work of art of any kind could have been

more faultless than this flute, and yet to count the multitude of little

fragments of stone of which they swore it was formed would bankrupt any

man's arithmetic!  I do not think one could have seen where two particles

joined each other with eyes of ordinary shrewdness.  Certainly we could

detect no such blemish.  This table-top cost the labor of one man for ten

long years, so they said, and it was for sale for thirty-five thousand

dollars.



We went to the Church of Santa Croce, from time to time, in Florence, to

weep over the tombs of Michael Angelo, Raphael and Machiavelli,

(I suppose they are buried there, but it may be that they reside

elsewhere and rent their tombs to other parties--such being the fashion

in Italy,) and between times we used to go and stand on the bridges and

admire the Arno.  It is popular to admire the Arno.  It is a great

historical creek with four feet in the channel and some scows floating

around.  It would be a very plausible river if they would pump some water

into it.  They all call it a river, and they honestly think it is a

river, do these dark and bloody Florentines.  They even help out the

delusion by building bridges over it.  I do not see why they are too good

to wade.



How the fatigues and annoyances of travel fill one with bitter prejudices

sometimes!  I might enter Florence under happier auspices a month hence

and find it all beautiful, all attractive.  But I do not care to think of

it now, at all, nor of its roomy shops filled to the ceiling with snowy

marble and alabaster copies of all the celebrated sculptures in Europe--

copies so enchanting to the eye that I wonder how they can really be

shaped like the dingy petrified nightmares they are the portraits of.  I

got lost in Florence at nine o'clock, one night, and staid lost in that

labyrinth of narrow streets and long rows of vast buildings that look all

alike, until toward three o'clock in the morning.  It was a pleasant

night and at first there were a good many people abroad, and there were

cheerful lights about.  Later, I grew accustomed to prowling about

mysterious drifts and tunnels and astonishing and interesting myself with

coming around corners expecting to find the hotel staring me in the face,

and not finding it doing any thing of the kind.  Later still, I felt

tired.  I soon felt remarkably tired.  But there was no one abroad, now--

not even a policeman.  I walked till I was out of all patience, and very

hot and thirsty.  At last, somewhere after one o'clock, I came

unexpectedly to one of the city gates.  I knew then that I was very far

from the hotel.  The soldiers thought I wanted to leave the city, and

they sprang up and barred the way with their muskets.  I said:



"Hotel d'Europe!"



It was all the Italian I knew, and I was not certain whether that was

Italian or French.  The soldiers looked stupidly at each other and at me,

and shook their heads and took me into custody.  I said I wanted to go

home.  They did not understand me.  They took me into the guard-house and

searched me, but they found no sedition on me.  They found a small piece

of soap (we carry soap with us, now,) and I made them a present of it,

seeing that they regarded it as a curiosity.  I continued to say Hotel

d'Europe, and they continued to shake their heads, until at last a young

soldier nodding in the corner roused up and said something.  He said he

knew where the hotel was, I suppose, for the officer of the guard sent

him away with me.  We walked a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles, it

appeared to me, and then he got lost.  He turned this way and that, and

finally gave it up and signified that he was going to spend the remainder

of the morning trying to find the city gate again.  At that moment it

struck me that there was something familiar about the house over the way.

It was the hotel!



It was a happy thing for me that there happened to be a soldier there

that knew even as much as he did; for they say that the policy of the

government is to change the soldiery from one place to another constantly

and from country to city, so that they can not become acquainted with the

people and grow lax in their duties and enter into plots and conspiracies

with friends.  My experiences of Florence were chiefly unpleasant.  I

will change the subject.



At Pisa we climbed up to the top of the strangest structure the world has

any knowledge of--the Leaning Tower.  As every one knows, it is in the

neighborhood of one hundred and eighty feet high--and I beg to observe

that one hundred and eighty feet reach to about the hight of four

ordinary three-story buildings piled one on top of the other, and is a

very considerable altitude for a tower of uniform thickness to aspire to,

even when it stands upright--yet this one leans more than thirteen feet

out of the perpendicular.  It is seven hundred years old, but neither

history or tradition say whether it was built as it is, purposely, or

whether one of its sides has settled.  There is no record that it ever

stood straight up.  It is built of marble.  It is an airy and a beautiful

structure, and each of its eight stories is encircled by fluted columns,

some of marble and some of granite, with Corinthian capitals that were

handsome when they were new.  It is a bell tower, and in its top hangs a

chime of ancient bells.  The winding staircase within is dark, but one

always knows which side of the tower he is on because of his naturally

gravitating from one side to the other of the staircase with the rise or

dip of the tower.  Some of the stone steps are foot-worn only on one end;

others only on the other end; others only in the middle.  To look down

into the tower from the top is like looking down into a tilted well.  A

rope that hangs from the centre of the top touches the wall before it

reaches the bottom.  Standing on the summit, one does not feel altogether

comfortable when he looks down from the high side; but to crawl on your

breast to the verge on the lower side and try to stretch your neck out

far enough to see the base of the tower, makes your flesh creep, and

convinces you for a single moment in spite of all your philosophy, that

the building is falling.  You handle yourself very carefully, all the

time, under the silly impression that if it is not falling, your trifling

weight will start it unless you are particular not to "bear down" on it.



The Duomo, close at hand, is one of the finest cathedrals in Europe.  It

is eight hundred years old.  Its grandeur has outlived the high

commercial prosperity and the political importance that made it a

necessity, or rather a possibility.  Surrounded by poverty, decay and

ruin, it conveys to us a more tangible impression of the former greatness

of Pisa than books could give us.



The Baptistery, which is a few years older than the Leaning Tower, is a

stately rotunda, of huge dimensions, and was a costly structure.  In it

hangs the lamp whose measured swing suggested to Galileo the pendulum.

It looked an insignificant thing to have conferred upon the world of

science and mechanics such a mighty extension of their dominions as it

has.  Pondering, in its suggestive presence, I seemed to see a crazy

universe of swinging disks, the toiling children of this sedate parent.

He appeared to have an intelligent expression about him of knowing that

he was not a lamp at all; that he was a Pendulum; a pendulum disguised,

for prodigious and inscrutable purposes of his own deep devising, and not

a common pendulum either, but the old original patriarchal Pendulum--the

Abraham Pendulum of the world.



This Baptistery is endowed with the most pleasing echo of all the echoes

we have read of.  The guide sounded two sonorous notes, about half an

octave apart; the echo answered with the most enchanting, the most

melodious, the richest blending of sweet sounds that one can imagine.  It

was like a long-drawn chord of a church organ, infinitely softened by

distance.  I may be extravagant in this matter, but if this be the case

my ear is to blame--not my pen.  I am describing a memory--and one that

will remain long with me.



The peculiar devotional spirit of the olden time, which placed a higher

confidence in outward forms of worship than in the watchful guarding of

the heart against sinful thoughts and the hands against sinful deeds, and

which believed in the protecting virtues of inanimate objects made holy

by contact with holy things, is illustrated in a striking manner in one

of the cemeteries of Pisa.  The tombs are set in soil brought in ships

from the Holy Land ages ago.  To be buried in such ground was regarded by

the ancient Pisans as being more potent for salvation than many masses

purchased of the church and the vowing of many candles to the Virgin.



Pisa is believed to be about three thousand years old.  It was one of the

twelve great cities of ancient Etruria, that commonwealth which has left

so many monuments in testimony of its extraordinary advancement, and so

little history of itself that is tangible and comprehensible.  A Pisan

antiquarian gave me an ancient tear-jug which he averred was full four

thousand years old.  It was found among the ruins of one of the oldest of

the Etruscan cities.  He said it came from a tomb, and was used by some

bereaved family in that remote age when even the Pyramids of Egypt were

young, Damascus a village, Abraham a prattling infant and ancient Troy

not yet [dreampt] of, to receive the tears wept for some lost idol of a

household.  It spoke to us in a language of its own; and with a pathos

more tender than any words might bring, its mute eloquence swept down the

long roll of the centuries with its tale of a vacant chair, a familiar

footstep missed from the threshold, a pleasant voice gone from the

chorus, a vanished form!--a tale which is always so new to us, so

startling, so terrible, so benumbing to the senses, and behold how

threadbare and old it is!  No shrewdly-worded history could have brought

the myths and shadows of that old dreamy age before us clothed with human

flesh and warmed with human sympathies so vividly as did this poor little

unsentient vessel of pottery.



Pisa was a republic in the middle ages, with a government of her own,

armies and navies of her own and a great commerce.  She was a warlike

power, and inscribed upon her banners many a brilliant fight with Genoese

and Turks.  It is said that the city once numbered a population of four

hundred thousand; but her sceptre has passed from her grasp, now, her

ships and her armies are gone, her commerce is dead.  Her battle-flags

bear the mold and the dust of centuries, her marts are deserted, she has

shrunken far within her crumbling walls, and her great population has

diminished to twenty thousand souls.  She has but one thing left to boast

of, and that is not much, viz: she is the second city of Tuscany.



We reached Leghorn in time to see all we wished to see of it long before

the city gates were closed for the evening, and then came on board the

ship.



We felt as though we had been away from home an age.  We never entirely

appreciated, before, what a very pleasant den our state-room is; nor how

jolly it is to sit at dinner in one's own seat in one's own cabin, and

hold familiar conversation with friends in one's own language.  Oh, the

rare happiness of comprehending every single word that is said, and

knowing that every word one says in return will be understood as well!

We would talk ourselves to death, now, only there are only about ten

passengers out of the sixty-five to talk to.  The others are wandering,

we hardly know where.  We shall not go ashore in Leghorn.  We are

surfeited with Italian cities for the present, and much prefer to walk

the familiar quarterdeck and view this one from a distance.



The stupid magnates of this Leghorn government can not understand that so

large a steamer as ours could cross the broad Atlantic with no other

purpose than to indulge a party of ladies and gentlemen in a pleasure

excursion.  It looks too improbable.  It is suspicious, they think.

Something more important must be hidden behind it all.  They can not

understand it, and they scorn the evidence of the ship's papers.  They

have decided at last that we are a battalion of incendiary, blood-thirsty

Garibaldians in disguise!  And in all seriousness they have set a gun-

boat to watch the vessel night and day, with orders to close down on any

revolutionary movement in a twinkling!  Police boats are on patrol duty

about us all the time, and it is as much as a sailor's liberty is worth

to show himself in a red shirt.  These policemen follow the executive

officer's boat from shore to ship and from ship to shore and watch his

dark maneuvres with a vigilant eye.  They will arrest him yet unless he

assumes an expression of countenance that shall have less of carnage,

insurrection and sedition in it.  A visit paid in a friendly way to

General Garibaldi yesterday (by cordial invitation,) by some of our

passengers, has gone far to confirm the dread suspicions the government

harbors toward us.  It is thought the friendly visit was only the cloak

of a bloody conspiracy.  These people draw near and watch us when we

bathe in the sea from the ship's side.  Do they think we are communing

with a reserve force of rascals at the bottom?



It is said that we shall probably be quarantined at Naples.  Two or three

of us prefer not to run this risk.  Therefore, when we are rested, we

propose to go in a French steamer to Civita and from thence to Rome, and

by rail to Naples.  They do not quarantine the cars, no matter where they

got their passengers from.









CHAPTER XXV.



There are a good many things about this Italy which I do not understand--

and more especially I can not understand how a bankrupt Government can

have such palatial railroad depots and such marvels of turnpikes.  Why,

these latter are as hard as adamant, as straight as a line, as smooth as

a floor, and as white as snow.  When it is too dark to see any other

object, one can still see the white turnpikes of France and Italy; and

they are clean enough to eat from, without a table-cloth.  And yet no

tolls are charged.



As for the railways--we have none like them.  The cars slide as smoothly

along as if they were on runners.  The depots are vast palaces of cut

marble, with stately colonnades of the same royal stone traversing them

from end to end, and with ample walls and ceilings richly decorated with

frescoes.  The lofty gateways are graced with statues, and the broad

floors are all laid in polished flags of marble.



These things win me more than Italy's hundred galleries of priceless art

treasures, because I can understand the one and am not competent to

appreciate the other.  In the turnpikes, the railways, the depots, and

the new boulevards of uniform houses in Florence and other cities here, I

see the genius of Louis Napoleon, or rather, I see the works of that

statesman imitated.  But Louis has taken care that in France there shall

be a foundation for these improvements--money.  He has always the

wherewithal to back up his projects; they strengthen France and never

weaken her.  Her material prosperity is genuine.  But here the case is

different.  This country is bankrupt.  There is no real foundation for

these great works.  The prosperity they would seem to indicate is a

pretence.  There is no money in the treasury, and so they enfeeble her

instead of strengthening.  Italy has achieved the dearest wish of her

heart and become an independent State--and in so doing she has drawn an

elephant in the political lottery.  She has nothing to feed it on.

Inexperienced in government, she plunged into all manner of useless

expenditure, and swamped her treasury almost in a day.  She squandered

millions of francs on a navy which she did not need, and the first time

she took her new toy into action she got it knocked higher than

Gilderoy's kite--to use the language of the Pilgrims.



But it is an ill-wind that blows nobody good.  A year ago, when Italy saw

utter ruin staring her in the face and her greenbacks hardly worth the

paper they were printed on, her Parliament ventured upon a 'coup de main'

that would have appalled the stoutest of her statesmen under less

desperate circumstances.  They, in a manner, confiscated the domains of

the Church!  This in priest-ridden Italy!  This in a land which has

groped in the midnight of priestly superstition for sixteen hundred

years!  It was a rare good fortune for Italy, the stress of weather that

drove her to break from this prison-house.



They do not call it confiscating the church property.  That would sound

too harshly yet.  But it amounts to that.  There are thousands of

churches in Italy, each with untold millions of treasures stored away in

its closets, and each with its battalion of priests to be supported.

And then there are the estates of the Church--league on league of the

richest lands and the noblest forests in all Italy--all yielding immense

revenues to the Church, and none paying a cent in taxes to the State.

In some great districts the Church owns all the property--lands,

watercourses, woods, mills and factories.  They buy, they sell, they

manufacture, and since they pay no taxes, who can hope to compete with

them?



Well, the Government has seized all this in effect, and will yet seize it

in rigid and unpoetical reality, no doubt.  Something must be done to

feed a starving treasury, and there is no other resource in all Italy--

none but the riches of the Church.  So the Government intends to take to

itself a great portion of the revenues arising from priestly farms,

factories, etc., and also intends to take possession of the churches and

carry them on, after its own fashion and upon its own responsibility.

In a few instances it will leave the establishments of great pet churches

undisturbed, but in all others only a handful of priests will be retained

to preach and pray, a few will be pensioned, and the balance turned

adrift.



Pray glance at some of these churches and their embellishments, and see

whether the Government is doing a righteous thing or not.  In Venice,

today, a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants, there are twelve hundred

priests.  Heaven only knows how many there were before the Parliament

reduced their numbers.  There was the great Jesuit Church.  Under the old

regime it required sixty priests to engineer it--the Government does it

with five, now, and the others are discharged from service.  All about

that church wretchedness and poverty abound.  At its door a dozen hats

and bonnets were doffed to us, as many heads were humbly bowed, and as

many hands extended, appealing for pennies--appealing with foreign words

we could not understand, but appealing mutely, with sad eyes, and sunken

cheeks, and ragged raiment, that no words were needed to translate.  Then

we passed within the great doors, and it seemed that the riches of the

world were before us!  Huge columns carved out of single masses of

marble, and inlaid from top to bottom with a hundred intricate figures

wrought in costly verde antique; pulpits of the same rich materials,

whose draperies hung down in many a pictured fold, the stony fabric

counterfeiting the delicate work of the loom; the grand altar brilliant

with polished facings and balustrades of oriental agate, jasper, verde

antique, and other precious stones, whose names, even, we seldom hear--

and slabs of priceless lapis lazuli lavished every where as recklessly as

if the church had owned a quarry of it.  In the midst of all this

magnificence, the solid gold and silver furniture of the altar seemed

cheap and trivial.  Even the floors and ceilings cost a princely fortune.



Now, where is the use of allowing all those riches to lie idle, while

half of that community hardly know, from day to day, how they are going

to keep body and soul together?  And, where is the wisdom in permitting

hundreds upon hundreds of millions of francs to be locked up in the

useless trumpery of churches all over Italy, and the people ground to

death with taxation to uphold a perishing Government?



As far as I can see, Italy, for fifteen hundred years, has turned all her

energies, all her finances, and all her industry to the building up of a

vast array of wonderful church edifices, and starving half her citizens

to accomplish it.  She is to-day one vast museum of magnificence and

misery.  All the churches in an ordinary American city put together could

hardly buy the jeweled frippery in one of her hundred cathedrals.  And

for every beggar in America, Italy can show a hundred--and rags and

vermin to match.  It is the wretchedest, princeliest land on earth.



Look at the grand Duomo of Florence--a vast pile that has been sapping

the purses of her citizens for five hundred years, and is not nearly

finished yet.  Like all other men, I fell down and worshipped it, but

when the filthy beggars swarmed around me the contrast was too striking,

too suggestive, and I said, "O, sons of classic Italy, is the spirit of

enterprise, of self-reliance, of noble endeavor, utterly dead within ye?

Curse your indolent worthlessness, why don't you rob your church?"



Three hundred happy, comfortable priests are employed in that Cathedral.



And now that my temper is up, I may as well go on and abuse every body I

can think of.  They have a grand mausoleum in Florence, which they built

to bury our Lord and Saviour and the Medici family in.  It sounds

blasphemous, but it is true, and here they act blasphemy.  The dead and

damned Medicis who cruelly tyrannized over Florence and were her curse

for over two hundred years, are salted away in a circle of costly vaults,

and in their midst the Holy Sepulchre was to have been set up.  The

expedition sent to Jerusalem to seize it got into trouble and could not

accomplish the burglary, and so the centre of the mausoleum is vacant

now.  They say the entire mausoleum was intended for the Holy Sepulchre,

and was only turned into a family burying place after the Jerusalem

expedition failed--but you will excuse me.  Some of those Medicis would

have smuggled themselves in sure.--What they had not the effrontery to

do, was not worth doing.  Why, they had their trivial, forgotten exploits

on land and sea pictured out in grand frescoes (as did also the ancient

Doges of Venice) with the Saviour and the Virgin throwing bouquets to

them out of the clouds, and the Deity himself applauding from his throne

in Heaven!  And who painted these things?  Why, Titian, Tintoretto, Paul

Veronese, Raphael--none other than the world's idols, the "old masters."



Andrea del Sarto glorified his princes in pictures that must save them

for ever from the oblivion they merited, and they let him starve.  Served

him right.  Raphael pictured such infernal villains as Catherine and

Marie de Medicis seated in heaven and conversing familiarly with the

Virgin Mary and the angels, (to say nothing of higher personages,) and

yet my friends abuse me because I am a little prejudiced against the old

masters--because I fail sometimes to see the beauty that is in their

productions.  I can not help but see it, now and then, but I keep on

protesting against the groveling spirit that could persuade those masters

to prostitute their noble talents to the adulation of such monsters as

the French, Venetian and Florentine Princes of two and three hundred

years ago, all the same.



I am told that the old masters had to do these shameful things for bread,

the princes and potentates being the only patrons of art.  If a grandly

gifted man may drag his pride and his manhood in the dirt for bread

rather than starve with the nobility that is in him untainted, the excuse

is a valid one.  It would excuse theft in Washingtons and Wellingtons,

and unchastity in women as well.



But somehow, I can not keep that Medici mausoleum out of my memory.  It

is as large as a church; its pavement is rich enough for the pavement of

a King's palace; its great dome is gorgeous with frescoes; its walls are

made of--what?  Marble?--plaster?--wood?--paper?  No.  Red porphyry--

verde antique--jasper--oriental agate--alabaster--mother-of-pearl--

chalcedony--red coral--lapis lazuli!  All the vast walls are made wholly

of these precious stones, worked in, and in and in together in elaborate

pattern s and figures, and polished till they glow like great mirrors

with the pictured splendors reflected from the dome overhead.  And before

a statue of one of those dead Medicis reposes a crown that blazes with

diamonds and emeralds enough to buy a ship-of-the-line, almost.  These

are the things the Government has its evil eye upon, and a happy thing it

will be for Italy when they melt away in the public treasury.



And now----.  However, another beggar approaches.  I will go out and

destroy him, and then come back and write another chapter of

vituperation.



Having eaten the friendless orphan--having driven away his comrades--

having grown calm and reflective at length--I now feel in a kindlier

mood.  I feel that after talking so freely about the priests and the

churches, justice demands that if I know any thing good about either I

ought to say it.  I have heard of many things that redound to the credit

of the priesthood, but the most notable matter that occurs to me now is

the devotion one of the mendicant orders showed during the prevalence of

the cholera last year.  I speak of the Dominican friars--men who wear a

coarse, heavy brown robe and a cowl, in this hot climate, and go

barefoot.  They live on alms altogether, I believe.  They must

unquestionably love their religion, to suffer so much for it.  When the

cholera was raging in Naples; when the people were dying by hundreds and

hundreds every day; when every concern for the public welfare was

swallowed up in selfish private interest, and every citizen made the

taking care of himself his sole object, these men banded themselves

together and went about nursing the sick and burying the dead.  Their

noble efforts cost many of them their lives.  They laid them down

cheerfully, and well they might.  Creeds mathematically precise, and

hair-splitting niceties of doctrine, are absolutely necessary for the

salvation of some kinds of souls, but surely the charity, the purity, the

unselfishness that are in the hearts of men like these would save their

souls though they were bankrupt in the true religion--which is ours.



One of these fat bare-footed rascals came here to Civita Vecchia with us

in the little French steamer.  There were only half a dozen of us in the

cabin.  He belonged in the steerage.  He was the life of the ship, the

bloody-minded son of the Inquisition!  He and the leader of the marine

band of a French man-of-war played on the piano and sang opera turn

about; they sang duets together; they rigged impromptu theatrical

costumes and gave us extravagant farces and pantomimes.  We got along

first-rate with the friar, and were excessively conversational, albeit he

could not understand what we said, and certainly he never uttered a word

that we could guess the meaning of.



This Civita Vecchia is the finest nest of dirt, vermin and ignorance we

have found yet, except that African perdition they call Tangier, which is

just like it.  The people here live in alleys two yards wide, which have

a smell about them which is peculiar but not entertaining.  It is well

the alleys are not wider, because they hold as much smell now as a person

can stand, and of course, if they were wider they would hold more, and

then the people would die.  These alleys are paved with stone, and

carpeted with deceased cats, and decayed rags, and decomposed vegetable-

tops, and remnants of old boots, all soaked with dish-water, and the

people sit around on stools and enjoy it.  They are indolent, as a

general thing, and yet have few pastimes.  They work two or three hours

at a time, but not hard, and then they knock off and catch flies.  This

does not require any talent, because they only have to grab--if they do

not get the one they are after, they get another.  It is all the same to

them.  They have no partialities.  Whichever one they get is the one they

want.



They have other kinds of insects, but it does not make them arrogant.

They are very quiet, unpretending people.  They have more of these kind

of things than other communities, but they do not boast.



They are very uncleanly--these people--in face, in person and dress.

When they see any body with a clean shirt on, it arouses their scorn.

The women wash clothes, half the day, at the public tanks in the streets,

but they are probably somebody else's.  Or may be they keep one set to

wear and another to wash; because they never put on any that have ever

been washed.  When they get done washing, they sit in the alleys and

nurse their cubs.  They nurse one ash-cat at a time, and the others

scratch their backs against the door-post and are happy.



All this country belongs to the Papal States.  They do not appear to have

any schools here, and only one billiard table.  Their education is at a

very low stage.  One portion of the men go into the military, another

into the priesthood, and the rest into the shoe-making business.



They keep up the passport system here, but so they do in Turkey.  This

shows that the Papal States are as far advanced as Turkey.  This fact

will be alone sufficient to silence the tongues of malignant

calumniators.  I had to get my passport vised for Rome in Florence, and

then they would not let me come ashore here until a policeman had

examined it on the wharf and sent me a permit.  They did not even dare to

let me take my passport in my hands for twelve hours, I looked so

formidable.  They judged it best to let me cool down.  They thought I

wanted to take the town, likely.  Little did they know me.  I wouldn't

have it.  They examined my baggage at the depot.  They took one of my

ablest jokes and read it over carefully twice and then read it backwards.

But it was too deep for them.  They passed it around, and every body

speculated on it awhile, but it mastered them all.



It was no common joke.  At length a veteran officer spelled it over

deliberately and shook his head three or four times and said that in his

opinion it was seditious.  That was the first time I felt alarmed.  I

immediately said I would explain the document, and they crowded around.

And so I explained and explained and explained, and they took notes of

all I said, but the more I explained the more they could not understand

it, and when they desisted at last, I could not even understand it

myself.  They said they believed it was an incendiary document, leveled

at the government.  I declared solemnly that it was not, but they only

shook their heads and would not be satisfied.  Then they consulted a good

while; and finally they confiscated it.  I was very sorry for this,

because I had worked a long time on that joke, and took a good deal of

pride in it, and now I suppose I shall never see it any more.  I suppose

it will be sent up and filed away among the criminal archives of Rome,

and will always be regarded as a mysterious infernal machine which would

have blown up like a mine and scattered the good Pope all around, but for

a miraculous providential interference.  And I suppose that all the time

I am in Rome the police will dog me about from place to place because

they think I am a dangerous character.



It is fearfully hot in Civita Vecchia.  The streets are made very narrow

and the houses built very solid and heavy and high, as a protection

against the heat.  This is the first Italian town I have seen which does

not appear to have a patron saint.  I suppose no saint but the one that

went up in the chariot of fire could stand the climate.



There is nothing here to see.  They have not even a cathedral, with

eleven tons of solid silver archbishops in the back room; and they do not

show you any moldy buildings that are seven thousand years old; nor any

smoke-dried old fire-screens which are chef d'oeuvres of Reubens or

Simpson, or Titian or Ferguson, or any of those parties; and they haven't

any bottled fragments of saints, and not even a nail from the true cross.

We are going to Rome.  There is nothing to see here.









CHAPTER XXVI.



What is it that confers the noblest delight?  What is that which swells a

man's breast with pride above that which any other experience can bring

to him?  Discovery!  To know that you are walking where none others have

walked; that you are beholding what human eye has not seen before; that

you are breathing a virgin atmosphere.  To give birth to an idea--to

discover a great thought--an intellectual nugget, right under the dust of

a field that many a brain--plow had gone over before.  To find a new

planet, to invent a new hinge, to find the way to make the lightnings

carry your messages.  To be the first--that is the idea.  To do

something, say something, see something, before any body else--these are

the things that confer a pleasure compared with which other pleasures are

tame and commonplace, other ecstasies cheap and trivial.  Morse, with his

first message, brought by his servant, the lightning; Fulton, in that

long-drawn century of suspense, when he placed his hand upon the

throttle-valve and lo, the steamboat moved; Jenner, when his patient with

the cow's virus in his blood, walked through the smallpox hospitals

unscathed; Howe, when the idea shot through his brain that for a hundred

and twenty generations the eye had been bored through the wrong end of

the needle; the nameless lord of art who laid down his chisel in some old

age that is forgotten, now, and gloated upon the finished Laocoon;

Daguerre, when he commanded the sun, riding in the zenith, to print the

landscape upon his insignificant silvered plate, and he obeyed; Columbus,

in the Pinta's shrouds, when he swung his hat above a fabled sea and

gazed abroad upon an unknown world!  These are the men who have really

lived--who have actually comprehended what pleasure is--who have crowded

long lifetimes of ecstasy into a single moment.



What is there in Rome for me to see that others have not seen before me?

What is there for me to touch that others have not touched?  What is

there for me to feel, to learn, to hear, to know, that shall thrill me

before it pass to others?  What can I discover?--Nothing.  Nothing

whatsoever.  One charm of travel dies here.  But if I were only a Roman!

--If, added to my own I could be gifted with modern Roman sloth, modern

Roman superstition, and modern Roman boundlessness of ignorance, what

bewildering worlds of unsuspected wonders I would discover!  Ah, if I

were only a habitant of the Campagna five and twenty miles from Rome!

Then I would travel.



I would go to America, and see, and learn, and return to the Campagna and

stand before my countrymen an illustrious discoverer.  I would say:



"I saw there a country which has no overshadowing Mother Church, and yet

the people survive.  I saw a government which never was protected by

foreign soldiers at a cost greater than that required to carry on the

government itself.  I saw common men and common women who could read;

I even saw small children of common country people reading from books;

if I dared think you would believe it, I would say they could write,

also.



"In the cities I saw people drinking a delicious beverage made of chalk

and water, but never once saw goats driven through their Broadway or

their Pennsylvania Avenue or their Montgomery street and milked at the

doors of the houses.  I saw real glass windows in the houses of even the

commonest people.  Some of the houses are not of stone, nor yet of

bricks; I solemnly swear they are made of wood.  Houses there will take

fire and burn, sometimes--actually burn entirely down, and not leave a

single vestige behind.  I could state that for a truth, upon my death-

bed.  And as a proof that the circumstance is not rare, I aver that they

have a thing which they call a fire-engine, which vomits forth great

streams of water, and is kept always in readiness, by night and by day,

to rush to houses that are burning.  You would think one engine would be

sufficient, but some great cities have a hundred; they keep men hired,

and pay them by the month to do nothing but put out fires.  For a certain

sum of money other men will insure that your house shall not burn down;

and if it burns they will pay you for it.  There are hundreds and

thousands of schools, and any body may go and learn to be wise, like a

priest.  In that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he is

damned; he can not buy salvation with money for masses.  There is really

not much use in being rich, there.  Not much use as far as the other

world is concerned, but much, very much use, as concerns this; because

there, if a man be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become a

legislator, a governor, a general, a senator, no matter how ignorant an

ass he is--just as in our beloved Italy the nobles hold all the great

places, even though sometimes they are born noble idiots.  There, if a

man be rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to feasts, they

invite him to drink complicated beverages; but if he be poor and in debt,

they require him to do that which they term to "settle."  The women put

on a different dress almost every day; the dress is usually fine, but

absurd in shape; the very shape and fashion of it changes twice in a

hundred years; and did I but covet to be called an extravagant falsifier,

I would say it changed even oftener.  Hair does not grow upon the

American women's heads; it is made for them by cunning workmen in the

shops, and is curled and frizzled into scandalous and ungodly forms.

Some persons wear eyes of glass which they see through with facility

perhaps, else they would not use them; and in the mouths of some are

teeth made by the sacrilegious hand of man.  The dress of the men is

laughably grotesque.  They carry no musket in ordinary life, nor no long-

pointed pole; they wear no wide green-lined cloak; they wear no peaked

black felt hat, no leathern gaiters reaching to the knee, no goat-skin

breeches with the hair side out, no hob-nailed shoes, no prodigious

spurs.  They wear a conical hat termed a "nail-kag;" a coat of saddest

black; a shirt which shows dirt so easily that it has to be changed every

month, and is very troublesome; things called pantaloons, which are held

up by shoulder straps, and on their feet they wear boots which are

ridiculous in pattern and can stand no wear.  Yet dressed in this

fantastic garb, these people laughed at my costume.  In that country,

books are so common that it is really no curiosity to see one.

Newspapers also.  They have a great machine which prints such things by

thousands every hour.



"I saw common men, there--men who were neither priests nor princes--who

yet absolutely owned the land they tilled.  It was not rented from the

church, nor from the nobles.  I am ready to take my oath of this.  In

that country you might fall from a third story window three several

times, and not mash either a soldier or a priest.--The scarcity of such

people is astonishing.  In the cities you will see a dozen civilians for

every soldier, and as many for every priest or preacher.  Jews, there,

are treated just like human beings, instead of dogs.  They can work at

any business they please; they can sell brand new goods if they want to;

they can keep drug-stores; they can practice medicine among Christians;

they can even shake hands with Christians if they choose; they can

associate with them, just the same as one human being does with another

human being; they don't have to stay shut up in one corner of the towns;

they can live in any part of a town they like best; it is said they even

have the privilege of buying land and houses, and owning them themselves,

though I doubt that, myself; they never have had to run races naked

through the public streets, against jackasses, to please the people in

carnival time; there they never have been driven by the soldiers into a

church every Sunday for hundreds of years to hear themselves and their

religion especially and particularly cursed; at this very day, in that

curious country, a Jew is allowed to vote, hold office, yea, get up on a

rostrum in the public street and express his opinion of the government if

the government don't suit him!  Ah, it is wonderful.  The common people

there know a great deal; they even have the effrontery to complain if

they are not properly governed, and to take hold and help conduct the

government themselves; if they had laws like ours, which give one dollar

of every three a crop produces to the government for taxes, they would

have that law altered: instead of paying thirty-three dollars in taxes,

out of every one hundred they receive, they complain if they have to pay

seven.  They are curious people.  They do not know when they are well

off.  Mendicant priests do not prowl among them with baskets begging for

the church and eating up their substance.  One hardly ever sees a

minister of the gospel going around there in his bare feet, with a

basket, begging for subsistence.  In that country the preachers are not

like our mendicant orders of friars--they have two or three suits of

clothing, and they wash sometimes.  In that land are mountains far higher

than the Alban mountains; the vast Roman Campagna, a hundred miles long

and full forty broad, is really small compared to the United States of

America; the Tiber, that celebrated river of ours, which stretches its

mighty course almost two hundred miles, and which a lad can scarcely

throw a stone across at Rome, is not so long, nor yet so wide, as the

American Mississippi--nor yet the Ohio, nor even the Hudson.  In America

the people are absolutely wiser and know much more than their

grandfathers did.  They do not plow with a sharpened stick, nor yet with

a three-cornered block of wood that merely scratches the top of the

ground.  We do that because our fathers did, three thousand years ago, I

suppose.  But those people have no holy reverence for their ancestors.

They plow with a plow that is a sharp, curved blade of iron, and it cuts

into the earth full five inches.  And this is not all.  They cut their

grain with a horrid machine that mows down whole fields in a day.  If I

dared, I would say that sometimes they use a blasphemous plow that works

by fire and vapor and tears up an acre of ground in a single hour--but--

but--I see by your looks that you do not believe the things I am telling

you.  Alas, my character is ruined, and I am a branded speaker of

untruths!"



Of course we have been to the monster Church of St. Peter, frequently.

I knew its dimensions.  I knew it was a prodigious structure.  I knew it

was just about the length of the capitol at Washington--say seven hundred

and thirty feet.  I knew it was three hundred and sixty-four feet wide,

and consequently wider than the capitol.  I knew that the cross on the

top of the dome of the church was four hundred and thirty-eight feet

above the ground, and therefore about a hundred or may be a hundred and

twenty-five feet higher than the dome of the capitol.--Thus I had one

gauge.  I wished to come as near forming a correct idea of how it was

going to look, as possible; I had a curiosity to see how much I would

err.  I erred considerably.  St. Peter's did not look nearly so large as

the capitol, and certainly not a twentieth part as beautiful, from the

outside.



When we reached the door, and stood fairly within the church, it was

impossible to comprehend that it was a very large building.  I had to

cipher a comprehension of it.  I had to ransack my memory for some more

similes.  St. Peter's is bulky.  Its height and size would represent two

of the Washington capitol set one on top of the other--if the capitol

were wider; or two blocks or two blocks and a half of ordinary buildings

set one on top of the other.  St. Peter's was that large, but it could

and would not look so.  The trouble was that every thing in it and about

it was on such a scale of uniform vastness that there were no contrasts

to judge by--none but the people, and I had not noticed them.  They were

insects.  The statues of children holding vases of holy water were

immense, according to the tables of figures, but so was every thing else

around them.  The mosaic pictures in the dome were huge, and were made of

thousands and thousands of cubes of glass as large as the end of my

little finger, but those pictures looked smooth, and gaudy of color, and

in good proportion to the dome.  Evidently they would not answer to

measure by.  Away down toward the far end of the church (I thought it was

really clear at the far end, but discovered afterward that it was in the

centre, under the dome,) stood the thing they call the baldacchino--a

great bronze pyramidal frame-work like that which upholds a mosquito bar.

It only looked like a considerably magnified bedstead--nothing more.  Yet

I knew it was a good deal more than half as high as Niagara Falls.  It

was overshadowed by a dome so mighty that its own height was snubbed.

The four great square piers or pillars that stand equidistant from each

other in the church, and support the roof, I could not work up to their

real dimensions by any method of comparison.  I knew that the faces of

each were about the width of a very large dwelling-house front, (fifty or

sixty feet,) and that they were twice as high as an ordinary three-story

dwelling, but still they looked small.  I tried all the different ways I

could think of to compel myself to understand how large St. Peter's was,

but with small success.  The mosaic portrait of an Apostle who was

writing with a pen six feet long seemed only an ordinary Apostle.



But the people attracted my attention after a while.  To stand in the

door of St. Peter's and look at men down toward its further extremity,

two blocks away, has a diminishing effect on them; surrounded by the

prodigious pictures and statues, and lost in the vast spaces, they look

very much smaller than they would if they stood two blocks away in the

open air.  I "averaged" a man as he passed me and watched him as he

drifted far down by the baldacchino and beyond--watched him dwindle to an

insignificant school-boy, and then, in the midst of the silent throng of

human pigmies gliding about him, I lost him.  The church had lately been

decorated, on the occasion of a great ceremony in honor of St. Peter, and

men were engaged, now, in removing the flowers and gilt paper from the

walls and pillars.  As no ladders could reach the great heights, the men

swung themselves down from balustrades and the capitals of pilasters by

ropes, to do this work.  The upper gallery which encircles the inner

sweep of the dome is two hundred and forty feet above the floor of the

church--very few steeples in America could reach up to it.  Visitors

always go up there to look down into the church because one gets the best

idea of some of the heights and distances from that point.  While we

stood on the floor one of the workmen swung loose from that gallery at

the end of a long rope.  I had not supposed, before, that a man could

look so much like a spider.  He was insignificant in size, and his rope

seemed only a thread.  Seeing that he took up so little space, I could

believe the story, then, that ten thousand troops went to St. Peter's,

once, to hear mass, and their commanding officer came afterward, and not

finding them, supposed they had not yet arrived.  But they were in the

church, nevertheless--they were in one of the transepts.  Nearly fifty

thousand persons assembled in St. Peter's to hear the publishing of the

dogma of the Immaculate Conception.  It is estimated that the floor of

the church affords standing room for--for a large number of people; I

have forgotten the exact figures.  But it is no matter--it is near

enough.



They have twelve small pillars, in St. Peter's, which came from Solomon's

Temple.  They have, also--which was far more interesting to me--a piece

of the true cross, and some nails, and a part of the crown of thorns.



Of course we ascended to the summit of the dome, and of course we also

went up into the gilt copper ball which is above it.--There was room

there for a dozen persons, with a little crowding, and it was as close

and hot as an oven.  Some of those people who are so fond of writing

their names in prominent places had been there before us--a million or

two, I should think.  From the dome of St. Peter's one can see every

notable object in Rome, from the Castle of St. Angelo to the Coliseum.

He can discern the seven hills upon which Rome is built.  He can see the

Tiber, and the locality of the bridge which Horatius kept "in the brave

days of old" when Lars Porsena attempted to cross it with his invading

host.  He can see the spot where the Horatii and the Curatii fought their

famous battle.  He can see the broad green Campagna, stretching away

toward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of

the olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintily

festooned with vines.  He can see the Alban Mountains, the Appenines, the

Sabine Hills, and the blue Mediterranean.  He can see a panorama that is

varied, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in history

than any other in Europe.--About his feet is spread the remnant of a

city that once had a population of four million souls; and among its

massed edifices stand the ruins of temples, columns, and triumphal arches

that knew the Caesars, and the noonday of Roman splendor; and close by

them, in unimpaired strength, is a drain of arched and heavy masonry that

belonged to that older city which stood here before Romulus and Remus

were born or Rome thought of.  The Appian Way is here yet, and looking

much as it did, perhaps, when the triumphal processions of the Emperors

moved over it in other days bringing fettered princes from the confines

of the earth.  We can not see the long array of chariots and mail-clad

men laden with the spoils of conquest, but we can imagine the pageant,

after a fashion.  We look out upon many objects of interest from the dome

of St. Peter's; and last of all, almost at our feet, our eyes rest upon

the building which was once the Inquisition.  How times changed, between

the older ages and the new!  Some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago,

the ignorant men of Rome were wont to put Christians in the arena of the

Coliseum yonder, and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show.  It

was for a lesson as well.  It was to teach the people to abhor and fear

the new doctrine the followers of Christ were teaching.  The beasts tore

the victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in the

twinkling of an eye.  But when the Christians came into power, when the

holy Mother Church became mistress of the barbarians, she taught them the

error of their ways by no such means.  No, she put them in this pleasant

Inquisition and pointed to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so

merciful toward all men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and

they did all they could to persuade them to love and honor him--first by

twisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their

flesh with pincers--red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable

in cold weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by

roasting them in public.  They always convinced those barbarians.  The

true religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to

administer it, is very, very soothing.  It is wonderfully persuasive,

also.  There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts

and stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition.  One is the

system of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened, civilized

people.  It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.



I prefer not to describe St. Peter's.  It has been done before.  The

ashes of Peter, the disciple of the Saviour, repose in a crypt under the

baldacchino.  We stood reverently in that place; so did we also in the

Mamertine Prison, where he was confined, where he converted the soldiers,

and where tradition says he caused a spring of water to flow in order

that he might baptize them.  But when they showed us the print of Peter's

face in the hard stone of the prison wall and said he made that by

falling up against it, we doubted.  And when, also, the monk at the

church of San Sebastian showed us a paving-stone with two great

footprints in it and said that Peter's feet made those, we lacked

confidence again.  Such things do not impress one.  The monk said that

angels came and liberated Peter from prison by night, and he started away

from Rome by the Appian Way.  The Saviour met him and told him to go

back, which he did.  Peter left those footprints in the stone upon which

he stood at the time.  It was not stated how it was ever discovered whose

footprints they were, seeing the interview occurred secretly and at

night.  The print of the face in the prison was that of a man of common

size; the footprints were those of a man ten or twelve feet high.  The

discrepancy confirmed our unbelief.



We necessarily visited the Forum, where Caesar was assassinated, and also

the Tarpeian Rock.  We saw the Dying Gladiator at the Capitol, and I

think that even we appreciated that wonder of art; as much, perhaps, as

we did that fearful story wrought in marble, in the Vatican--the Laocoon.

And then the Coliseum.



Every body knows the picture of the Coliseum; every body recognizes at

once that "looped and windowed" band-box with a side bitten out.  Being

rather isolated, it shows to better advantage than any other of the

monuments of ancient Rome.  Even the beautiful Pantheon, whose pagan

altars uphold the cross, now, and whose Venus, tricked out in consecrated

gimcracks, does reluctant duty as a Virgin Mary to-day, is built about

with shabby houses and its stateliness sadly marred.  But the monarch of

all European ruins, the Coliseum, maintains that reserve and that royal

seclusion which is proper to majesty.  Weeds and flowers spring from its

massy arches and its circling seats, and vines hang their fringes from

its lofty walls.  An impressive silence broods over the monstrous

structure where such multitudes of men and women were wont to assemble in

other days.  The butterflies have taken the places of the queens of

fashion and beauty of eighteen centuries ago, and the lizards sun

themselves in the sacred seat of the Emperor.  More vividly than all the

written histories, the Coliseum tells the story of Rome's grandeur and

Rome's decay.  It is the worthiest type of both that exists.  Moving

about the Rome of to-day, we might find it hard to believe in her old

magnificence and her millions of population; but with this stubborn

evidence before us that she was obliged to have a theatre with sitting

room for eighty thousand persons and standing room for twenty thousand

more, to accommodate such of her citizens as required amusement, we find

belief less difficult.  The Coliseum is over one thousand six hundred

feet long, seven hundred and fifty wide, and one hundred and sixty-five

high.  Its shape is oval.



In America we make convicts useful at the same time that we punish them

for their crimes.  We farm them out and compel them to earn money for the

State by making barrels and building roads.  Thus we combine business

with retribution, and all things are lovely.  But in ancient Rome they

combined religious duty with pleasure.  Since it was necessary that the

new sect called Christians should be exterminated, the people judged it

wise to make this work profitable to the State at the same time, and

entertaining to the public.  In addition to the gladiatorial combats and

other shows, they sometimes threw members of the hated sect into the

arena of the Coliseum and turned wild beasts in upon them.  It is

estimated that seventy thousand Christians suffered martyrdom in this

place.  This has made the Coliseum holy ground, in the eyes of the

followers of the Saviour.  And well it might; for if the chain that bound

a saint, and the footprints a saint has left upon a stone he chanced to

stand upon, be holy, surely the spot where a man gave up his life for his

faith is holy.



Seventeen or eighteen centuries ago this Coliseum was the theatre of

Rome, and Rome was mistress of the world.  Splendid pageants were

exhibited here, in presence of the Emperor, the great ministers of State,

the nobles, and vast audiences of citizens of smaller consequence.

Gladiators fought with gladiators and at times with warrior prisoners

from many a distant land.  It was the theatre of Rome--of the world--and

the man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintentional

manner something about "my private box at the Coliseum" could not move in

the first circles.  When the clothing-store merchant wished to consume

the corner grocery man with envy, he bought secured seats in the front

row and let the thing be known.  When the irresistible dry goods clerk

wished to blight and destroy, according to his native instinct, he got

himself up regardless of expense and took some other fellow's young lady

to the Coliseum, and then accented the affront by cramming her with ice

cream between the acts, or by approaching the cage and stirring up the

martyrs with his whalebone cane for her edification.  The Roman swell was

in his true element only when he stood up against a pillar and fingered

his moustache unconscious of the ladies; when he viewed the bloody

combats through an opera-glass two inches long; when he excited the envy

of provincials by criticisms which showed that he had been to the

Coliseum many and many a time and was long ago over the novelty of it;

when he turned away with a yawn at last and said,



"He a star! handles his sword like an apprentice brigand!  he'll do for

the country, may be, but he don't answer for the metropolis!"



Glad was the contraband that had a seat in the pit at the Saturday

matinee, and happy the Roman street-boy who ate his peanuts and guyed the

gladiators from the dizzy gallery.



For me was reserved the high honor of discovering among the rubbish of

the ruined Coliseum the only playbill of that establishment now extant.

There was a suggestive smell of mint-drops about it still, a corner of it

had evidently been chewed, and on the margin, in choice Latin, these

words were written in a delicate female hand:



     "Meet me on the Tarpeian Rock tomorrow evening, dear, at sharp

     seven.  Mother will be absent on a visit to her friends in the

     Sabine Hills.        CLAUDIA."



Ah, where is that lucky youth to-day, and where the little hand that

wrote those dainty lines?  Dust and ashes these seventeen hundred years!



Thus reads the bill:





                            ROMAN COLISEUM.

It was as singular as it was gratifying that I was also so fortunate as

to find among the rubbish of the arena, a stained and mutilated copy of

the Roman Daily Battle-Ax, containing a critique upon this very

performance.  It comes to hand too late by many centuries to rank as

news, and therefore I translate and publish it simply to show how very

little the general style and phraseology of dramatic criticism has

altered in the ages that have dragged their slow length along since the

carriers laid this one damp and fresh before their Roman patrons:



     "THE OPENING SEASON.--COLISEUM.--Notwithstanding the inclemency of

     the weather, quite a respectable number of the rank and fashion of

     the city assembled last night to witness the debut upon metropolitan

     boards of the young tragedian who has of late been winning such

     golden opinions in the amphitheatres of the provinces.  Some sixty

     thousand persons were present, and but for the fact that the streets

     were almost impassable, it is fair to presume that the house would

     have been full.  His august Majesty, the Emperor Aurelius, occupied

     the imperial box, and was the cynosure of all eyes.  Many

     illustrious nobles and generals of the Empire graced the occasion

     with their presence, and not the least among them was the young

     patrician lieutenant whose laurels, won in the ranks of the

     "Thundering Legion," are still so green upon his brow.  The cheer

     which greeted his entrance was heard beyond the Tiber!



     "The late repairs and decorations add both to the comeliness and the

     comfort of the Coliseum.  The new cushions are a great improvement

     upon the hard marble seats we have been so long accustomed to.  The

     present management deserve well of the public.  They have restored

     to the Coliseum the gilding, the rich upholstery and the uniform

     magnificence which old Coliseum frequenters tell us Rome was so

     proud of fifty years ago.



     "The opening scene last night--the broadsword combat between two

     young amateurs and a famous Parthian gladiator who was sent here a

     prisoner--was very fine.  The elder of the two young gentlemen

     handled his weapon with a grace that marked the possession of

     extraordinary talent.  His feint of thrusting, followed instantly by

     a happily delivered blow which unhelmeted the Parthian, was received

     with hearty applause.  He was not thoroughly up in the backhanded

     stroke, but it was very gratifying to his numerous friends to know

     that, in time, practice would have overcome this defect.  However,

     he was killed.  His sisters, who were present, expressed

     considerable regret.  His mother left the Coliseum.  The other youth

     maintained the contest with such spirit as to call forth

     enthusiastic bursts of applause.  When at last he fell a corpse, his

     aged mother ran screaming, with hair disheveled and tears streaming

     from her eyes, and swooned away just as her hands were clutching at

     the railings of the arena.  She was promptly removed by the police.

     Under the circumstances the woman's conduct was pardonable, perhaps,

     but we suggest that such exhibitions interfere with the decorum

     which should be preserved during the performances, and are highly

     improper in the presence of the Emperor.  The Parthian prisoner

     fought bravely and well; and well he might, for he was fighting for

     both life and liberty.  His wife and children were there to nerve

     his arm with their love, and to remind him of the old home he should

     see again if he conquered.  When his second assailant fell, the

     woman clasped her children to her breast and wept for joy.  But it

     was only a transient happiness.  The captive staggered toward her

     and she saw that the liberty he had earned was earned too late.  He

     was wounded unto death.  Thus the first act closed in a manner which

     was entirely satisfactory.  The manager was called before the

     curtain and returned his thanks for the honor done him, in a speech

     which was replete with wit and humor, and closed by hoping that his

     humble efforts to afford cheerful and instructive entertainment

     would continue to meet with the approbation of the Roman public



     "The star now appeared, and was received with vociferous applause

     and the simultaneous waving of sixty thousand handkerchiefs.  Marcus

     Marcellus Valerian (stage name--his real name is Smith,) is a

     splendid specimen of physical development, and an artist of rare

     merit.  His management of the battle-ax is wonderful.  His gayety

     and his playfulness are irresistible, in his comic parts, and yet

     they are inferior to his sublime conceptions in the grave realm of

     tragedy.  When his ax was describing fiery circles about the heads

     of the bewildered barbarians, in exact time with his springing body

     and his prancing legs, the audience gave way to uncontrollable

     bursts of laughter; but when the back of his weapon broke the skull

     of one and almost in the same instant its edge clove the other's

     body in twain, the howl of enthusiastic applause that shook the

     building, was the acknowledgment of a critical assemblage that he

     was a master of the noblest department of his profession.  If he has

     a fault, (and we are sorry to even intimate that he has,) it is that

     of glancing at the audience, in the midst of the most exciting

     moments of the performance, as if seeking admiration.  The pausing

     in a fight to bow when bouquets are thrown to him is also in bad

     taste.  In the great left-handed combat he appeared to be looking at

     the audience half the time, instead of carving his adversaries; and

     when he had slain all the sophomores and was dallying with the

     freshman, he stooped and snatched a bouquet as it fell, and offered

     it to his adversary at a time when a blow was descending which

     promised favorably to be his death-warrant.  Such levity is proper

     enough in the provinces, we make no doubt, but it ill suits the

     dignity of the metropolis.  We trust our young friend will take

     these remarks in good part, for we mean them solely for his benefit.

     All who know us are aware that although we are at times justly

     severe upon tigers and martyrs, we never intentionally offend

     gladiators.



     "The Infant Prodigy performed wonders.  He overcame his four tiger

     whelps with ease, and with no other hurt than the loss of a portion

     of his scalp.  The General Slaughter was rendered with a

     faithfulness to details which reflects the highest credit upon the

     late participants in it.



     "Upon the whole, last night's performances shed honor not only upon

     the management but upon the city that encourages and sustains such

     wholesome and instructive entertainments.  We would simply suggest

     that the practice of vulgar young boys in the gallery of shying

     peanuts and paper pellets at the tigers, and saying "Hi-yi!" and

     manifesting approbation or dissatisfaction by such observations as

     "Bully for the lion!"  "Go it, Gladdy!"  "Boots!"  "Speech!"  "Take

     a walk round the block!"  and so on, are extremely reprehensible,

     when the Emperor is present, and ought to be stopped by the police.

     Several times last night, when the supernumeraries entered the arena

     to drag out the bodies, the young ruffians in the gallery shouted,

     "Supe!  supe!"  and also, "Oh, what a coat!"  and "Why don't you pad

     them shanks?"  and made use of various other remarks expressive of

     derision.  These things are very annoying to the audience.



     "A matinee for the little folks is promised for this afternoon, on

     which occasion several martyrs will be eaten by the tigers.  The

     regular performance will continue every night till further notice.

     Material change of programme every evening.  Benefit of Valerian,

     Tuesday, 29th, if he lives."





I have been a dramatic critic myself, in my time, and I was often

surprised to notice how much more I knew about Hamlet than Forrest did;

and it gratifies me to observe, now, how much better my brethren of

ancient times knew how a broad sword battle ought to be fought than the

gladiators.









CHAPTER XXVII.



So far, good.  If any man has a right to feel proud of himself, and

satisfied, surely it is I.  For I have written about the Coliseum, and

the gladiators, the martyrs, and the lions, and yet have never once used

the phrase "butchered to make a Roman holiday."  I am the only free white

man of mature age, who has accomplished this since Byron originated the

expression.



Butchered to make a Roman holiday sounds well for the first seventeen or

eighteen hundred thousand times one sees it in print, but after that it

begins to grow tiresome.  I find it in all the books concerning Rome--and

here latterly it reminds me of Judge Oliver.  Oliver was a young lawyer,

fresh from the schools, who had gone out to the deserts of Nevada to

begin life.  He found that country, and our ways of life, there, in those

early days, different from life in New England or Paris.  But he put on a

woollen shirt and strapped a navy revolver to his person, took to the

bacon and beans of the country, and determined to do in Nevada as Nevada

did.  Oliver accepted the situation so completely that although he must

have sorrowed over many of his trials, he never complained--that is, he

never complained but once.  He, two others, and myself, started to the

new silver mines in the Humboldt mountains--he to be Probate Judge of

Humboldt county, and we to mine.  The distance was two hundred miles.  It

was dead of winter.  We bought a two-horse wagon and put eighteen hundred

pounds of bacon, flour, beans, blasting-powder, picks and shovels in it;

we bought two sorry-looking Mexican "plugs," with the hair turned the

wrong way and more corners on their bodies than there are on the mosque

of Omar; we hitched up and started.  It was a dreadful trip.  But Oliver

did not complain.  The horses dragged the wagon two miles from town and

then gave out.  Then we three pushed the wagon seven miles, and Oliver

moved ahead and pulled the horses after him by the bits.  We complained,

but Oliver did not.  The ground was frozen, and it froze our backs while

we slept; the wind swept across our faces and froze our noses.  Oliver

did not complain.  Five days of pushing the wagon by day and freezing by

night brought us to the bad part of the journey--the Forty Mile Desert,

or the Great American Desert, if you please.  Still, this mildest-

mannered man that ever was, had not complained.  We started across at

eight in the morning, pushing through sand that had no bottom; toiling

all day long by the wrecks of a thousand wagons, the skeletons of ten

thousand oxen; by wagon-tires enough to hoop the Washington Monument to

the top, and ox-chains enough to girdle Long Island; by human graves;

with our throats parched always, with thirst; lips bleeding from the

alkali dust; hungry, perspiring, and very, very weary--so weary that when

we dropped in the sand every fifty yards to rest the horses, we could

hardly keep from going to sleep--no complaints from Oliver: none the next

morning at three o'clock, when we got across, tired to death.



Awakened two or three nights afterward at midnight, in a narrow canon, by

the snow falling on our faces, and appalled at the imminent danger of

being "snowed in," we harnessed up and pushed on till eight in the

morning, passed the "Divide" and knew we were saved.  No complaints.

Fifteen days of hardship and fatigue brought us to the end of the two

hundred miles, and the Judge had not complained.  We wondered if any

thing could exasperate him.  We built a Humboldt house.  It is done in

this way.  You dig a square in the steep base of the mountain, and set up

two uprights and top them with two joists.  Then you stretch a great

sheet of "cotton domestic" from the point where the joists join the hill-

side down over the joists to the ground; this makes the roof and the

front of the mansion; the sides and back are the dirt walls your digging

has left.  A chimney is easily made by turning up one corner of the roof.

Oliver was sitting alone in this dismal den, one night, by a sage-brush

fire, writing poetry; he was very fond of digging poetry out of himself--

or blasting it out when it came hard.  He heard an animal's footsteps

close to the roof; a stone or two and some dirt came through and fell by

him.  He grew uneasy and said "Hi!--clear out from there, can't you!"--

from time to time.  But by and by he fell asleep where he sat, and pretty

soon a mule fell down the chimney!  The fire flew in every direction, and

Oliver went over backwards.  About ten nights after that, he recovered

confidence enough to go to writing poetry again.  Again he dozed off to

sleep, and again a mule fell down the chimney.  This time, about half of

that side of the house came in with the mule.  Struggling to get up, the

mule kicked the candle out and smashed most of the kitchen furniture, and

raised considerable dust.  These violent awakenings must have been

annoying to Oliver, but he never complained.  He moved to a mansion on

the opposite side of the canon, because he had noticed the mules did not

go there.  One night about eight o'clock he was endeavoring to finish his

poem, when a stone rolled in--then a hoof appeared below the canvas--then

part of a cow--the after part.  He leaned back in dread, and shouted

"Hooy!  hooy!  get out of this!"  and the cow struggled manfully--lost

ground steadily--dirt and dust streamed down, and before Oliver could get

well away, the entire cow crashed through on to the table and made a

shapeless wreck of every thing!



Then, for the first time in his life, I think, Oliver complained.  He

said,



"This thing is growing monotonous!"



Then he resigned his judgeship and left Humboldt county.  "Butchered to

make a Roman holyday" has grown monotonous to me.



In this connection I wish to say one word about Michael Angelo

Buonarotti.  I used to worship the mighty genius of Michael Angelo--that

man who was great in poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture--great in

every thing he undertook.  But I do not want Michael Angelo for

breakfast--for luncheon--for dinner--for tea--for supper--for between

meals.  I like a change, occasionally.  In Genoa, he designed every

thing; in Milan he or his pupils designed every thing; he designed the

Lake of Como; in Padua, Verona, Venice, Bologna, who did we ever hear of,

from guides, but Michael Angelo?  In Florence, he painted every thing,

designed every thing, nearly, and what he did not design he used to sit

on a favorite stone and look at, and they showed us the stone.  In Pisa

he designed every thing but the old shot-tower, and they would have

attributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out of the

perpendicular.  He designed the piers of Leghorn and the custom house

regulations of Civita Vecchia.  But, here--here it is frightful.  He

designed St. Peter's; he designed the Pope; he designed the Pantheon, the

uniform of the Pope's soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican, the Coliseum, the

Capitol, the Tarpeian Rock, the Barberini Palace, St. John Lateran, the

Campagna, the Appian Way, the Seven Hills, the Baths of Caracalla, the

Claudian Aqueduct, the Cloaca Maxima--the eternal bore designed the

Eternal City, and unless all men and books do lie, he painted every thing

in it!  Dan said the other day to the guide, "Enough, enough, enough!

Say no more!  Lump the whole thing!  say that the Creator made Italy from

designs by Michael Angelo!"



I never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filled

with a blessed peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that Michael

Angelo was dead.



But we have taken it out of this guide.  He has marched us through miles

of pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the Vatican; and

through miles of pictures and sculpture in twenty other palaces; he has

shown us the great picture in the Sistine Chapel, and frescoes enough to

frescoe the heavens--pretty much all done by Michael Angelo.  So with him

we have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for us--

imbecility and idiotic questions.  These creatures never suspect--they

have no idea of a sarcasm.



He shows us a figure and says: "Statoo brunzo."  (Bronze statue.)



We look at it indifferently and the doctor asks: "By Michael Angelo?"



"No--not know who."



Then he shows us the ancient Roman Forum.  The doctor asks: "Michael

Angelo?"



A stare from the guide.  "No--thousan' year before he is born."



Then an Egyptian obelisk.  Again: "Michael Angelo?"



"Oh, mon dieu, genteelmen!  Zis is two thousan' year before he is born!"



He grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes, that he dreads to

show us any thing at all.  The wretch has tried all the ways he can think

of to make us comprehend that Michael Angelo is only responsible for the

creation of a part of the world, but somehow he has not succeeded yet.

Relief for overtasked eyes and brain from study and sightseeing is

necessary, or we shall become idiotic sure enough.  Therefore this guide

must continue to suffer.  If he does not enjoy it, so much the worse for

him.  We do.



In this place I may as well jot down a chapter concerning those necessary

nuisances, European guides.  Many a man has wished in his heart he could

do without his guide; but knowing he could not, has wished he could get

some amusement out of him as a remuneration for the affliction of his

society.  We accomplished this latter matter, and if our experience can

be made useful to others they are welcome to it.



Guides know about enough English to tangle every thing up so that a man

can make neither head or tail of it.  They know their story by heart--the

history of every statue, painting, cathedral or other wonder they show

you.  They know it and tell it as a parrot would--and if you interrupt,

and throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin over again.

All their lives long, they are employed in showing strange things to

foreigners and listening to their bursts of admiration.  It is human

nature to take delight in exciting admiration.  It is what prompts

children to say "smart" things, and do absurd ones, and in other ways

"show off" when company is present.  It is what makes gossips turn out in

rain and storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news.

Think, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose privilege it

is, every day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfect

ecstasies of admiration!  He gets so that he could not by any possibility

live in a soberer atmosphere.  After we discovered this, we never went

into ecstasies any more--we never admired any thing--we never showed any

but impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of the

sublimest wonders a guide had to display.  We had found their weak point.

We have made good use of it ever since.  We have made some of those

people savage, at times, but we have never lost our own serenity.



The doctor asks the questions, generally, because he can keep his

countenance, and look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more

imbecility into the tone of his voice than any man that lives.  It comes

natural to him.



The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American party, because

Americans so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotion

before any relic of Columbus.  Our guide there fidgeted about as if he

had swallowed a spring mattress.  He was full of animation--full of

impatience.  He said:



"Come wis me, genteelmen!--come!  I show you ze letter writing by

Christopher Colombo!--write it himself!--write it wis his own hand!--

come!"



He took us to the municipal palace.  After much impressive fumbling of

keys and opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spread

before us.  The guide's eyes sparkled.  He danced about us and tapped the

parchment with his finger:



"What I tell you, genteelmen!  Is it not so?  See!  handwriting

Christopher Colombo!--write it himself!"



We looked indifferent--unconcerned.  The doctor examined the document

very deliberately, during a painful pause.--Then he said, without any

show of interest:



"Ah--Ferguson--what--what did you say was the name of the party who wrote

this?"



"Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!"



Another deliberate examination.



"Ah--did he write it himself; or--or how?"



"He write it himself!--Christopher Colombo!  He's own hand-writing, write

by himself!"



Then the doctor laid the document down and said:



"Why, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could

write better than that."



"But zis is ze great Christo--"



"I don't care who it is!  It's the worst writing I ever saw.  Now you

musn't think you can impose on us because we are strangers.  We are not

fools, by a good deal.  If you have got any specimens of penmanship of

real merit, trot them out!--and if you haven't, drive on!"



We drove on.  The guide was considerably shaken up, but he made one more

venture.  He had something which he thought would overcome us.  He said:



"Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me!  I show you beautiful, O, magnificent

bust Christopher Colombo!--splendid, grand, magnificent!"



He brought us before the beautiful bust--for it was beautiful--and sprang

back and struck an attitude:



"Ah, look, genteelmen!--beautiful, grand,--bust Christopher Colombo!--

beautiful bust, beautiful pedestal!"



The doctor put up his eye-glass--procured for such occasions:



"Ah--what did you say this gentleman's name was?"



"Christopher Colombo!--ze great Christopher Colombo!"



"Christopher Colombo--the great Christopher Colombo.  Well, what did he

do?"



"Discover America!--discover America, Oh, ze devil!"



"Discover America.  No--that statement will hardly wash.  We are just

from America ourselves.  We heard nothing about it.  Christopher Colombo

--pleasant name--is--is he dead?"



"Oh, corpo di Baccho!--three hundred year!"



"What did he die of?"



"I do not know!--I can not tell."



"Small-pox, think?"



"I do not know, genteelmen!--I do not know what he die of!"



"Measles, likely?"



"May be--may be--I do not know--I think he die of somethings."



"Parents living?"



"Im-poseeeble!"



"Ah--which is the bust and which is the pedestal?"



"Santa Maria!--zis ze bust!--zis ze pedestal!"



"Ah, I see, I see--happy combination--very happy combination, indeed.

Is--is this the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust?"



That joke was lost on the foreigner--guides can not master the subtleties

of the American joke.



We have made it interesting for this Roman guide.  Yesterday we spent

three or four hours in the Vatican, again, that wonderful world of

curiosities.  We came very near expressing interest, sometimes--even

admiration--it was very hard to keep from it.  We succeeded though.

Nobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums.  The guide was bewildered--

non-plussed.  He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up extraordinary

things, and exhausted all his ingenuity on us, but it was a failure; we

never showed any interest in any thing.  He had reserved what he

considered to be his greatest wonder till the last--a royal Egyptian

mummy, the best preserved in the world, perhaps.  He took us there.  He

felt so sure, this time, that some of his old enthusiasm came back to

him:



"See, genteelmen!--Mummy!  Mummy!"



The eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.



"Ah,--Ferguson--what did I understand you to say the gentleman's name

was?"



"Name?--he got no name!--Mummy!--'Gyptian mummy!"



"Yes, yes.  Born here?"



"No!  'Gyptian mummy!"



"Ah, just so.  Frenchman, I presume?"



"No!--not Frenchman, not Roman!--born in Egypta!"



"Born in Egypta.  Never heard of Egypta before.  Foreign locality,

likely.  Mummy--mummy.  How calm he is--how self-possessed.  Is, ah--is

he dead?"



"Oh, sacre bleu, been dead three thousan' year!"



The doctor turned on him savagely:



"Here, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this!  Playing us for

Chinamen because we are strangers and trying to learn!  Trying to impose

your vile second-hand carcasses on us!--thunder and lightning, I've a

notion to--to--if you've got a nice fresh corpse, fetch him out!--or by

George we'll brain you!"



We make it exceedingly interesting for this Frenchman.  However, he has

paid us back, partly, without knowing it.  He came to the hotel this

morning to ask if we were up, and he endeavored as well as he could to

describe us, so that the landlord would know which persons he meant.  He

finished with the casual remark that we were lunatics.  The observation

was so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing for a

guide to say.



There is one remark (already mentioned,) which never yet has failed to

disgust these guides.  We use it always, when we can think of nothing

else to say.  After they have exhausted their enthusiasm pointing out to

us and praising the beauties of some ancient bronze image or broken-

legged statue, we look at it stupidly and in silence for five, ten,

fifteen minutes--as long as we can hold out, in fact--and then ask:



"Is--is he dead?"



That conquers the serenest of them.  It is not what they are looking for

--especially a new guide.  Our Roman Ferguson is the most patient,

unsuspecting, long-suffering subject we have had yet.  We shall be sorry

to part with him.  We have enjoyed his society very much.  We trust he

has enjoyed ours, but we are harassed with doubts.



We have been in the catacombs.  It was like going down into a very deep

cellar, only it was a cellar which had no end to it.  The narrow passages

are roughly hewn in the rock, and on each hand as you pass along, the

hollowed shelves are carved out, from three to fourteen deep; each held a

corpse once.  There are names, and Christian symbols, and prayers, or

sentences expressive of Christian hopes, carved upon nearly every

sarcophagus.  The dates belong away back in the dawn of the Christian

era, of course.  Here, in these holes in the ground, the first Christians

sometimes burrowed to escape persecution.  They crawled out at night to

get food, but remained under cover in the day time.  The priest told us

that St. Sebastian lived under ground for some time while he was being

hunted; he went out one day, and the soldiery discovered and shot him to

death with arrows.  Five or six of the early Popes--those who reigned

about sixteen hundred years ago--held their papal courts and advised with

their clergy in the bowels of the earth.  During seventeen years--from

A.D. 235 to A.D. 252--the Popes did not appear above ground.  Four were

raised to the great office during that period.  Four years apiece, or

thereabouts.  It is very suggestive of the unhealthiness of underground

graveyards as places of residence.  One Pope afterward spent his entire

pontificate in the catacombs--eight years.  Another was discovered in

them and murdered in the episcopal chair.  There was no satisfaction in

being a Pope in those days.  There were too many annoyances.  There are

one hundred and sixty catacombs under Rome, each with its maze of narrow

passages crossing and recrossing each other and each passage walled to

the top with scooped graves its entire length.  A careful estimate makes

the length of the passages of all the catacombs combined foot up nine

hundred miles, and their graves number seven millions.  We did not go

through all the passages of all the catacombs.  We were very anxious to

do it, and made the necessary arrangements, but our too limited time

obliged us to give up the idea.  So we only groped through the dismal

labyrinth of St. Callixtus, under the Church of St. Sebastian.  In the

various catacombs are small chapels rudely hewn in the stones, and here

the early Christians often held their religious services by dim, ghostly

lights.  Think of mass and a sermon away down in those tangled caverns

under ground!



In the catacombs were buried St. Cecilia, St. Agnes, and several other of

the most celebrated of the saints.  In the catacomb of St. Callixtus, St.

Bridget used to remain long hours in holy contemplation, and St. Charles

Borromeo was wont to spend whole nights in prayer there.  It was also the

scene of a very marvelous thing.



     "Here the heart of St. Philip Neri was so inflamed with divine love

     as to burst his ribs."



I find that grave statement in a book published in New York in 1808, and

written by "Rev. William H. Neligan, LL.D., M. A., Trinity College,

Dublin; Member of the Archaeological Society of Great Britain."

Therefore, I believe it.  Otherwise, I could not.  Under other

circumstances I should have felt a curiosity to know what Philip had for

dinner.



This author puts my credulity on its mettle every now and then.  He tells

of one St. Joseph Calasanctius whose house in Rome he visited; he visited

only the house--the priest has been dead two hundred years.  He says the

Virgin Mary appeared to this saint.  Then he continues:



     "His tongue and his heart, which were found after nearly a century

     to be whole, when the body was disinterred before his canonization,

     are still preserved in a glass case, and after two centuries the

     heart is still whole.  When the French troops came to Rome, and when

     Pius VII. was carried away prisoner, blood dropped from it."



To read that in a book written by a monk far back in the Middle Ages,

would surprise no one; it would sound natural and proper; but when it is

seriously stated in the middle of the nineteenth century, by a man of

finished education, an LL.D., M. A., and an Archaeological magnate, it

sounds strangely enough.  Still, I would gladly change my unbelief for

Neligan's faith, and let him make the conditions as hard as he pleased.



The old gentleman's undoubting, unquestioning simplicity has a rare

freshness about it in these matter-of-fact railroading and telegraphing

days.  Hear him, concerning the church of Ara Coeli:



     "In the roof of the church, directly above the high altar, is

     engraved, 'Regina Coeli laetare Alleluia."  In the sixth century

     Rome was visited by a fearful pestilence.  Gregory the Great urged

     the people to do penance, and a general procession was formed.  It

     was to proceed from Ara Coeli to St. Peter's.  As it passed before

     the mole of Adrian, now the Castle of St. Angelo, the sound of

     heavenly voices was heard singing (it was Easter morn,) Regina

     Coeli, laetare!  alleluia!  quia quem meruisti portare, alleluia!

     resurrexit sicut dixit; alleluia!"  The Pontiff, carrying in his

     hands the portrait of the Virgin, (which is over the high altar and

     is said to have been painted by St. Luke,) answered, with the

     astonished people, 'Ora pro nobis Deum, alleluia!'  At the same time

     an angel was seen to put up a sword in a scabbard, and the

     pestilence ceased on the same day.  There are four circumstances

     which 'CONFIRM'--[The italics are mine--M. T.]--this miracle: the

     annual procession which takes place in the western church on the

     feast of St Mark; the statue of St. Michael, placed on the mole of

     Adrian, which has since that time been called the Castle of St.

     Angelo; the antiphon Regina Coeli which the Catholic church sings

     during paschal time; and the inscription in the church."









CHAPTER XXVIII.



From the sanguinary sports of the Holy Inquisition; the slaughter of the

Coliseum; and the dismal tombs of the Catacombs, I naturally pass to the

picturesque horrors of the Capuchin Convent.  We stopped a moment in a

small chapel in the church to admire a picture of St. Michael vanquishing

Satan--a picture which is so beautiful that I can not but think it

belongs to the reviled "Renaissance," notwithstanding I believe they told

us one of the ancient old masters painted it--and then we descended into

the vast vault underneath.



Here was a spectacle for sensitive nerves!  Evidently the old masters had

been at work in this place.  There were six divisions in the apartment,

and each division was ornamented with a style of decoration peculiar to

itself--and these decorations were in every instance formed of human

bones!  There were shapely arches, built wholly of thigh bones; there

were startling pyramids, built wholly of grinning skulls; there were

quaint architectural structures of various kinds, built of shin bones and

the bones of the arm; on the wall were elaborate frescoes, whose curving

vines were made of knotted human vertebrae; whose delicate tendrils were

made of sinews and tendons; whose flowers were formed of knee-caps and

toe-nails.  Every lasting portion of the human frame was represented in

these intricate designs (they were by Michael Angelo, I think,) and there

was a careful finish about the work, and an attention to details that

betrayed the artist's love of his labors as well as his schooled ability.

I asked the good-natured monk who accompanied us, who did this?  And he

said, "We did it"--meaning himself and his brethren up stairs.  I could

see that the old friar took a high pride in his curious show.  We made

him talkative by exhibiting an interest we never betrayed to guides.



"Who were these people?"



"We--up stairs--Monks of the Capuchin order--my brethren."



"How many departed monks were required to upholster these six parlors?"



"These are the bones of four thousand."



"It took a long time to get enough?"



"Many, many centuries."



"Their different parts are well separated--skulls in one room, legs in

another, ribs in another--there would be stirring times here for a while

if the last trump should blow.  Some of the brethren might get hold of

the wrong leg, in the confusion, and the wrong skull, and find themselves

limping, and looking through eyes that were wider apart or closer

together than they were used to.  You can not tell any of these parties

apart, I suppose?"



"Oh, yes, I know many of them."



He put his finger on a skull.  "This was Brother Anselmo--dead three

hundred years--a good man."



He touched another.  "This was Brother Alexander--dead two hundred and

eighty years.  This was Brother Carlo--dead about as long."



Then he took a skull and held it in his hand, and looked reflectively

upon it, after the manner of the grave-digger when he discourses of

Yorick.



"This," he said, "was Brother Thomas.  He was a young prince, the scion

of a proud house that traced its lineage back to the grand old days of

Rome well nigh two thousand years ago.  He loved beneath his estate.  His

family persecuted him; persecuted the girl, as well.  They drove her from

Rome; he followed; he sought her far and wide; he found no trace of her.

He came back and offered his broken heart at our altar and his weary life

to the service of God.  But look you.  Shortly his father died, and

likewise his mother.  The girl returned, rejoicing.  She sought every

where for him whose eyes had used to look tenderly into hers out of this

poor skull, but she could not find him.  At last, in this coarse garb we

wear, she recognized him in the street.  He knew her.  It was too late.

He fell where he stood.  They took him up and brought him here.  He never

spoke afterward.  Within the week he died.  You can see the color of his

hair--faded, somewhat--by this thin shred that clings still to the

temple.  This, [taking up a thigh bone,] was his.  The veins of this

leaf in the decorations over your head, were his finger-joints, a hundred

and fifty years ago."



This business-like way of illustrating a touching story of the heart by

laying the several fragments of the lover before us and naming them, was

as grotesque a performance, and as ghastly, as any I ever witnessed.  I

hardly knew whether to smile or shudder.  There are nerves and muscles in

our frames whose functions and whose methods of working it seems a sort

of sacrilege to describe by cold physiological names and surgical

technicalities, and the monk's talk suggested to me something of this

kind.  Fancy a surgeon, with his nippers lifting tendons, muscles and

such things into view, out of the complex machinery of a corpse, and

observing, "Now this little nerve quivers--the vibration is imparted to

this muscle--from here it is passed to this fibrous substance; here its

ingredients are separated by the chemical action of the blood--one part

goes to the heart and thrills it with what is popularly termed emotion,

another part follows this nerve to the brain and communicates

intelligence of a startling character--the third part glides along this

passage and touches the spring connected with the fluid receptacles that

lie in the rear of the eye.  Thus, by this simple and beautiful process,

the party is informed that his mother is dead, and he weeps."  Horrible!



I asked the monk if all the brethren up stairs expected to be put in this

place when they died.  He answered quietly:



"We must all lie here at last."



See what one can accustom himself to.--The reflection that he must some

day be taken apart like an engine or a clock, or like a house whose owner

is gone, and worked up into arches and pyramids and hideous frescoes, did

not distress this monk in the least.  I thought he even looked as if he

were thinking, with complacent vanity, that his own skull would look well

on top of the heap and his own ribs add a charm to the frescoes which

possibly they lacked at present.



Here and there, in ornamental alcoves, stretched upon beds of bones, lay

dead and dried-up monks, with lank frames dressed in the black robes one

sees ordinarily upon priests.  We examined one closely.  The skinny hands

were clasped upon the breast; two lustreless tufts of hair stuck to the

skull; the skin was brown and sunken; it stretched tightly over the cheek

bones and made them stand out sharply; the crisp dead eyes were deep in

the sockets; the nostrils were painfully prominent, the end of the nose

being gone; the lips had shriveled away from the yellow teeth: and

brought down to us through the circling years, and petrified there, was a

weird laugh a full century old!



It was the jolliest laugh, but yet the most dreadful, that one can

imagine.  Surely, I thought, it must have been a most extraordinary joke

this veteran produced with his latest breath, that he has not got done

laughing at it yet.  At this moment I saw that the old instinct was

strong upon the boys, and I said we had better hurry to St. Peter's.

They were trying to keep from asking, "Is--is he dead?"



It makes me dizzy, to think of the Vatican--of its wilderness of statues,

paintings, and curiosities of every description and every age.  The "old

masters" (especially in sculpture,) fairly swarm, there.  I can not write

about the Vatican.  I think I shall never remember any thing I saw there

distinctly but the mummies, and the Transfiguration, by Raphael, and some

other things it is not necessary to mention now.  I shall remember the

Transfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself;

partly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting in

the world; and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful.  The colors

are fresh and rich, the "expression," I am told, is fine, the "feeling"

is lively, the "tone" is good, the "depth" is profound, and the width is

about four and a half feet, I should judge.  It is a picture that really

holds one's attention; its beauty is fascinating.  It is fine enough to

be a Renaissance.  A remark I made a while ago suggests a thought--and a

hope.  Is it not possible that the reason I find such charms in this

picture is because it is out of the crazy chaos of the galleries?  If

some of the others were set apart, might not they be beautiful?  If this

were set in the midst of the tempest of pictures one finds in the vast

galleries of the Roman palaces, would I think it so handsome?  If, up to

this time, I had seen only one "old master" in each palace, instead of

acres and acres of walls and ceilings fairly papered with them, might I

not have a more civilized opinion of the old masters than I have now?  I

think so.  When I was a school-boy and was to have a new knife, I could

not make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the show-case, and I

did not think any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with a

heavy heart.  But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where no

glittering blades came into competition with it, I was astonished to see

how handsome it was.  To this day my new hats look better out of the shop

than they did in it with other new hats.  It begins to dawn upon me, now,

that possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in the

galleries may be uniform beauty after all.  I honestly hope it is, to

others, but certainly it is not to me.  Perhaps the reason I used to

enjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because there

were but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to go

through the list.  I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in the

Forty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteen

courses.  One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteen

frighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.



There is one thing I am certain of, though.  With all the Michael

Angelos, the Raphaels, the Guidos and the other old masters, the sublime

history of Rome remains unpainted!  They painted Virgins enough, and

popes enough and saintly scarecrows enough, to people Paradise, almost,

and these things are all they did paint.  "Nero fiddling o'er burning

Rome," the assassination of Caesar, the stirring spectacle of a hundred

thousand people bending forward with rapt interest, in the coliseum, to

see two skillful gladiators hacking away each others' lives, a tiger

springing upon a kneeling martyr--these and a thousand other matters

which we read of with a living interest, must be sought for only in

books--not among the rubbish left by the old masters--who are no more, I

have the satisfaction of informing the public.



They did paint, and they did carve in marble, one historical scene, and

one only, (of any great historical consequence.) And what was it and why

did they choose it, particularly?  It was the Rape of the Sabines, and

they chose it for the legs and busts.



I like to look at statues, however, and I like to look at pictures, also

--even of monks looking up in sacred ecstacy, and monks looking down in

meditation, and monks skirmishing for something to eat--and therefore I

drop ill nature to thank the papal government for so jealously guarding

and so industriously gathering up these things; and for permitting me, a

stranger and not an entirely friendly one, to roam at will and unmolested

among them, charging me nothing, and only requiring that I shall behave

myself simply as well as I ought to behave in any other man's house.  I

thank the Holy Father right heartily, and I wish him long life and plenty

of happiness.



The Popes have long been the patrons and preservers of art, just as our

new, practical Republic is the encourager and upholder of mechanics.  In

their Vatican is stored up all that is curious and beautiful in art; in

our Patent Office is hoarded all that is curious or useful in mechanics.

When a man invents a new style of horse-collar or discovers a new and

superior method of telegraphing, our government issues a patent to him

that is worth a fortune; when a man digs up an ancient statue in the

Campagna, the Pope gives him a fortune in gold coin.  We can make

something of a guess at a man's character by the style of nose he carries

on his face.  The Vatican and the Patent Office are governmental noses,

and they bear a deal of character about them.



The guide showed us a colossal statue of Jupiter, in the Vatican, which

he said looked so damaged and rusty--so like the God of the Vagabonds--

because it had but recently been dug up in the Campagna.  He asked how

much we supposed this Jupiter was worth?  I replied, with intelligent

promptness, that he was probably worth about four dollars--may be four

and a half.  "A hundred thousand dollars!"  Ferguson said.  Ferguson

said, further, that the Pope permits no ancient work of this kind to

leave his dominions.  He appoints a commission to examine discoveries

like this and report upon the value; then the Pope pays the discoverer

one-half of that assessed value and takes the statue.  He said this

Jupiter was dug from a field which had just been bought for thirty-six

thousand dollars, so the first crop was a good one for the new farmer.

I do not know whether Ferguson always tells the truth or not, but I

suppose he does.  I know that an exorbitant export duty is exacted upon

all pictures painted by the old masters, in order to discourage the sale

of those in the private collections.  I am satisfied, also, that genuine

old masters hardly exist at all, in America, because the cheapest and

most insignificant of them are valued at the price of a fine farm.  I

proposed to buy a small trifle of a Raphael, myself, but the price of it

was eighty thousand dollars, the export duty would have made it

considerably over a hundred, and so I studied on it awhile and concluded

not to take it.



I wish here to mention an inscription I have seen, before I forget it:



"Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth TO MEN OF GOOD WILL!"  It is

not good scripture, but it is sound Catholic and human nature.



This is in letters of gold around the apsis of a mosaic group at the side

of the 'scala santa', church of St. John Lateran, the Mother and Mistress

of all the Catholic churches of the world.  The group represents the

Saviour, St. Peter, Pope Leo, St. Silvester, Constantine and Charlemagne.

Peter is giving the pallium to the Pope, and a standard to Charlemagne.

The Saviour is giving the keys to St. Silvester, and a standard to

Constantine.  No prayer is offered to the Saviour, who seems to be of

little importance any where in Rome; but an inscription below says,

"Blessed Peter, give life to Pope Leo and victory to king Charles."  It

does not say, "Intercede for us, through the Saviour, with the Father,

for this boon," but "Blessed Peter, give it us."



In all seriousness--without meaning to be frivolous--without meaning to

be irreverent, and more than all, without meaning to be blasphemous,--I

state as my simple deduction from the things I have seen and the things I

have heard, that the Holy Personages rank thus in Rome:



First--"The Mother of God"--otherwise the Virgin Mary.



Second--The Deity.



Third--Peter.



Fourth--Some twelve or fifteen canonized Popes and martyrs.



Fifth--Jesus Christ the Saviour--(but always as an infant in arms.)



I may be wrong in this--my judgment errs often, just as is the case with

other men's--but it is my judgment, be it good or bad.



Just here I will mention something that seems curious to me.  There are

no "Christ's Churches" in Rome, and no "Churches of the Holy Ghost," that

I can discover.  There are some four hundred churches, but about a fourth

of them seem to be named for the Madonna and St. Peter.  There are so

many named for Mary that they have to be distinguished by all sorts of

affixes, if I understand the matter rightly.  Then we have churches of

St. Louis; St. Augustine; St. Agnes; St. Calixtus; St. Lorenzo in Lucina;

St. Lorenzo in Damaso; St. Cecilia; St. Athanasius; St. Philip Neri; St.

Catherine, St. Dominico, and a multitude of lesser saints whose names are

not familiar in the world--and away down, clear out of the list of the

churches, comes a couple of hospitals: one of them is named for the

Saviour and the other for the Holy Ghost!



Day after day and night after night we have wandered among the crumbling

wonders of Rome; day after day and night after night we have fed upon the

dust and decay of five-and-twenty centuries--have brooded over them by

day and dreampt of them by night till sometimes we seemed moldering away

ourselves, and growing defaced and cornerless, and liable at any moment

to fall a prey to some antiquary and be patched in the legs, and

"restored" with an unseemly nose, and labeled wrong and dated wrong, and

set up in the Vatican for poets to drivel about and vandals to scribble

their names on forever and forevermore.



But the surest way to stop writing about Rome is to stop.  I wished to

write a real "guide-book" chapter on this fascinating city, but I could

not do it, because I have felt all the time like a boy in a candy-shop--

there was every thing to choose from, and yet no choice.  I have drifted

along hopelessly for a hundred pages of manuscript without knowing where

to commence.  I will not commence at all.  Our passports have been

examined.  We will go to Naples.









CHAPTER XXIX.



The ship is lying here in the harbor of Naples--quarantined.  She has

been here several days and will remain several more.  We that came by

rail from Rome have escaped this misfortune.  Of course no one is allowed

to go on board the ship, or come ashore from her.  She is a prison, now.

The passengers probably spend the long, blazing days looking out from

under the awnings at Vesuvius and the beautiful city--and in swearing.

Think of ten days of this sort of pastime!--We go out every day in a boat

and request them to come ashore.  It soothes them.  We lie ten steps from

the ship and tell them how splendid the city is; and how much better the

hotel fare is here than any where else in Europe; and how cool it is; and

what frozen continents of ice cream there are; and what a time we are

having cavorting about the country and sailing to the islands in the Bay.

This tranquilizes them.



                           ASCENT OF VESUVIUS.



I shall remember our trip to Vesuvius for many a day--partly because of

its sight-seeing experiences, but chiefly on account of the fatigue of

the journey.  Two or three of us had been resting ourselves among the

tranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of Ischia, eighteen miles

out in the harbor, for two days; we called it "resting," but I do not

remember now what the resting consisted of, for when we got back to

Naples we had not slept for forty-eight hours.  We were just about to go

to bed early in the evening, and catch up on some of the sleep we had

lost, when we heard of this Vesuvius expedition.  There was to be eight

of us in the party, and we were to leave Naples at midnight.  We laid in

some provisions for the trip, engaged carriages to take us to

Annunciation, and then moved about the city, to keep awake, till twelve.

We got away punctually, and in the course of an hour and a half arrived

at the town of Annunciation.  Annunciation is the very last place under

the sun.  In other towns in Italy the people lie around quietly and wait

for you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be charged

for--but in Annunciation they have lost even that fragment of delicacy;

they seize a lady's shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charge a

penny; they open a carriage door, and charge for it--shut it when you get

out, and charge for it; they help you to take off a duster--two cents;

brush your clothes and make them worse than they were before--two cents;

smile upon you--two cents; bow, with a lick-spittle smirk, hat in hand--

two cents; they volunteer all information, such as that the mules will

arrive presently--two cents--warm day, sir--two cents--take you four

hours to make the ascent--two cents.  And so they go.  They crowd you--

infest you--swarm about you, and sweat and smell offensively, and look

sneaking and mean, and obsequious.  There is no office too degrading for

them to perform, for money.  I have had no opportunity to find out any

thing about the upper classes by my own observation, but from what I hear

said about them I judge that what they lack in one or two of the bad

traits the canaille have, they make up in one or two others that are

worse.  How the people beg!--many of them very well dressed, too.



I said I knew nothing against the upper classes by personal observation.

I must recall it!  I had forgotten.  What I saw their bravest and their

fairest do last night, the lowest multitude that could be scraped up out

of the purlieus of Christendom would blush to do, I think.  They

assembled by hundreds, and even thousands, in the great Theatre of San

Carlo, to do--what?  Why, simply, to make fun of an old woman--to deride,

to hiss, to jeer at an actress they once worshipped, but whose beauty is

faded now and whose voice has lost its former richness.  Every body spoke

of the rare sport there was to be.  They said the theatre would be

crammed, because Frezzolini was going to sing.  It was said she could not

sing well, now, but then the people liked to see her, anyhow.  And so we

went.  And every time the woman sang they hissed and laughed--the whole

magnificent house--and as soon as she left the stage they called her on

again with applause.  Once or twice she was encored five and six times in

succession, and received with hisses when she appeared, and discharged

with hisses and laughter when she had finished--then instantly encored

and insulted again!  And how the high-born knaves enjoyed it!  White-

kidded gentlemen and ladies laughed till the tears came, and clapped

their hands in very ecstacy when that unhappy old woman would come meekly

out for the sixth time, with uncomplaining patience, to meet a storm of

hisses!  It was the cruelest exhibition--the most wanton, the most

unfeeling.  The singer would have conquered an audience of American

rowdies by her brave, unflinching tranquillity (for she answered encore

after encore, and smiled and bowed pleasantly, and sang the best she

possibly could, and went bowing off, through all the jeers and hisses,

without ever losing countenance or temper:) and surely in any other land

than Italy her sex and her helplessness must have been an ample

protection to her--she could have needed no other.  Think what a

multitude of small souls were crowded into that theatre last night.  If

the manager could have filled his theatre with Neapolitan souls alone,

without the bodies, he could not have cleared less than ninety millions

of dollars.  What traits of character must a man have to enable him to

help three thousand miscreants to hiss, and jeer, and laugh at one

friendless old woman, and shamefully humiliate her?  He must have all the

vile, mean traits there are.  My observation persuades me (I do not like

to venture beyond my own personal observation,) that the upper classes of

Naples possess those traits of character.  Otherwise they may be very

good people; I can not say.





                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



In this city of Naples, they believe in and support one of the

wretchedest of all the religious impostures one can find in Italy--the

miraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius.  Twice a year the

priests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out this vial

of clotted blood and let them see it slowly dissolve and become liquid--

and every day for eight days, this dismal farce is repeated, while the

priests go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibition.  The

first day, the blood liquefies in forty-seven minutes--the church is

crammed, then, and time must be allowed the collectors to get around:

after that it liquefies a little quicker and a little quicker, every day,

as the houses grow smaller, till on the eighth day, with only a few

dozens present to see the miracle, it liquefies in four minutes.



And here, also, they used to have a grand procession, of priests,

citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries of the City

Government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up Madonna--a

stuffed and painted image, like a milliner's dummy--whose hair

miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months.  They still

kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years ago.  It

was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the remarkable

effigy, and the ceremony of the public barbering of her was always

carried out with the greatest possible eclat and display--the more the

better, because the more excitement there was about it the larger the

crowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last a

day came when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the

City Government stopped the Madonna's annual show.



There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the silliest

possible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfully

believed, and the other half either believed also or else said nothing

about, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture.  I am

very well satisfied to think the whole population believed in those poor,

cheap miracles--a people who want two cents every time they bow to you,

and who abuse a woman, are capable of it, I think.





                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



These Neapolitans always ask four times as much money as they intend to

take, but if you give them what they first demand, they feel ashamed of

themselves for aiming so low, and immediately ask more.  When money is to

be paid and received, there is always some vehement jawing and

gesticulating about it.  One can not buy and pay for two cents' worth of

clams without trouble and a quarrel.  One "course," in a two-horse

carriage, costs a franc--that is law--but the hackman always demands

more, on some pretence or other, and if he gets it he makes a new demand.

It is said that a stranger took a one-horse carriage for a course--

tariff, half a franc.  He gave the man five francs, by way of experiment.

He demanded more, and received another franc.  Again he demanded more,

and got a franc--demanded more, and it was refused.  He grew vehement--

was again refused, and became noisy.  The stranger said, "Well, give me

the seven francs again, and I will see what I can do"--and when he got

them, he handed the hackman half a franc, and he immediately asked for

two cents to buy a drink with.  It may be thought that I am prejudiced.



Perhaps I am.  I would be ashamed of myself if I were not.





                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



Well, as I was saying, we got our mules and horses, after an hour and a

half of bargaining with the population of Annunciation, and started

sleepily up the mountain, with a vagrant at each mule's tail who

pretended to be driving the brute along, but was really holding on and

getting himself dragged up instead.  I made slow headway at first, but I

began to get dissatisfied at the idea of paying my minion five francs to

hold my mule back by the tail and keep him from going up the hill, and so

I discharged him.  I got along faster then.



We had one magnificent picture of Naples from a high point on the

mountain side.  We saw nothing but the gas lamps, of course--two-thirds

of a circle, skirting the great Bay--a necklace of diamonds glinting up

through the darkness from the remote distance--less brilliant than the

stars overhead, but more softly, richly beautiful--and over all the great

city the lights crossed and recrossed each other in many and many a

sparkling line and curve.  And back of the town, far around and abroad

over the miles of level campagna, were scattered rows, and circles, and

clusters of lights, all glowing like so many gems, and marking where a

score of villages were sleeping.  About this time, the fellow who was

hanging on to the tail of the horse in front of me and practicing all

sorts of unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, got kicked some fourteen

rods, and this incident, together with the fairy spectacle of the lights

far in the distance, made me serenely happy, and I was glad I started to

Vesuvius.





                  ASCENT OF MOUNT VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



This subject will be excellent matter for a chapter, and tomorrow or next

day I will write it.









CHAPTER XXX.



                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



"See Naples and die."  Well, I do not know that one would necessarily die

after merely seeing it, but to attempt to live there might turn out a

little differently.  To see Naples as we saw it in the early dawn from

far up on the side of Vesuvius, is to see a picture of wonderful beauty.

At that distance its dingy buildings looked white--and so, rank on rank

of balconies, windows and roofs, they piled themselves up from the blue

ocean till the colossal castle of St. Elmo topped the grand white pyramid

and gave the picture symmetry, emphasis and completeness.  And when its

lilies turned to roses--when it blushed under the sun's first kiss--it

was beautiful beyond all description.  One might well say, then, "See

Naples and die."  The frame of the picture was charming, itself.  In

front, the smooth sea--a vast mosaic of many colors; the lofty islands

swimming in a dreamy haze in the distance; at our end of the city the

stately double peak of Vesuvius, and its strong black ribs and seams of

lava stretching down to the limitless level campagna--a green carpet that

enchants the eye and leads it on and on, past clusters of trees, and

isolated houses, and snowy villages, until it shreds out in a fringe of

mist and general vagueness far away.  It is from the Hermitage, there on

the side of Vesuvius, that one should "see Naples and die."



But do not go within the walls and look at it in detail.  That takes away

some of the romance of the thing.  The people are filthy in their habits,

and this makes filthy streets and breeds disagreeable sights and smells.

There never was a community so prejudiced against the cholera as these

Neapolitans are.  But they have good reason to be.  The cholera generally

vanquishes a Neapolitan when it seizes him, because, you understand,

before the doctor can dig through the dirt and get at the disease the man

dies.  The upper classes take a sea-bath every day, and are pretty

decent.



The streets are generally about wide enough for one wagon, and how they

do swarm with people!  It is Broadway repeated in every street, in every

court, in every alley!  Such masses, such throngs, such multitudes of

hurrying, bustling, struggling humanity!  We never saw the like of it,

hardly even in New York, I think.  There are seldom any sidewalks, and

when there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without

caroming on him.  So everybody walks in the street--and where the street

is wide enough, carriages are forever dashing along.  Why a thousand

people are not run over and crippled every day is a mystery that no man

can solve.  But if there is an eighth wonder in the world, it must be the

dwelling-houses of Naples.  I honestly believe a good majority of them

are a hundred feet high!  And the solid brick walls are seven feet

through.  You go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the "first"

floor.  No, not nine, but there or thereabouts.  There is a little bird-

cage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up, up, up,

among the eternal clouds, where the roof is, and there is always somebody

looking out of every window--people of ordinary size looking out from the

first floor, people a shade smaller from the second, people that look a

little smaller yet from the third--and from thence upward they grow

smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution, till the folks

in the topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly tall martin-

box than any thing else.  The perspective of one of these narrow cracks

of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching away till they come

together in the distance like railway tracks; its clothes-lines crossing

over at all altitudes and waving their bannered raggedness over the

swarms of people below; and the white-dressed women perched in balcony

railings all the way from the pavement up to the heavens--a perspective

like that is really worth going into Neapolitan details to see.





                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



Naples, with its immediate suburbs, contains six hundred and twenty-five

thousand inhabitants, but I am satisfied it covers no more ground than an

American city of one hundred and fifty thousand.  It reaches up into the

air infinitely higher than three American cities, though, and there is

where the secret of it lies.  I will observe here, in passing, that the

contrasts between opulence and poverty, and magnificence and misery, are

more frequent and more striking in Naples than in Paris even.  One must

go to the Bois de Boulogne to see fashionable dressing, splendid

equipages and stunning liveries, and to the Faubourg St. Antoine to see

vice, misery, hunger, rags, dirt--but in the thoroughfares of Naples

these things are all mixed together.  Naked boys of nine years and the

fancy-dressed children of luxury; shreds and tatters, and brilliant

uniforms; jackass-carts and state-carriages; beggars, Princes and

Bishops, jostle each other in every street.  At six o'clock every

evening, all Naples turns out to drive on the 'Riviere di Chiaja',

(whatever that may mean;) and for two hours one may stand there and see

the motliest and the worst mixed procession go by that ever eyes beheld.

Princes (there are more Princes than policemen in Naples--the city is

infested with them)--Princes who live up seven flights of stairs and

don't own any principalities, will keep a carriage and go hungry; and

clerks, mechanics, milliners and strumpets will go without their dinners

and squander the money on a hack-ride in the Chiaja; the rag-tag and

rubbish of the city stack themselves up, to the number of twenty or

thirty, on a rickety little go-cart hauled by a donkey not much bigger

than a cat, and they drive in the Chiaja; Dukes and bankers, in sumptuous

carriages and with gorgeous drivers and footmen, turn out, also, and so

the furious procession goes.  For two hours rank and wealth, and

obscurity and poverty clatter along side by side in the wild procession,

and then go home serene, happy, covered with glory!



I was looking at a magnificent marble staircase in the King's palace, the

other day, which, it was said, cost five million francs, and I suppose it

did cost half a million, may be.  I felt as if it must be a fine thing to

live in a country where there was such comfort and such luxury as this.

And then I stepped out musing, and almost walked over a vagabond who was

eating his dinner on the curbstone--a piece of bread and a bunch of

grapes.  When I found that this mustang was clerking in a fruit

establishment (he had the establishment along with him in a basket,) at

two cents a day, and that he had no palace at home where he lived, I lost

some of my enthusiasm concerning the happiness of living in Italy.



This naturally suggests to me a thought about wages here.  Lieutenants in

the army get about a dollar a day, and common soldiers a couple of cents.

I only know one clerk--he gets four dollars a month.  Printers get six

dollars and a half a month, but I have heard of a foreman who gets

thirteen.



To be growing suddenly and violently rich, as this man is, naturally

makes him a bloated aristocrat.  The airs he puts on are insufferable.



And, speaking of wages, reminds me of prices of merchandise.  In Paris

you pay twelve dollars a dozen for Jouvin's best kid gloves; gloves of

about as good quality sell here at three or four dollars a dozen.  You

pay five and six dollars apiece for fine linen shirts in Paris; here and

in Leghorn you pay two and a half.  In Marseilles you pay forty dollars

for a first-class dress coat made by a good tailor, but in Leghorn you

can get a full dress suit for the same money.  Here you get handsome

business suits at from ten to twenty dollars, and in Leghorn you can get

an overcoat for fifteen dollars that would cost you seventy in New York.

Fine kid boots are worth eight dollars in Marseilles and four dollars

here.  Lyons velvets rank higher in America than those of Genoa.  Yet the

bulk of Lyons velvets you buy in the States are made in Genoa and

imported into Lyons, where they receive the Lyons stamp and are then

exported to America.  You can buy enough velvet in Genoa for twenty-five

dollars to make a five hundred dollar cloak in New York--so the ladies

tell me.  Of course these things bring me back, by a natural and easy

transition, to the



                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



And thus the wonderful Blue Grotto is suggested to me.  It is situated on

the Island of Capri, twenty-two miles from Naples.  We chartered a little

steamer and went out there.  Of course, the police boarded us and put us

through a health examination, and inquired into our politics, before they

would let us land.  The airs these little insect Governments put on are

in the last degree ridiculous.  They even put a policeman on board of our

boat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the Capri dominions.

They thought we wanted to steal the grotto, I suppose.  It was worth

stealing.  The entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide,

and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliff--the sea-wall.  You

enter in small boats--and a tight squeeze it is, too.  You can not go in

at all when the tide is up.  Once within, you find yourself in an arched

cavern about one hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twenty

wide, and about seventy high.  How deep it is no man knows.  It goes down

to the bottom of the ocean.  The waters of this placid subterranean lake

are the brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined.  They are as

transparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the richest

sky that ever bent over Italy.  No tint could be more ravishing, no

lustre more superb.  Throw a stone into the water, and the myriad of tiny

bubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical

fires.  Dip an oar, and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver,

tinted with blue.  Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased in an

armor more gorgeous than ever kingly Crusader wore.



Then we went to Ischia, but I had already been to that island and tired

myself to death "resting" a couple of days and studying human villainy,

with the landlord of the Grande Sentinelle for a model.  So we went to

Procida, and from thence to Pozzuoli, where St. Paul landed after he

sailed from Samos.  I landed at precisely the same spot where St. Paul

landed, and so did Dan and the others.  It was a remarkable coincidence.

St. Paul preached to these people seven days before he started to Rome.



Nero's Baths, the ruins of Baiae, the Temple of Serapis; Cumae, where the

Cumaen Sybil interpreted the oracles, the Lake Agnano, with its ancient

submerged city still visible far down in its depths--these and a hundred

other points of interest we examined with critical imbecility, but the

Grotto of the Dog claimed our chief attention, because we had heard and

read so much about it.  Every body has written about the Grotto del Cane

and its poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every tourist has

held a dog over its floor by the legs to test the capabilities of the

place.  The dog dies in a minute and a half--a chicken instantly.  As a

general thing, strangers who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until

they are called.  And then they don't either.  The stranger that ventures

to sleep there takes a permanent contract.  I longed to see this grotto.

I resolved to take a dog and hold him myself; suffocate him a little, and

time him; suffocate him some more and then finish him.  We reached the

grotto at about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at once to make the

experiments.  But now, an important difficulty presented itself.  We had

no dog.



                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.



At the Hermitage we were about fifteen or eighteen hundred feet above the

sea, and thus far a portion of the ascent had been pretty abrupt.  For

the next two miles the road was a mixture--sometimes the ascent was

abrupt and sometimes it was not: but one characteristic it possessed all

the time, without failure--without modification--it was all

uncompromisingly and unspeakably infamous.  It was a rough, narrow trail,

and led over an old lava flow--a black ocean which was tumbled into a

thousand fantastic shapes--a wild chaos of ruin, desolation, and

barrenness--a wilderness of billowy upheavals, of furious whirlpools, of

miniature mountains rent asunder--of gnarled and knotted, wrinkled and

twisted masses of blackness that mimicked branching roots, great vines,

trunks of trees, all interlaced and mingled together: and all these weird

shapes, all this turbulent panorama, all this stormy, far-stretching

waste of blackness, with its thrilling suggestiveness of life, of action,

of boiling, surging, furious motion, was petrified!--all stricken dead

and cold in the instant of its maddest rioting!--fettered, paralyzed, and

left to glower at heaven in impotent rage for evermore!



Finally we stood in a level, narrow valley (a valley that had been

created by the terrific march of some old time irruption) and on either

hand towered the two steep peaks of Vesuvius.  The one we had to climb--

the one that contains the active volcano--seemed about eight hundred or

one thousand feet high, and looked almost too straight-up-and-down for

any man to climb, and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on his

back.  Four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a sedan

chair, if you wish it, but suppose they were to slip and let you fall,--

is it likely that you would ever stop rolling?  Not this side of

eternity, perhaps.  We left the mules, sharpened our finger-nails, and

began the ascent I have been writing about so long, at twenty minutes to

six in the morning.  The path led straight up a rugged sweep of loose

chunks of pumice-stone, and for about every two steps forward we took, we

slid back one.  It was so excessively steep that we had to stop, every

fifty or sixty steps, and rest a moment.  To see our comrades, we had to

look very nearly straight up at those above us, and very nearly straight

down at those below.  We stood on the summit at last--it had taken an

hour and fifteen minutes to make the trip.



What we saw there was simply a circular crater--a circular ditch, if you

please--about two hundred feet deep, and four or five hundred feet wide,

whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference.  In the centre

of the great circus ring thus formed, was a torn and ragged upheaval a

hundred feet high, all snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and many

a brilliant and beautiful color, and the ditch inclosed this like the

moat of a castle, or surrounded it as a little river does a little

island, if the simile is better.  The sulphur coating of that island was

gaudy in the extreme--all mingled together in the richest confusion were

red, blue, brown, black, yellow, white--I do not know that there was a

color, or shade of a color, or combination of colors, unrepresented--and

when the sun burst through the morning mists and fired this tinted

magnificence, it topped imperial Vesuvius like a jeweled crown!



The crater itself--the ditch--was not so variegated in coloring, but yet,

in its softness, richness, and unpretentious elegance, it was more

charming, more fascinating to the eye.  There was nothing "loud" about

its well-bred and well-creased look.  Beautiful?  One could stand and

look down upon it for a week without getting tired of it.  It had the

semblance of a pleasant meadow, whose slender grasses and whose velvety

mosses were frosted with a shining dust, and tinted with palest green

that deepened gradually to the darkest hue of the orange leaf, and

deepened yet again into gravest brown, then faded into orange, then into

brightest gold, and culminated in the delicate pink of a new-blown rose.

Where portions of the meadow had sunk, and where other portions had been

broken up like an ice-floe, the cavernous openings of the one, and the

ragged upturned edges exposed by the other, were hung with a lace-work of

soft-tinted crystals of sulphur that changed their deformities into

quaint shapes and figures that were full of grace and beauty.



The walls of the ditch were brilliant with yellow banks of sulphur and

with lava and pumice-stone of many colors.  No fire was visible any

where, but gusts of sulphurous steam issued silently and invisibly from a

thousand little cracks and fissures in the crater, and were wafted to our

noses with every breeze.  But so long as we kept our nostrils buried in

our handkerchiefs, there was small danger of suffocation.



Some of the boys thrust long slips of paper down into holes and set them

on fire, and so achieved the glory of lighting their cigars by the flames

of Vesuvius, and others cooked eggs over fissures in the rocks and were

happy.



The view from the summit would have been superb but for the fact that the

sun could only pierce the mists at long intervals.  Thus the glimpses we

had of the grand panorama below were only fitful and unsatisfactory.



                               THE DESCENT.



The descent of the mountain was a labor of only four minutes.  Instead of

stalking down the rugged path we ascended, we chose one which was bedded

knee-deep in loose ashes, and ploughed our way with prodigious strides

that would almost have shamed the performance of him of the seven-league

boots.



The Vesuvius of today is a very poor affair compared to the mighty

volcano of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, but I am glad I visited it.

It was well worth it.



It is said that during one of the grand eruptions of Vesuvius it

discharged massy rocks weighing many tons a thousand feet into the air,

its vast jets of smoke and steam ascended thirty miles toward the

firmament, and clouds of its ashes were wafted abroad and fell upon the

decks of ships seven hundred and fifty miles at sea!  I will take the

ashes at a moderate discount, if any one will take the thirty miles of

smoke, but I do not feel able to take a commanding interest in the whole

story by myself.









CHAPTER XXXI.



                        THE BURIED CITY OF POMPEII



They pronounce it Pom-pay-e.  I always had an idea that you went down

into Pompeii with torches, by the way of damp, dark stairways, just as

you do in silver mines, and traversed gloomy tunnels with lava overhead

and something on either hand like dilapidated prisons gouged out of the

solid earth, that faintly resembled houses.  But you do nothing the kind.

Fully one-half of the buried city, perhaps, is completely exhumed and

thrown open freely to the light of day; and there stand the long rows of

solidly-built brick houses (roofless) just as they stood eighteen hundred

years ago, hot with the flaming sun; and there lie their floors, clean-

swept, and not a bright fragment tarnished or waiting of the labored

mosaics that pictured them with the beasts, and birds, and flowers which

we copy in perishable carpets to-day; and here are the Venuses, and

Bacchuses, and Adonises, making love and getting drunk in many-hued

frescoes on the walls of saloon and bed-chamber; and there are the narrow

streets and narrower sidewalks, paved with flags of good hard lava, the

one deeply rutted with the chariot-wheels, and the other with the passing

feet of the Pompeiians of by-gone centuries; and there are the bake-

shops, the temples, the halls of justice, the baths, the theatres--all

clean-scraped and neat, and suggesting nothing of the nature of a silver

mine away down in the bowels of the earth.  The broken pillars lying

about, the doorless doorways and the crumbled tops of the wilderness of

walls, were wonderfully suggestive of the "burnt district" in one of our

cities, and if there had been any charred timbers, shattered windows,

heaps of debris, and general blackness and smokiness about the place, the

resemblance would have been perfect.  But no--the sun shines as brightly

down on old Pompeii to-day as it did when Christ was born in Bethlehem,

and its streets are cleaner a hundred times than ever Pompeiian saw them

in her prime.  I know whereof I speak--for in the great, chief

thoroughfares (Merchant street and the Street of Fortune) have I not seen

with my own eyes how for two hundred years at least the pavements were

not repaired!--how ruts five and even ten inches deep were worn into the

thick flagstones by the chariot-wheels of generations of swindled tax-

payers?  And do I not know by these signs that Street Commissioners of

Pompeii never attended to their business, and that if they never mended

the pavements they never cleaned them?  And, besides, is it not the

inborn nature of Street Commissioners to avoid their duty whenever they

get a chance?  I wish I knew the name of the last one that held office in

Pompeii so that I could give him a blast.  I speak with feeling on this

subject, because I caught my foot in one of those ruts, and the sadness

that came over me when I saw the first poor skeleton, with ashes and lava

sticking to it, was tempered by the reflection that may be that party was

the Street Commissioner.



No--Pompeii is no longer a buried city.  It is a city of hundreds and

hundreds of roofless houses, and a tangled maze of streets where one

could easily get lost, without a guide, and have to sleep in some ghostly

palace that had known no living tenant since that awful November night of

eighteen centuries ago.



We passed through the gate which faces the Mediterranean, (called the

"Marine Gate,") and by the rusty, broken image of Minerva, still keeping

tireless watch and ward over the possessions it was powerless to save,

and went up a long street and stood in the broad court of the Forum of

Justice.  The floor was level and clean, and up and down either side was

a noble colonnade of broken pillars, with their beautiful Ionic and

Corinthian columns scattered about them.  At the upper end were the

vacant seats of the Judges, and behind them we descended into a dungeon

where the ashes and cinders had found two prisoners chained on that

memorable November night, and tortured them to death.  How they must have

tugged at the pitiless fetters as the fierce fires surged around them!



Then we lounged through many and many a sumptuous private mansion which

we could not have entered without a formal invitation in incomprehensible

Latin, in the olden time, when the owners lived there--and we probably

wouldn't have got it.  These people built their houses a good deal alike.

The floors were laid in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics of many-

colored marbles.  At the threshold your eyes fall upon a Latin sentence

of welcome, sometimes, or a picture of a dog, with the legend "Beware of

the Dog," and sometimes a picture of a bear or a faun with no inscription

at all.  Then you enter a sort of vestibule, where they used to keep the

hat-rack, I suppose; next a room with a large marble basin in the midst

and the pipes of a fountain; on either side are bedrooms; beyond the

fountain is a reception-room, then a little garden, dining-room, and so

forth and so on.  The floors were all mosaic, the walls were stuccoed, or

frescoed, or ornamented with bas-reliefs, and here and there were

statues, large and small, and little fish-pools, and cascades of

sparkling water that sprang from secret places in the colonnade of

handsome pillars that surrounded the court, and kept the flower-beds

fresh and the air cool.  Those Pompeiians were very luxurious in their

tastes and habits.  The most exquisite bronzes we have seen in Europe,

came from the exhumed cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and also the

finest cameos and the most delicate engravings on precious stones; their

pictures, eighteen or nineteen centuries old, are often much more

pleasing than the celebrated rubbish of the old masters of three

centuries ago.  They were well up in art.  From the creation of these

works of the first, clear up to the eleventh century, art seems hardly to

have existed at all--at least no remnants of it are left--and it was

curious to see how far (in some things, at any rate,) these old time

pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came after them.

The pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the Laocoon and the Dying

Gladiator, in Rome.  They are as old as Pompeii, were dug from the earth

like Pompeii; but their exact age or who made them can only be

conjectured.  But worn, and cracked, without a history, and with the

blemishing stains of numberless centuries upon them, they still mutely

mock at all efforts to rival their perfections.



It was a quaint and curious pastime, wandering through this old silent

city of the dead--lounging through utterly deserted streets where

thousands and thousands of human beings once bought and sold, and walked

and rode, and made the place resound with the noise and confusion of

traffic and pleasure.  They were not lazy.  They hurried in those days.

We had evidence of that.  There was a temple on one corner, and it was a

shorter cut to go between the columns of that temple from one street to

the other than to go around--and behold that pathway had been worn deep

into the heavy flagstone floor of the building by generations of time-

saving feet!  They would not go around when it was quicker to go through.

We do that way in our cities.



Every where, you see things that make you wonder how old these old houses

were before the night of destruction came--things, too, which bring back

those long dead inhabitants and place the living before your eyes.  For

instance: The steps (two feet thick--lava blocks) that lead up out of the

school, and the same kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle of

the principal theatre, are almost worn through!  For ages the boys

hurried out of that school, and for ages their parents hurried into that

theatre, and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for eighteen

centuries have left their record for us to read to-day.  I imagined I

could see crowds of gentlemen and ladies thronging into the theatre, with

tickets for secured seats in their hands, and on the wall, I read the

imaginary placard, in infamous grammar, "POSITIVELY NO FREE LIST, EXCEPT

MEMBERS OF THE PRESS!"  Hanging about the doorway (I fancied,) were

slouchy Pompeiian street-boys uttering slang and profanity, and keeping a

wary eye out for checks.  I entered the theatre, and sat down in one of

the long rows of stone benches in the dress circle, and looked at the

place for the orchestra, and the ruined stage, and around at the wide

sweep of empty boxes, and thought to myself, "This house won't pay."  I

tried to imagine the music in full blast, the leader of the orchestra

beating time, and the "versatile" So-and-So (who had "just returned from

a most successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewell

engagement of positively six nights only, in Pompeii, previous to his

departure for Herculaneum,") charging around the stage and piling the

agony mountains high--but I could not do it with such a "house" as that;

those empty benches tied my fancy down to dull reality.  I said, these

people that ought to be here have been dead, and still, and moldering to

dust for ages and ages, and will never care for the trifles and follies

of life any more for ever--"Owing to circumstances, etc., etc., there

will not be any performance to-night."  Close down the curtain.  Put out

the lights.



And so I turned away and went through shop after shop and store after

store, far down the long street of the merchants, and called for the

wares of Rome and the East, but the tradesmen were gone, the marts were

silent, and nothing was left but the broken jars all set in cement of

cinders and ashes: the wine and the oil that once had filled them were

gone with their owners.



In a bake-shop was a mill for grinding the grain, and the furnaces for

baking the bread: and they say that here, in the same furnaces, the

exhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had not

found time to remove from the ovens the last time he left his shop,

because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry.



In one house (the only building in Pompeii which no woman is now allowed

to enter,) were the small rooms and short beds of solid masonry, just as

they were in the old times, and on the walls were pictures which looked

almost as fresh as if they were painted yesterday, but which no pen could

have the hardihood to describe; and here and there were Latin

inscriptions--obscene scintillations of wit, scratched by hands that

possibly were uplifted to Heaven for succor in the midst of a driving

storm of fire before the night was done.



In one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank, and a water-

spout that supplied it, and where the tired, heated toilers from the

Campagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put their

lips to the spout, the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove an

inch or two deep.  Think of the countless thousands of hands that had

pressed that spot in the ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone that is

as hard as iron!



They had a great public bulletin board in Pompeii--a place where

announcements for gladiatorial combats, elections, and such things, were

posted--not on perishable paper, but carved in enduring stone.  One lady,

who, I take it, was rich and well brought up, advertised a dwelling or so

to rent, with baths and all the modern improvements, and several hundred

shops, stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoral

purposes.  You can find out who lived in many a house in Pompeii by the

carved stone door-plates affixed to them: and in the same way you can

tell who they were that occupy the tombs.  Every where around are things

that reveal to you something of the customs and history of this forgotten

people.  But what would a volcano leave of an American city, if it once

rained its cinders on it?  Hardly a sign or a symbol to tell its story.



In one of these long Pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was found,

with ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the other.  He had

seized his money and started toward the door, but the fiery tempest

caught him at the very threshold, and he sank down and died.  One more

minute of precious time would have saved him.  I saw the skeletons of a

man, a woman, and two young girls.  The woman had her hands spread wide

apart, as if in mortal terror, and I imagined I could still trace upon

her shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair that

distorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets, so many ages

ago.  The girls and the man lay with their faces upon their arms, as if

they had tried to shield them from the enveloping cinders.  In one

apartment eighteen skeletons were found, all in sitting postures, and

blackened places on the walls still mark their shapes and show their

attitudes, like shadows.  One of them, a woman, still wore upon her

skeleton throat a necklace, with her name engraved upon it--JULIE DI

DIOMEDE.



But perhaps the most poetical thing Pompeii has yielded to modern

research, was that grand figure of a Roman soldier, clad in complete

armor; who, true to his duty, true to his proud name of a soldier of

Rome, and full of the stern courage which had given to that name its

glory, stood to his post by the city gate, erect and unflinching, till

the hell that raged around him burned out the dauntless spirit it could

not conquer.



We never read of Pompeii but we think of that soldier; we can not write

of Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him the mention he so

well deserves.  Let us remember that he was a soldier--not a policeman--

and so, praise him.  Being a soldier, he staid,--because the warrior

instinct forbade him to fly.  Had he been a policeman he would have

staid, also--because he would have been asleep.



There are not half a dozen flights of stairs in Pompeii, and no other

evidences that the houses were more than one story high.  The people did

not live in the clouds, as do the Venetians, the Genoese and Neapolitans

of to-day.



We came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of the Venerable

Past--this city which perished, with all its old ways and its quaint old

fashions about it, remote centuries ago, when the Disciples were

preaching the new religion, which is as old as the hills to us now--and

went dreaming among the trees that grow over acres and acres of its still

buried streets and squares, till a shrill whistle and the cry of "All

aboard--last train for Naples!"  woke me up and reminded me that I

belonged in the nineteenth century, and was not a dusty mummy, caked with

ashes and cinders, eighteen hundred years old.  The transition was

startling.  The idea of a railroad train actually running to old dead

Pompeii, and whistling irreverently, and calling for passengers in the

most bustling and business-like way, was as strange a thing as one could

imagine, and as unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange.



Compare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with the horrors

the younger Pliny saw here, the 9th of November, A.D. 79, when he was so

bravely striving to remove his mother out of reach of harm, while she

begged him, with all a mother's unselfishness, to leave her to perish and

save himself.



     'By this time the murky darkness had so increased that one might

     have believed himself abroad in a black and moonless night, or in a

     chamber where all the lights had been extinguished.  On every hand

     was heard the complaints of women, the wailing of children, and the

     cries of men.  One called his father, another his son, and another

     his wife, and only by their voices could they know each other.  Many

     in their despair begged that death would come and end their

     distress.



     "Some implored the gods to succor them, and some believed that this

     night was the last, the eternal night which should engulf the

     universe!



     "Even so it seemed to me--and I consoled myself for the coming death

     with the reflection: BEHOLD, THE WORLD IS PASSING AWAY!"



                              * * * * * * * *



After browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii, and

after glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless

imperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thing

strikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial, unlasting

character of fame.  Men lived long lives, in the olden time, and

struggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, in

generalship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy in

the possession of an enduring history and a deathless name.  Well, twenty

little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these things?  A crazy

inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy antiquaries bother over and

tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name (which they spell

wrong)--no history, no tradition, no poetry--nothing that can give it

even a passing interest.  What may be left of General Grant's great name

forty centuries hence?  This--in the Encyclopedia for A. D. 5868,

possibly:



     "URIAH S. (or Z.) GRAUNT--popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec

     provinces of the United States of British America.  Some authors say

     flourished about A. D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states

     that he was a cotemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and

     flourished about A. D. 1328, some three centuries after the Trojan

     war instead of before it.  He wrote 'Rock me to Sleep, Mother.'"



These thoughts sadden me.  I will to bed.









CHAPTER XXXII.



Home, again!  For the first time, in many weeks, the ship's entire family

met and shook hands on the quarter-deck.  They had gathered from many

points of the compass and from many lands, but not one was missing; there

was no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasure

of the reunion.  Once more there was a full audience on deck to listen to

the sailors' chorus as they got the anchor up, and to wave an adieu to

the land as we sped away from Naples.  The seats were full at dinner

again, the domino parties were complete, and the life and bustle on the

upper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old times--old times

that had been gone weeks only, but yet they were weeks so crowded with

incident, adventure and excitement, that they seemed almost like years.

There was no lack of cheerfulness on board the Quaker City.  For once,

her title was a misnomer.



At seven in the evening, with the western horizon all golden from the

sunken sun, and specked with distant ships, the full moon sailing high

over head, the dark blue of the sea under foot, and a strange sort of

twilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us and

about us, we sighted superb Stromboli.  With what majesty the monarch

held his lonely state above the level sea!  Distance clothed him in a

purple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his

rugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze.

His torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke that

rose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave

that he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a dead

one.



At two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina, and so

bright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on the

other seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them

from the middle of a street we were traversing.  The city of Messina,

milk-white, and starred and spangled all over with gaslights, was a fairy

spectacle.  A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise,

and waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis.  And presently the Oracle

stepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the deck

like another Colossus of Rhodes.  It was a surprise to see him abroad at

such an hour.  Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like

that of Scylla and Charybdis.  One of the boys said:



"Hello, doctor, what are you doing up here at this time of night?--What

do you want to see this place for?"



"What do I want to see this place for?  Young man, little do you know me,

or you wouldn't ask such a question.  I wish to see all the places that's

mentioned in the Bible."



"Stuff--this place isn't mentioned in the Bible."



"It ain't mentioned in the Bible!--this place ain't--well now, what place

is this, since you know so much about it?"



"Why it's Scylla and Charybdis."



"Scylla and Cha--confound it, I thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah!"



And he closed up his glass and went below.  The above is the ship story.

Its plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the Oracle was not a

biblical student, and did not spend much of his time instructing himself

about Scriptural localities.--They say the Oracle complains, in this hot

weather, lately, that the only beverage in the ship that is passable, is

the butter.  He did not mean butter, of course, but inasmuch as that

article remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice, it is fair

to give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place,

anyhow, for once in his life.  He said, in Rome, that the Pope was a

noble-looking old man, but he never did think much of his Iliad.



We spent one pleasant day skirting along the Isles of Greece.  They are

very mountainous.  Their prevailing tints are gray and brown, approaching

to red.  Little white villages surrounded by trees, nestle in the valleys

or roost upon the lofty perpendicular sea-walls.



We had one fine sunset--a rich carmine flush that suffused the western

sky and cast a ruddy glow far over the sea.--Fine sunsets seem to be

rare in this part of the world--or at least, striking ones.  They are

soft, sensuous, lovely--they are exquisite refined, effeminate, but we

have seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flame

in the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes.



But what were sunsets to us, with the wild excitement upon us of

approaching the most renowned of cities!  What cared we for outward

visions, when Agamemnon, Achilles, and a thousand other heroes of the

great Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies?  What

were sunsets to us, who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual

Athens; yea, and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person

for the slaves, Diogenes and Plato, in the public market-place, or gossip

with the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds of

Marathon?  We scorned to consider sunsets.



We arrived, and entered the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last.  We

dropped anchor within half a mile of the village.  Away off, across the

undulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hill

with a something on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be the

ruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent among

them loomed the venerable Parthenon.  So exquisitely clear and pure is

this wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was

discernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about it

assumed some semblance of shape.  This at a distance of five or six

miles.  In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill before

spoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary

lorgnette.  Every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classic

localities as quickly as possible.  No land we had yet seen had aroused

such universal interest among the passengers.



But bad news came.  The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, and

said we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain

imprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days!  So we

took up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking

in supplies, and then sail for Constantinople.  It was the bitterest

disappointment we had yet experienced.  To lie a whole day in sight of

the Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens!

Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the

circumstances.



All hands were on deck, all the afternoon, with books and maps and

glasses, trying to determine which "narrow rocky ridge" was the

Areopagus, which sloping hill the Pnyx, which elevation the Museum Hill,

and so on.  And we got things confused.  Discussion became heated, and

party spirit ran high.  Church members were gazing with emotion upon a

hill which they said was the one St. Paul preached from, and another

faction claimed that that hill was Hymettus, and another that it was

Pentelicon!  After all the trouble, we could be certain of only one

thing--the square-topped hill was the Acropolis, and the grand ruin that

crowned it was the Parthenon, whose picture we knew in infancy in the

school books.



We inquired of every body who came near the ship, whether there were

guards in the Piraeus, whether they were strict, what the chances were of

capture should any of us slip ashore, and in case any of us made the

venture and were caught, what would be probably done to us?  The answers

were discouraging: There was a strong guard or police force; the Piraeus

was a small town, and any stranger seen in it would surely attract

attention--capture would be certain.  The commandant said the punishment

would be "heavy;" when asked "how heavy?" he said it would be "very

severe"--that was all we could get out of him.



At eleven o'clock at night, when most of the ship's company were abed,

four of us stole softly ashore in a small boat, a clouded moon favoring

the enterprise, and started two and two, and far apart, over a low hill,

intending to go clear around the Piraeus, out of the range of its police.

Picking our way so stealthily over that rocky, nettle-grown eminence,

made me feel a good deal as if I were on my way somewhere to steal

something.  My immediate comrade and I talked in an undertone about

quarantine laws and their penalties, but we found nothing cheering in the

subject.  I was posted.  Only a few days before, I was talking with our

captain, and he mentioned the case of a man who swam ashore from a

quarantined ship somewhere, and got imprisoned six months for it; and

when he was in Genoa a few years ago, a captain of a quarantined ship

went in his boat to a departing ship, which was already outside of the

harbor, and put a letter on board to be taken to his family, and the

authorities imprisoned him three months for it, and then conducted him

and his ship fairly to sea, and warned him never to show himself in that

port again while he lived.  This kind of conversation did no good,

further than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantine-breaking

expedition, and so we dropped it.  We made the entire circuit of the town

without seeing any body but one man, who stared at us curiously, but said

nothing, and a dozen persons asleep on the ground before their doors,

whom we walked among and never woke--but we woke up dogs enough, in all

conscience--we always had one or two barking at our heels, and several

times we had as many as ten and twelve at once.  They made such a

preposterous din that persons aboard our ship said they could tell how we

were progressing for a long time, and where we were, by the barking of

the dogs.  The clouded moon still favored us.  When we had made the whole

circuit, and were passing among the houses on the further side of the

town, the moon came out splendidly, but we no longer feared the light.

As we approached a well, near a house, to get a drink, the owner merely

glanced at us and went within.  He left the quiet, slumbering town at our

mercy.  I record it here proudly, that we didn't do any thing to it.



Seeing no road, we took a tall hill to the left of the distant Acropolis

for a mark, and steered straight for it over all obstructions, and over a

little rougher piece of country than exists any where else outside of the

State of Nevada, perhaps.  Part of the way it was covered with small,

loose stones--we trod on six at a time, and they all rolled.  Another

part of it was dry, loose, newly-ploughed ground.  Still another part of

it was a long stretch of low grape-vines, which were tanglesome and

troublesome, and which we took to be brambles.  The Attic Plain, barring

the grape-vines, was a barren, desolate, unpoetical waste--I wonder what

it was in Greece's Age of Glory, five hundred years before Christ?



In the neighborhood of one o'clock in the morning, when we were heated

with fast walking and parched with thirst, Denny exclaimed, "Why, these

weeds are grape-vines!"  and in five minutes we had a score of bunches of

large, white, delicious grapes, and were reaching down for more when a

dark shape rose mysteriously up out of the shadows beside us and said

"Ho!"  And so we left.



In ten minutes more we struck into a beautiful road, and unlike some

others we had stumbled upon at intervals, it led in the right direction.

We followed it.  It was broad, and smooth, and white--handsome and in

perfect repair, and shaded on both sides for a mile or so with single

ranks of trees, and also with luxuriant vineyards.  Twice we entered and

stole grapes, and the second time somebody shouted at us from some

invisible place.  Whereupon we left again.  We speculated in grapes no

more on that side of Athens.



Shortly we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct, built upon arches, and

from that time forth we had ruins all about us--we were approaching our

journey's end.  We could not see the Acropolis now or the high hill,

either, and I wanted to follow the road till we were abreast of them, but

the others overruled me, and we toiled laboriously up the stony hill

immediately in our front--and from its summit saw another--climbed it and

saw another!  It was an hour of exhausting work.  Soon we came upon a row

of open graves, cut in the solid rock--(for a while one of them served

Socrates for a prison)--we passed around the shoulder of the hill, and

the citadel, in all its ruined magnificence, burst upon us!  We hurried

across the ravine and up a winding road, and stood on the old Acropolis,

with the prodigious walls of the citadel towering above our heads.  We

did not stop to inspect their massive blocks of marble, or measure their

height, or guess at their extraordinary thickness, but passed at once

through a great arched passage like a railway tunnel, and went straight

to the gate that leads to the ancient temples.  It was locked!  So, after

all, it seemed that we were not to see the great Parthenon face to face.

We sat down and held a council of war.  Result: the gate was only a

flimsy structure of wood--we would break it down.  It seemed like

desecration, but then we had traveled far, and our necessities were

urgent.  We could not hunt up guides and keepers--we must be on the ship

before daylight.  So we argued.  This was all very fine, but when we came

to break the gate, we could not do it.  We moved around an angle of the

wall and found a low bastion--eight feet high without--ten or twelve

within.  Denny prepared to scale it, and we got ready to follow.  By dint

of hard scrambling he finally straddled the top, but some loose stones

crumbled away and fell with a crash into the court within.  There was

instantly a banging of doors and a shout.  Denny dropped from the wall in

a twinkling, and we retreated in disorder to the gate.  Xerxes took that

mighty citadel four hundred and eighty years before Christ, when his five

millions of soldiers and camp-followers followed him to Greece, and if we

four Americans could have remained unmolested five minutes longer, we

would have taken it too.



The garrison had turned out--four Greeks.  We clamored at the gate, and

they admitted us.  [Bribery and corruption.]



We crossed a large court, entered a great door, and stood upon a pavement

of purest white marble, deeply worn by footprints.  Before us, in the

flooding moonlight, rose the noblest ruins we had ever looked upon--the

Propylae; a small Temple of Minerva; the Temple of Hercules, and the

grand Parthenon.  [We got these names from the Greek guide, who didn't

seem to know more than seven men ought to know.] These edifices were all

built of the whitest Pentelic marble, but have a pinkish stain upon them

now.  Where any part is broken, however, the fracture looks like fine

loaf sugar.  Six caryatides, or marble women, clad in flowing robes,

support the portico of the Temple of Hercules, but the porticos and

colonnades of the other structures are formed of massive Doric and Ionic

pillars, whose flutings and capitals are still measurably perfect,

notwithstanding the centuries that have gone over them and the sieges

they have suffered.  The Parthenon, originally, was two hundred and

twenty-six feet long, one hundred wide, and seventy high, and had two

rows of great columns, eight in each, at either end, and single rows of

seventeen each down the sides, and was one of the most graceful and

beautiful edifices ever erected.



Most of the Parthenon's imposing columns are still standing, but the roof

is gone.  It was a perfect building two hundred and fifty years ago, when

a shell dropped into the Venetian magazine stored here, and the explosion

which followed wrecked and unroofed it.  I remember but little about the

Parthenon, and I have put in one or two facts and figures for the use of

other people with short memories.  Got them from the guide-book.



As we wandered thoughtfully down the marble-paved length of this stately

temple, the scene about us was strangely impressive.  Here and there, in

lavish profusion, were gleaming white statues of men and women, propped

against blocks of marble, some of them armless, some without legs, others

headless--but all looking mournful in the moonlight, and startlingly

human!  They rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side--

they stared at him with stony eyes from unlooked-for nooks and recesses;

they peered at him over fragmentary heaps far down the desolate

corridors; they barred his way in the midst of the broad forum, and

solemnly pointed with handless arms the way from the sacred fane; and

through the roofless temple the moon looked down, and banded the floor

and darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues with the slanting

shadows of the columns.



What a world of ruined sculpture was about us!  Set up in rows--stacked

up in piles--scattered broadcast over the wide area of the Acropolis--

were hundreds of crippled statues of all sizes and of the most exquisite

workmanship; and vast fragments of marble that once belonged to the

entablatures, covered with bas-reliefs representing battles and sieges,

ships of war with three and four tiers of oars, pageants and processions

--every thing one could think of.  History says that the temples of the

Acropolis were filled with the noblest works of Praxiteles and Phidias,

and of many a great master in sculpture besides--and surely these elegant

fragments attest it.



We walked out into the grass-grown, fragment-strewn court beyond the

Parthenon.  It startled us, every now and then, to see a stony white face

stare suddenly up at us out of the grass with its dead eyes.  The place

seemed alive with ghosts.  I half expected to see the Athenian heroes of

twenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal into the old

temple they knew so well and regarded with such boundless pride.



The full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens, now.  We

sauntered carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the lofty

battlements of the citadel, and looked down--a vision!  And such a

vision!  Athens by moonlight!  The prophet that thought the splendors of

the New Jerusalem were revealed to him, surely saw this instead!  It lay

in the level plain right under our feet--all spread abroad like a

picture--and we looked down upon it as we might have looked from a

balloon.  We saw no semblance of a street, but every house, every window,

every clinging vine, every projection was as distinct and sharply marked

as if the time were noon-day; and yet there was no glare, no glitter,

nothing harsh or repulsive--the noiseless city was flooded with the

mellowest light that ever streamed from the moon, and seemed like some

living creature wrapped in peaceful slumber.  On its further side was a

little temple, whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich

lustre that chained the eye like a spell; and nearer by, the palace of

the king reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of

shrubbery that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights

--a spray of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the

moon, and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid

stars of the milky-way.  Overhead the stately columns, majestic still in

their ruin--under foot the dreaming city--in the distance the silver sea

--not on the broad earth is there an other picture half so beautiful!



As we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that the

illustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it again

and reveal themselves to our curious eyes--Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,

Socrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon, Herodotus,

Praxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter.  What a constellation of

celebrated names!  But more than all, I wished that old Diogenes, groping

so patiently with his lantern, searching so zealously for one solitary

honest man in all the world, might meander along and stumble on our

party.  I ought not to say it, may be, but still I suppose he would have

put out his light.



We left the Parthenon to keep its watch over old Athens, as it had kept

it for twenty-three hundred years, and went and stood outside the walls

of the citadel.  In the distance was the ancient, but still almost

perfect Temple of Theseus, and close by, looking to the west, was the

Bema, from whence Demosthenes thundered his philippics and fired the

wavering patriotism of his countrymen.  To the right was Mars Hill, where

the Areopagus sat in ancient times and where St. Paul defined his

position, and below was the market-place where he "disputed daily" with

the gossip-loving Athenians.  We climbed the stone steps St. Paul

ascended, and stood in the square-cut place he stood in, and tried to

recollect the Bible account of the matter--but for certain reasons, I

could not recall the words.  I have found them since:



     "Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in

     him, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry.  "Therefore

     disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout

     persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.

                         * * * * * * * * *

     "And they took him and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we

     know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is?

                         * * * * * * * * *

     "Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said, Ye men of

     Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious; "For

     as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this

     inscription: To THE UNKNOWN GOD.  Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly

     worship, him declare I unto you."--Acts, ch. xvii."



It occurred to us, after a while, that if we wanted to get home before

daylight betrayed us, we had better be moving.  So we hurried away.  When

far on our road, we had a parting view of the Parthenon, with the

moonlight streaming through its open colonnades and touching its capitals

with silver.  As it looked then, solemn, grand, and beautiful it will

always remain in our memories.



As we marched along, we began to get over our fears, and ceased to care

much about quarantine scouts or any body else.  We grew bold and

reckless; and once, in a sudden burst of courage, I even threw a stone at

a dog.  It was a pleasant reflection, though, that I did not hit him,

because his master might just possibly have been a policeman.  Inspired

by this happy failure, my valor became utterly uncontrollable, and at

intervals I absolutely whistled, though on a moderate key.  But boldness

breeds boldness, and shortly I plunged into a Vineyard, in the full light

of the moon, and captured a gallon of superb grapes, not even minding the

presence of a peasant who rode by on a mule.  Denny and Birch followed my

example.



Now I had grapes enough for a dozen, but then Jackson was all swollen up

with courage, too, and he was obliged to enter a vineyard presently.  The

first bunch he seized brought trouble.  A frowsy, bearded brigand sprang

into the road with a shout, and flourished a musket in the light of the

moon!  We sidled toward the Piraeus--not running you understand, but only

advancing with celerity.  The brigand shouted again, but still we

advanced.  It was getting late, and we had no time to fool away on every

ass that wanted to drivel Greek platitudes to us.  We would just as soon

have talked with him as not if we had not been in a hurry.  Presently

Denny said, "Those fellows are following us!"



We turned, and, sure enough, there they were--three fantastic pirates

armed with guns.  We slackened our pace to let them come up, and in the

meantime I got out my cargo of grapes and dropped them firmly but

reluctantly into the shadows by the wayside.  But I was not afraid.  I

only felt that it was not right to steal grapes.  And all the more so

when the owner was around--and not only around, but with his friends

around also.  The villains came up and searched a bundle Dr. Birch had in

his hand, and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it but

some holy rocks from Mars Hill, and these were not contraband.  They

evidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them, and

seemed half inclined to scalp the party.  But finally they dismissed us

with a warning, couched in excellent Greek, I suppose, and dropped

tranquilly in our wake.  When they had gone three hundred yards they

stopped, and we went on rejoiced.  But behold, another armed rascal came

out of the shadows and took their place, and followed us two hundred

yards.  Then he delivered us over to another miscreant, who emerged from

some mysterious place, and he in turn to another!  For a mile and a half

our rear was guarded all the while by armed men.  I never traveled in so

much state before in all my life.



It was a good while after that before we ventured to steal any more

grapes, and when we did we stirred up another troublesome brigand, and

then we ceased all further speculation in that line.  I suppose that

fellow that rode by on the mule posted all the sentinels, from Athens to

the Piraeus, about us.



Every field on that long route was watched by an armed sentinel, some of

whom had fallen asleep, no doubt, but were on hand, nevertheless.  This

shows what sort of a country modern Attica is--a community of

questionable characters.  These men were not there to guard their

possessions against strangers, but against each other; for strangers

seldom visit Athens and the Piraeus, and when they do, they go in

daylight, and can buy all the grapes they want for a trifle.  The modern

inhabitants are confiscators and falsifiers of high repute, if gossip

speaks truly concerning them, and I freely believe it does.



Just as the earliest tinges of the dawn flushed the eastern sky and

turned the pillared Parthenon to a broken harp hung in the pearly

horizon, we closed our thirteenth mile of weary, round-about marching,

and emerged upon the sea-shore abreast the ships, with our usual escort

of fifteen hundred Piraean dogs howling at our heels.  We hailed a boat

that was two or three hundred yards from shore, and discovered in a

moment that it was a police-boat on the lookout for any quarantine-

breakers that might chance to be abroad.  So we dodged--we were used to

that by this time--and when the scouts reached the spot we had so lately

occupied, we were absent.  They cruised along the shore, but in the wrong

direction, and shortly our own boat issued from the gloom and took us

aboard.  They had heard our signal on the ship.  We rowed noiselessly

away, and before the police-boat came in sight again, we were safe at

home once more.



Four more of our passengers were anxious to visit Athens, and started

half an hour after we returned; but they had not been ashore five minutes

till the police discovered and chased them so hotly that they barely

escaped to their boat again, and that was all.  They pursued the

enterprise no further.



We set sail for Constantinople to-day, but some of us little care for

that.  We have seen all there was to see in the old city that had its

birth sixteen hundred years before Christ was born, and was an old town

before the foundations of Troy were laid--and saw it in its most

attractive aspect.  Wherefore, why should we worry?



Two other passengers ran the blockade successfully last night.  So we

learned this morning.  They slipped away so quietly that they were not

missed from the ship for several hours.  They had the hardihood to march

into the Piraeus in the early dusk and hire a carriage.  They ran some

danger of adding two or three months' imprisonment to the other novelties

of their Holy Land Pleasure Excursion.  I admire "cheek."--[Quotation

from the Pilgrims.]--But they went and came safely, and never walked a

step.









CHAPTER XXXIII.



From Athens all through the islands of the Grecian Archipelago, we saw

little but forbidding sea-walls and barren hills, sometimes surmounted by

three or four graceful columns of some ancient temple, lonely and

deserted--a fitting symbol of the desolation that has come upon all

Greece in these latter ages.  We saw no ploughed fields, very few

villages, no trees or grass or vegetation of any kind, scarcely, and

hardly ever an isolated house.  Greece is a bleak, unsmiling desert,

without agriculture, manufactures or commerce, apparently.  What supports

its poverty-stricken people or its Government, is a mystery.



I suppose that ancient Greece and modern Greece compared, furnish the

most extravagant contrast to be found in history.  George I., an infant

of eighteen, and a scraggy nest of foreign office holders, sit in the

places of Themistocles, Pericles, and the illustrious scholars and

generals of the Golden Age of Greece.  The fleets that were the wonder of

the world when the Parthenon was new, are a beggarly handful of fishing-

smacks now, and the manly people that performed such miracles of valor at

Marathon are only a tribe of unconsidered slaves to-day.  The classic

Illyssus has gone dry, and so have all the sources of Grecian wealth and

greatness.  The nation numbers only eight hundred thousand souls, and

there is poverty and misery and mendacity enough among them to furnish

forty millions and be liberal about it.  Under King Otho the revenues of

the State were five millions of dollars--raised from a tax of one-tenth

of all the agricultural products of the land (which tenth the farmer had

to bring to the royal granaries on pack-mules any distance not exceeding

six leagues) and from extravagant taxes on trade and commerce.  Out of

that five millions the small tyrant tried to keep an army of ten thousand

men, pay all the hundreds of useless Grand Equerries in Waiting, First

Grooms of the Bedchamber, Lord High Chancellors of the Exploded

Exchequer, and all the other absurdities which these puppy-kingdoms

indulge in, in imitation of the great monarchies; and in addition he set

about building a white marble palace to cost about five millions itself.

The result was, simply: ten into five goes no times and none over.  All

these things could not be done with five millions, and Otho fell into

trouble.



The Greek throne, with its unpromising adjuncts of a ragged population of

ingenious rascals who were out of employment eight months in the year

because there was little for them to borrow and less to confiscate, and a

waste of barren hills and weed-grown deserts, went begging for a good

while.  It was offered to one of Victoria's sons, and afterwards to

various other younger sons of royalty who had no thrones and were out of

business, but they all had the charity to decline the dreary honor, and

veneration enough for Greece's ancient greatness to refuse to mock her

sorrowful rags and dirt with a tinsel throne in this day of her

humiliation--till they came to this young Danish George, and he took it.

He has finished the splendid palace I saw in the radiant moonlight the

other night, and is doing many other things for the salvation of Greece,

they say.



We sailed through the barren Archipelago, and into the narrow channel

they sometimes call the Dardanelles and sometimes the Hellespont.  This

part of the country is rich in historic reminiscences, and poor as Sahara

in every thing else.  For instance, as we approached the Dardanelles, we

coasted along the Plains of Troy and past the mouth of the Scamander; we

saw where Troy had stood (in the distance,) and where it does not stand

now--a city that perished when the world was young.  The poor Trojans are

all dead, now.  They were born too late to see Noah's ark, and died too

soon to see our menagerie.  We saw where Agamemnon's fleets rendezvoused,

and away inland a mountain which the map said was Mount Ida.  Within the

Hellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract mentioned in

history was carried out, and the "parties of the second part" gently

rebuked by Xerxes.  I speak of the famous bridge of boats which Xerxes

ordered to be built over the narrowest part of the Hellespont (where it

is only two or three miles wide.) A moderate gale destroyed the flimsy

structure, and the King, thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractors

might have a good effect on the next set, called them out before the army

and had them beheaded.  In the next ten minutes he let a new contract for

the bridge.  It has been observed by ancient writers that the second

bridge was a very good bridge.  Xerxes crossed his host of five millions

of men on it, and if it had not been purposely destroyed, it would

probably have been there yet.  If our Government would rebuke some of our

shoddy contractors occasionally, it might work much good.  In the

Hellespont we saw where Leander and Lord Byron swam across, the one to

see her upon whom his soul's affections were fixed with a devotion that

only death could impair, and the other merely for a flyer, as Jack says.

We had two noted tombs near us, too.  On one shore slept Ajax, and on the

other Hecuba.



We had water batteries and forts on both sides of the Hellespont, flying

the crimson flag of Turkey, with its white crescent, and occasionally a

village, and sometimes a train of camels; we had all these to look at

till we entered the broad sea of Marmora, and then the land soon fading

from view, we resumed euchre and whist once more.



We dropped anchor in the mouth of the Golden Horn at daylight in the

morning.  Only three or four of us were up to see the great Ottoman

capital.  The passengers do not turn out at unseasonable hours, as they

used to, to get the earliest possible glimpse of strange foreign cities.

They are well over that.  If we were lying in sight of the Pyramids of

Egypt, they would not come on deck until after breakfast, now-a-days.



The Golden Horn is a narrow arm of the sea, which branches from the

Bosporus (a sort of broad river which connects the Marmora and Black

Seas,) and, curving around, divides the city in the middle.  Galata and

Pera are on one side of the Bosporus, and the Golden Horn; Stamboul

(ancient Byzantium) is upon the other.  On the other bank of the Bosporus

is Scutari and other suburbs of Constantinople.  This great city contains

a million inhabitants, but so narrow are its streets, and so crowded

together are its houses, that it does not cover much more than half as

much ground as New York City.  Seen from the anchorage or from a mile or

so up the Bosporus, it is by far the handsomest city we have seen.  Its

dense array of houses swells upward from the water's edge, and spreads

over the domes of many hills; and the gardens that peep out here and

there, the great globes of the mosques, and the countless minarets that

meet the eye every where, invest the metropolis with the quaint Oriental

aspect one dreams of when he reads books of eastern travel.

Constantinople makes a noble picture.



But its attractiveness begins and ends with its picturesqueness.  From

the time one starts ashore till he gets back again, he execrates it.  The

boat he goes in is admirably miscalculated for the service it is built

for.  It is handsomely and neatly fitted up, but no man could handle it

well in the turbulent currents that sweep down the Bosporus from the

Black Sea, and few men could row it satisfactorily even in still water.

It is a long, light canoe (caique,) large at one end and tapering to a

knife blade at the other.  They make that long sharp end the bow, and you

can imagine how these boiling currents spin it about.  It has two oars,

and sometimes four, and no rudder.  You start to go to a given point and

you run in fifty different directions before you get there.  First one

oar is backing water, and then the other; it is seldom that both are

going ahead at once.  This kind of boating is calculated to drive an

impatient man mad in a week.  The boatmen are the awkwardest, the

stupidest, and the most unscientific on earth, without question.



Ashore, it was--well, it was an eternal circus.  People were thicker than

bees, in those narrow streets, and the men were dressed in all the

outrageous, outlandish, idolatrous, extravagant, thunder-and-lightning

costumes that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven devils

could conceive of.  There was no freak in dress too crazy to be indulged

in; no absurdity too absurd to be tolerated; no frenzy in ragged

diabolism too fantastic to be attempted.  No two men were dressed alike.

It was a wild masquerade of all imaginable costumes--every struggling

throng in every street was a dissolving view of stunning contrasts.  Some

patriarchs wore awful turbans, but the grand mass of the infidel horde

wore the fiery red skull-cap they call a fez.  All the remainder of the

raiment they indulged in was utterly indescribable.



The shops here are mere coops, mere boxes, bath-rooms, closets--any thing

you please to call them--on the first floor.  The Turks sit cross-legged

in them, and work and trade and smoke long pipes, and smell like--like

Turks.  That covers the ground.  Crowding the narrow streets in front of

them are beggars, who beg forever, yet never collect any thing; and

wonderful cripples, distorted out of all semblance of humanity, almost;

vagabonds driving laden asses; porters carrying dry-goods boxes as large

as cottages on their backs; peddlers of grapes, hot corn, pumpkin seeds,

and a hundred other things, yelling like fiends; and sleeping happily,

comfortably, serenely, among the hurrying feet, are the famed dogs of

Constantinople; drifting noiselessly about are squads of Turkish women,

draped from chin to feet in flowing robes, and with snowy veils bound

about their heads, that disclose only the eyes and a vague, shadowy

notion of their features.  Seen moving about, far away in the dim, arched

aisles of the Great Bazaar, they look as the shrouded dead must have

looked when they walked forth from their graves amid the storms and

thunders and earthquakes that burst upon Calvary that awful night of the

Crucifixion.  A street in Constantinople is a picture which one ought to

see once--not oftener.



And then there was the goose-rancher--a fellow who drove a hundred geese

before him about the city, and tried to sell them.  He had a pole ten

feet long, with a crook in the end of it, and occasionally a goose would

branch out from the flock and make a lively break around the corner, with

wings half lifted and neck stretched to its utmost.  Did the goose-

merchant get excited?  No.  He took his pole and reached after that goose

with unspeakable sang froid--took a hitch round his neck, and "yanked"

him back to his place in the flock without an effort.  He steered his

geese with that stick as easily as another man would steer a yawl.  A few

hours afterward we saw him sitting on a stone at a corner, in the midst

of the turmoil, sound asleep in the sun, with his geese squatting around

him, or dodging out of the way of asses and men.  We came by again,

within the hour, and he was taking account of stock, to see whether any

of his flock had strayed or been stolen.  The way he did it was unique.

He put the end of his stick within six or eight inches of a stone wall,

and made the geese march in single file between it and the wall.  He

counted them as they went by.  There was no dodging that arrangement.



If you want dwarfs--I mean just a few dwarfs for a curiosity--go to

Genoa.  If you wish to buy them by the gross, for retail, go to Milan.

There are plenty of dwarfs all over Italy, but it did seem to me that in

Milan the crop was luxuriant.  If you would see a fair average style of

assorted cripples, go to Naples, or travel through the Roman States.

But if you would see the very heart and home of cripples and human

monsters, both, go straight to Constantinople.  A beggar in Naples who

can show a foot which has all run into one horrible toe, with one

shapeless nail on it, has a fortune--but such an exhibition as that would

not provoke any notice in Constantinople.  The man would starve.  Who

would pay any attention to attractions like his among the rare monsters

that throng the bridges of the Golden Horn and display their deformities

in the gutters of Stamboul?  O, wretched impostor!  How could he stand

against the three-legged woman, and the man with his eye in his cheek?

How would he blush in presence of the man with fingers on his elbow?

Where would he hide himself when the dwarf with seven fingers on each

hand, no upper lip, and his under-jaw gone, came down in his majesty?

Bismillah!  The cripples of Europe are a delusion and a fraud.  The truly

gifted flourish only in the by-ways of Pera and Stamboul.



That three-legged woman lay on the bridge, with her stock in trade so

disposed as to command the most striking effect--one natural leg, and two

long, slender, twisted ones with feet on them like somebody else's fore-

arm.  Then there was a man further along who had no eyes, and whose face

was the color of a fly-blown beefsteak, and wrinkled and twisted like a

lava-flow--and verily so tumbled and distorted were his features that no

man could tell the wart that served him for a nose from his cheek-bones.

In Stamboul was a man with a prodigious head, an uncommonly long body,

legs eight inches long and feet like snow-shoes.  He traveled on those

feet and his hands, and was as sway-backed as if the Colossus of Rhodes

had been riding him.  Ah, a beggar has to have exceedingly good points to

make a living in Constantinople.  A blue-faced man, who had nothing to

offer except that he had been blown up in a mine, would be regarded as a

rank impostor, and a mere damaged soldier on crutches would never make a

cent.  It would pay him to get apiece of his head taken off, and

cultivate a wen like a carpet sack.



The Mosque of St. Sophia is the chief lion of Constantinople.  You must

get a firman and hurry there the first thing.  We did that.  We did not

get a firman, but we took along four or five francs apiece, which is much

the same thing.



I do not think much of the Mosque of St. Sophia.  I suppose I lack

appreciation.  We will let it go at that.  It is the rustiest old barn in

heathendom.  I believe all the interest that attaches to it comes from

the fact that it was built for a Christian church and then turned into a

mosque, without much alteration, by the Mohammedan conquerors of the

land.  They made me take off my boots and walk into the place in my

stocking-feet.  I caught cold, and got myself so stuck up with a

complication of gums, slime and general corruption, that I wore out more

than two thousand pair of boot-jacks getting my boots off that night, and

even then some Christian hide peeled off with them.  I abate not a single

boot-jack.



St. Sophia is a colossal church, thirteen or fourteen hundred years old,

and unsightly enough to be very, very much older.  Its immense dome is

said to be more wonderful than St. Peter's, but its dirt is much more

wonderful than its dome, though they never mention it.  The church has a

hundred and seventy pillars in it, each a single piece, and all of costly

marbles of various kinds, but they came from ancient temples at Baalbec,

Heliopolis, Athens and Ephesus, and are battered, ugly and repulsive.

They were a thousand years old when this church was new, and then the

contrast must have been ghastly--if Justinian's architects did not trim

them any.  The inside of the dome is figured all over with a monstrous

inscription in Turkish characters, wrought in gold mosaic, that looks as

glaring as a circus bill; the pavements and the marble balustrades are

all battered and dirty; the perspective is marred every where by a web of

ropes that depend from the dizzy height of the dome, and suspend

countless dingy, coarse oil lamps, and ostrich-eggs, six or seven feet

above the floor.  Squatting and sitting in groups, here and there and far

and near, were ragged Turks reading books, hearing sermons, or receiving

lessons like children.  and in fifty places were more of the same sort

bowing and straightening up, bowing again and getting down to kiss the

earth, muttering prayers the while, and keeping up their gymnastics till

they ought to have been tired, if they were not.



Every where was dirt, and dust, and dinginess, and gloom; every where

were signs of a hoary antiquity, but with nothing touching or beautiful

about it; every where were those groups of fantastic pagans; overhead the

gaudy mosaics and the web of lamp-ropes--nowhere was there any thing to

win one's love or challenge his admiration.



The people who go into ecstasies over St. Sophia must surely get them out

of the guide-book (where every church is spoken of as being "considered

by good judges to be the most marvelous structure, in many respects, that

the world has ever seen.")  Or else they are those old connoisseurs from

the wilds of New Jersey who laboriously learn the difference between a

fresco and a fire-plug and from that day forward feel privileged to void

their critical bathos on painting, sculpture and architecture forever

more.



We visited the Dancing Dervishes.  There were twenty-one of them.  They

wore a long, light-colored loose robe that hung to their heels.  Each in

his turn went up to the priest (they were all within a large circular

railing) and bowed profoundly and then went spinning away deliriously and

took his appointed place in the circle, and continued to spin.  When all

had spun themselves to their places, they were about five or six feet

apart--and so situated, the entire circle of spinning pagans spun itself

three separate times around the room.  It took twenty-five minutes to do

it.  They spun on the left foot, and kept themselves going by passing the

right rapidly before it and digging it against the waxed floor.  Some of

them made incredible "time."  Most of them spun around forty times in a

minute, and one artist averaged about sixty-one times a minute, and kept

it up during the whole twenty-five.  His robe filled with air and stood

out all around him like a balloon.



They made no noise of any kind, and most of them tilted their heads back

and closed their eyes, entranced with a sort of devotional ecstacy.

There was a rude kind of music, part of the time, but the musicians were

not visible.  None but spinners were allowed within the circle.  A man

had to either spin or stay outside.  It was about as barbarous an

exhibition as we have witnessed yet.  Then sick persons came and lay

down, and beside them women laid their sick children (one a babe at the

breast,) and the patriarch of the Dervishes walked upon their bodies.  He

was supposed to cure their diseases by trampling upon their breasts or

backs or standing on the back of their necks.  This is well enough for a

people who think all their affairs are made or marred by viewless spirits

of the air--by giants, gnomes, and genii--and who still believe, to this

day, all the wild tales in the Arabian Nights.  Even so an intelligent

missionary tells me.



We visited the Thousand and One Columns.  I do not know what it was

originally intended for, but they said it was built for a reservoir.  It

is situated in the centre of Constantinople.  You go down a flight of

stone steps in the middle of a barren place, and there you are.  You are

forty feet under ground, and in the midst of a perfect wilderness of

tall, slender, granite columns, of Byzantine architecture.  Stand where

you would, or change your position as often as you pleased, you were

always a centre from which radiated a dozen long archways and colonnades

that lost themselves in distance and the sombre twilight of the place.

This old dried-up reservoir is occupied by a few ghostly silk-spinners

now, and one of them showed me a cross cut high up in one of the pillars.

I suppose he meant me to understand that the institution was there before

the Turkish occupation, and I thought he made a remark to that effect;

but he must have had an impediment in his speech, for I did not

understand him.



We took off our shoes and went into the marble mausoleum of the Sultan

Mahmoud, the neatest piece of architecture, inside, that I have seen

lately.  Mahmoud's tomb was covered with a black velvet pall, which was

elaborately embroidered with silver; it stood within a fancy silver

railing; at the sides and corners were silver candlesticks that would

weigh more than a hundred pounds, and they supported candles as large as

a man's leg; on the top of the sarcophagus was a fez, with a handsome

diamond ornament upon it, which an attendant said cost a hundred thousand

pounds, and lied like a Turk when he said it.  Mahmoud's whole family

were comfortably planted around him.



We went to the great Bazaar in Stamboul, of course, and I shall not

describe it further than to say it is a monstrous hive of little shops--

thousands, I should say--all under one roof, and cut up into innumerable

little blocks by narrow streets which are arched overhead.  One street is

devoted to a particular kind of merchandise, another to another, and so

on.



When you wish to buy a pair of shoes you have the swing of the whole

street--you do not have to walk yourself down hunting stores in different

localities.  It is the same with silks, antiquities, shawls, etc.  The

place is crowded with people all the time, and as the gay-colored Eastern

fabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop, the great Bazaar of

Stamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing.  It is full of life,

and stir, and business, dirt, beggars, asses, yelling peddlers, porters,

dervishes, high-born Turkish female shoppers, Greeks, and weird-looking

and weirdly dressed Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces

--and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the Great

Bazaar, is something which smells good.









CHAPTER XXXIV.



Mosques are plenty, churches are plenty, graveyards are plenty, but

morals and whiskey are scarce.  The Koran does not permit Mohammedans to

drink.  Their natural instincts do not permit them to be moral.  They say

the Sultan has eight hundred wives.  This almost amounts to bigamy.  It

makes our cheeks burn with shame to see such a thing permitted here in

Turkey.  We do not mind it so much in Salt Lake, however.



Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in Constantinople by their

parents, but not publicly.  The great slave marts we have all read so

much about--where tender young girls were stripped for inspection, and

criticised and discussed just as if they were horses at an agricultural

fair--no longer exist.  The exhibition and the sales are private now.

Stocks are up, just at present, partly because of a brisk demand created

by the recent return of the Sultan's suite from the courts of Europe;

partly on account of an unusual abundance of bread-stuffs, which leaves

holders untortured by hunger and enables them to hold back for high

prices; and partly because buyers are too weak to bear the market, while

sellers are amply prepared to bull it.  Under these circumstances, if the

American metropolitan newspapers were published here in Constantinople,

their next commercial report would read about as follows, I suppose:



                        SLAVE GIRL MARKET REPORT.



     "Best brands Circassians, crop of 1850, L200; 1852, L250; 1854,

     L300.  Best brands Georgian, none in market; second quality, 1851,

     L180.  Nineteen fair to middling Wallachian girls offered at L130 @

     150, but no takers; sixteen prime A 1 sold in small lots to close

     out--terms private.



     "Sales of one lot Circassians, prime to good, 1852 to 1854, at L240

     @ 242, buyer 30; one forty-niner--damaged--at L23, seller ten, no

     deposit.  Several Georgians, fancy brands, 1852, changed hands to

     fill orders.  The Georgians now on hand are mostly last year's crop,

     which was unusually poor.  The new crop is a little backward, but

     will be coming in shortly.  As regards its quantity and quality, the

     accounts are most encouraging.  In this connection we can safely

     say, also, that the new crop of Circassians is looking extremely

     well.  His Majesty the Sultan has already sent in large orders for

     his new harem, which will be finished within a fortnight, and this

     has naturally strengthened the market and given Circassian stock a

     strong upward tendency.  Taking advantage of the inflated market,

     many of our shrewdest operators are selling short.  There are hints

     of a "corner" on Wallachians.



     "There is nothing new in Nubians.  Slow sale.



     "Eunuchs--None offering; however, large cargoes are expected from

     Egypt today."





I think the above would be about the style of the commercial report.

Prices are pretty high now, and holders firm; but, two or three years

ago, parents in a starving condition brought their young daughters down

here and sold them for even twenty and thirty dollars, when they could do

no better, simply to save themselves and the girls from dying of want.

It is sad to think of so distressing a thing as this, and I for one am

sincerely glad the prices are up again.



Commercial morals, especially, are bad.  There is no gainsaying that.

Greek, Turkish and Armenian morals consist only in attending church

regularly on the appointed Sabbaths, and in breaking the ten commandments

all the balance of the week.  It comes natural to them to lie and cheat

in the first place, and then they go on and improve on nature until they

arrive at perfection.  In recommending his son to a merchant as a

valuable salesman, a father does not say he is a nice, moral, upright

boy, and goes to Sunday School and is honest, but he says, "This boy is

worth his weight in broad pieces of a hundred--for behold, he will cheat

whomsoever hath dealings with him, and from the Euxine to the waters of

Marmora there abideth not so gifted a liar!"  How is that for a

recommendation?  The Missionaries tell me that they hear encomiums like

that passed upon people every day.  They say of a person they admire,

"Ah, he is a charming swindler, and a most exquisite liar!"



Every body lies and cheats--every body who is in business, at any rate.

Even foreigners soon have to come down to the custom of the country, and

they do not buy and sell long in Constantinople till they lie and cheat

like a Greek.  I say like a Greek, because the Greeks are called the

worst transgressors in this line.  Several Americans long resident in

Constantinople contend that most Turks are pretty trustworthy, but few

claim that the Greeks have any virtues that a man can discover--at least

without a fire assay.



I am half willing to believe that the celebrated dogs of Constantinople

have been misrepresented--slandered.  I have always been led to suppose

that they were so thick in the streets that they blocked the way; that

they moved about in organized companies, platoons and regiments, and took

what they wanted by determined and ferocious assault; and that at night

they drowned all other sounds with their terrible howlings.  The dogs I

see here can not be those I have read of.



I find them every where, but not in strong force.  The most I have found

together has been about ten or twenty.  And night or day a fair

proportion of them were sound asleep.  Those that were not asleep always

looked as if they wanted to be.  I never saw such utterly wretched,

starving, sad-visaged, broken-hearted looking curs in my life.  It seemed

a grim satire to accuse such brutes as these of taking things by force of

arms.  They hardly seemed to have strength enough or ambition enough to

walk across the street--I do not know that I have seen one walk that far

yet.  They are mangy and bruised and mutilated, and often you see one

with the hair singed off him in such wide and well defined tracts that he

looks like a map of the new Territories.  They are the sorriest beasts

that breathe--the most abject--the most pitiful.  In their faces is a

settled expression of melancholy, an air of hopeless despondency.  The

hairless patches on a scalded dog are preferred by the fleas of

Constantinople to a wider range on a healthier dog; and the exposed

places suit the fleas exactly.  I saw a dog of this kind start to nibble

at a flea--a fly attracted his attention, and he made a snatch at him;

the flea called for him once more, and that forever unsettled him; he

looked sadly at his flea-pasture, then sadly looked at his bald spot.

Then he heaved a sigh and dropped his head resignedly upon his paws.  He

was not equal to the situation.



The dogs sleep in the streets, all over the city.  From one end of the

street to the other, I suppose they will average about eight or ten to a

block.  Sometimes, of course, there are fifteen or twenty to a block.

They do not belong to any body, and they seem to have no close personal

friendships among each other.  But they district the city themselves, and

the dogs of each district, whether it be half a block in extent, or ten

blocks, have to remain within its bounds.  Woe to a dog if he crosses the

line!  His neighbors would snatch the balance of his hair off in a

second.  So it is said.  But they don't look it.



They sleep in the streets these days.  They are my compass--my guide.

When I see the dogs sleep placidly on, while men, sheep, geese, and all

moving things turn out and go around them, I know I am not in the great

street where the hotel is, and must go further.  In the Grand Rue the

dogs have a sort of air of being on the lookout--an air born of being

obliged to get out of the way of many carriages every day--and that

expression one recognizes in a moment.  It does not exist upon the face

of any dog without the confines of that street.  All others sleep

placidly and keep no watch.  They would not move, though the Sultan

himself passed by.



In one narrow street (but none of them are wide) I saw three dogs lying

coiled up, about a foot or two apart.  End to end they lay, and so they

just bridged the street neatly, from gutter to gutter.  A drove of a

hundred sheep came along.  They stepped right over the dogs, the rear

crowding the front, impatient to get on.  The dogs looked lazily up,

flinched a little when the impatient feet of the sheep touched their raw

backs--sighed, and lay peacefully down again.  No talk could be plainer

than that.  So some of the sheep jumped over them and others scrambled

between, occasionally chipping a leg with their sharp hoofs, and when the

whole flock had made the trip, the dogs sneezed a little, in the cloud of

dust, but never budged their bodies an inch.  I thought I was lazy, but I

am a steam-engine compared to a Constantinople dog.  But was not that a

singular scene for a city of a million inhabitants?



These dogs are the scavengers of the city.  That is their official

position, and a hard one it is.  However, it is their protection.  But

for their usefulness in partially cleansing these terrible streets, they

would not be tolerated long.  They eat any thing and every thing that

comes in their way, from melon rinds and spoiled grapes up through all

the grades and species of dirt and refuse to their own dead friends and

relatives--and yet they are always lean, always hungry, always

despondent.  The people are loath to kill them--do not kill them, in

fact.  The Turks have an innate antipathy to taking the life of any dumb

animal, it is said.  But they do worse.  They hang and kick and stone and

scald these wretched creatures to the very verge of death, and then leave

them to live and suffer.



Once a Sultan proposed to kill off all the dogs here, and did begin the

work--but the populace raised such a howl of horror about it that the

massacre was stayed.  After a while, he proposed to remove them all to an

island in the Sea of Marmora.  No objection was offered, and a ship-load

or so was taken away.  But when it came to be known that somehow or other

the dogs never got to the island, but always fell overboard in the night

and perished, another howl was raised and the transportation scheme was

dropped.



So the dogs remain in peaceable possession of the streets.  I do not say

that they do not howl at night, nor that they do not attack people who

have not a red fez on their heads.  I only say that it would be mean for

me to accuse them of these unseemly things who have not seen them do them

with my own eyes or heard them with my own ears.



I was a little surprised to see Turks and Greeks playing newsboy right

here in the mysterious land where the giants and genii of the Arabian

Nights once dwelt--where winged horses and hydra-headed dragons guarded

enchanted castles--where Princes and Princesses flew through the air on

carpets that obeyed a mystic talisman--where cities whose houses were

made of precious stones sprang up in a night under the hand of the

magician, and where busy marts were suddenly stricken with a spell and

each citizen lay or sat, or stood with weapon raised or foot advanced,

just as he was, speechless and motionless, till time had told a hundred

years!



It was curious to see newsboys selling papers in so dreamy a land as

that.  And, to say truly, it is comparatively a new thing here.  The

selling of newspapers had its birth in Constantinople about a year ago,

and was a child of the Prussian and Austrian war.



There is one paper published here in the English language--The Levant

Herald--and there are generally a number of Greek and a few French papers

rising and falling, struggling up and falling again.  Newspapers are not

popular with the Sultan's Government.  They do not understand journalism.

The proverb says, "The unknown is always great."  To the court, the

newspaper is a mysterious and rascally institution.  They know what a

pestilence is, because they have one occasionally that thins the people

out at the rate of two thousand a day, and they regard a newspaper as a

mild form of pestilence.  When it goes astray, they suppress it--pounce

upon it without warning, and throttle it.  When it don't go astray for a

long time, they get suspicious and throttle it anyhow, because they think

it is hatching deviltry.  Imagine the Grand Vizier in solemn council with

the magnates of the realm, spelling his way through the hated newspaper,

and finally delivering his profound decision: "This thing means mischief

--it is too darkly, too suspiciously inoffensive--suppress it!  Warn the

publisher that we can not have this sort of thing: put the editor in

prison!"



The newspaper business has its inconveniences in Constantinople.  Two

Greek papers and one French one were suppressed here within a few days of

each other.  No victories of the Cretans are allowed to be printed.  From

time to time the Grand Vizier sends a notice to the various editors that

the Cretan insurrection is entirely suppressed, and although that editor

knows better, he still has to print the notice.  The Levant Herald is too

fond of speaking praisefully of Americans to be popular with the Sultan,

who does not relish our sympathy with the Cretans, and therefore that

paper has to be particularly circumspect in order to keep out of trouble.

Once the editor, forgetting the official notice in his paper that the

Cretans were crushed out, printed a letter of a very different tenor,

from the American Consul in Crete, and was fined two hundred and fifty

dollars for it.  Shortly he printed another from the same source and was

imprisoned three months for his pains.  I think I could get the assistant

editorship of the Levant Herald, but I am going to try to worry along

without it.



To suppress a paper here involves the ruin of the publisher, almost.  But

in Naples I think they speculate on misfortunes of that kind.  Papers are

suppressed there every day, and spring up the next day under a new name.

During the ten days or a fortnight we staid there one paper was murdered

and resurrected twice.  The newsboys are smart there, just as they are

elsewhere.  They take advantage of popular weaknesses.  When they find

they are not likely to sell out, they approach a citizen mysteriously,

and say in a low voice--"Last copy, sir: double price; paper just been

suppressed!"  The man buys it, of course, and finds nothing in it.  They

do say--I do not vouch for it--but they do say that men sometimes print a

vast edition of a paper, with a ferociously seditious article in it,

distribute it quickly among the newsboys, and clear out till the

Government's indignation cools.  It pays well.  Confiscation don't amount

to any thing.  The type and presses are not worth taking care of.



There is only one English newspaper in Naples.  It has seventy

subscribers.  The publisher is getting rich very deliberately--very

deliberately indeed.



I never shall want another Turkish lunch.  The cooking apparatus was in

the little lunch room, near the bazaar, and it was all open to the

street.  The cook was slovenly, and so was the table, and it had no cloth

on it.  The fellow took a mass of sausage meat and coated it round a wire

and laid it on a charcoal fire to cook.  When it was done, he laid it

aside and a dog walked sadly in and nipped it.  He smelt it first, and

probably recognized the remains of a friend.  The cook took it away from

him and laid it before us.  Jack said, "I pass"--he plays euchre

sometimes--and we all passed in turn.  Then the cook baked a broad, flat,

wheaten cake, greased it well with the sausage, and started towards us

with it.  It dropped in the dirt, and he picked it up and polished it on

his breeches, and laid it before us.  Jack said, "I pass."  We all

passed.  He put some eggs in a frying pan, and stood pensively prying

slabs of meat from between his teeth with a fork.  Then he used the fork

to turn the eggs with--and brought them along.  Jack said "Pass again."

All followed suit.  We did not know what to do, and so we ordered a new

ration of sausage.  The cook got out his wire, apportioned a proper

amount of sausage-meat, spat it on his hands and fell to work!  This

time, with one accord, we all passed out.  We paid and left.  That is

all I learned about Turkish lunches.  A Turkish lunch is good, no doubt,

but it has its little drawbacks.



When I think how I have been swindled by books of Oriental travel, I want

a tourist for breakfast.  For years and years I have dreamed of the

wonders of the Turkish bath; for years and years I have promised myself

that I would yet enjoy one.  Many and many a time, in fancy, I have lain

in the marble bath, and breathed the slumbrous fragrance of Eastern

spices that filled the air; then passed through a weird and complicated

system of pulling and hauling, and drenching and scrubbing, by a gang of

naked savages who loomed vast and vaguely through the steaming mists,

like demons; then rested for a while on a divan fit for a king; then

passed through another complex ordeal, and one more fearful than the

first; and, finally, swathed in soft fabrics, been conveyed to a princely

saloon and laid on a bed of eider down, where eunuchs, gorgeous of

costume, fanned me while I drowsed and dreamed, or contentedly gazed at

the rich hangings of the apartment, the soft carpets, the sumptuous

furniture, the pictures, and drank delicious coffee, smoked the soothing

narghili, and dropped, at the last, into tranquil repose, lulled by

sensuous odors from unseen censers, by the gentle influence of the

narghili's Persian tobacco, and by the music of fountains that

counterfeited the pattering of summer rain.



That was the picture, just as I got it from incendiary books of travel.

It was a poor, miserable imposture.  The reality is no more like it than

the Five Points are like the Garden of Eden.  They received me in a great

court, paved with marble slabs; around it were broad galleries, one above

another, carpeted with seedy matting, railed with unpainted balustrades,

and furnished with huge rickety chairs, cushioned with rusty old

mattresses, indented with impressions left by the forms of nine

successive generations of men who had reposed upon them.  The place was

vast, naked, dreary; its court a barn, its galleries stalls for human

horses.  The cadaverous, half nude varlets that served in the

establishment had nothing of poetry in their appearance, nothing of

romance, nothing of Oriental splendor.  They shed no entrancing odors--

just the contrary.  Their hungry eyes and their lank forms continually

suggested one glaring, unsentimental fact--they wanted what they term in

California "a square meal."



I went into one of the racks and undressed.  An unclean starveling

wrapped a gaudy table-cloth about his loins, and hung a white rag over my

shoulders.  If I had had a tub then, it would have come natural to me to

take in washing.  I was then conducted down stairs into the wet, slippery

court, and the first things that attracted my attention were my heels.

My fall excited no comment.  They expected it, no doubt.  It belonged in

the list of softening, sensuous influences peculiar to this home of

Eastern luxury.  It was softening enough, certainly, but its application

was not happy.  They now gave me a pair of wooden clogs--benches in

miniature, with leather straps over them to confine my feet (which they

would have done, only I do not wear No. 13s.) These things dangled

uncomfortably by the straps when I lifted up my feet, and came down in

awkward and unexpected places when I put them on the floor again, and

sometimes turned sideways and wrenched my ankles out of joint.  However,

it was all Oriental luxury, and I did what I could to enjoy it.



They put me in another part of the barn and laid me on a stuffy sort of

pallet, which was not made of cloth of gold, or Persian shawls, but was

merely the unpretending sort of thing I have seen in the negro quarters

of Arkansas.  There was nothing whatever in this dim marble prison but

five more of these biers.  It was a very solemn place.  I expected that

the spiced odors of Araby were going to steal over my senses now, but

they did not.  A copper-colored skeleton, with a rag around him, brought

me a glass decanter of water, with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top of

it, and a pliant stem a yard long, with a brass mouth-piece to it.



It was the famous "narghili" of the East--the thing the Grand Turk smokes

in the pictures.  This began to look like luxury.  I took one blast at

it, and it was sufficient; the smoke went in a great volume down into my

stomach, my lungs, even into the uttermost parts of my frame.  I exploded

one mighty cough, and it was as if Vesuvius had let go.  For the next

five minutes I smoked at every pore, like a frame house that is on fire

on the inside.  Not any more narghili for me.  The smoke had a vile

taste, and the taste of a thousand infidel tongues that remained on that

brass mouthpiece was viler still.  I was getting discouraged.  Whenever,

hereafter, I see the cross-legged Grand Turk smoking his narghili, in

pretended bliss, on the outside of a paper of Connecticut tobacco, I

shall know him for the shameless humbug he is.



This prison was filled with hot air.  When I had got warmed up

sufficiently to prepare me for a still warmer temperature, they took me

where it was--into a marble room, wet, slippery and steamy, and laid me

out on a raised platform in the centre.  It was very warm.  Presently my

man sat me down by a tank of hot water, drenched me well, gloved his hand

with a coarse mitten, and began to polish me all over with it.  I began

to smell disagreeably.  The more he polished the worse I smelt.  It was

alarming.  I said to him:



"I perceive that I am pretty far gone.  It is plain that I ought to be

buried without any unnecessary delay.  Perhaps you had better go after my

friends at once, because the weather is warm, and I can not 'keep' long."



He went on scrubbing, and paid no attention.  I soon saw that he was

reducing my size.  He bore hard on his mitten, and from under it rolled

little cylinders, like maccaroni.  It could not be dirt, for it was too

white.  He pared me down in this way for a long time.  Finally I said:



"It is a tedious process.  It will take hours to trim me to the size you

want me; I will wait; go and borrow a jack-plane."



He paid no attention at all.



After a while he brought a basin, some soap, and something that seemed to

be the tail of a horse.  He made up a prodigious quantity of soap-suds,

deluged me with them from head to foot, without warning me to shut my

eyes, and then swabbed me viciously with the horse-tail.  Then he left me

there, a snowy statue of lather, and went away.  When I got tired of

waiting I went and hunted him up.  He was propped against the wall, in

another room, asleep.  I woke him.  He was not disconcerted.  He took me

back and flooded me with hot water, then turbaned my head, swathed me

with dry table-cloths, and conducted me to a latticed chicken-coop in one

of the galleries, and pointed to one of those Arkansas beds.  I mounted

it, and vaguely expected the odors of Araby a gain.  They did not come.



The blank, unornamented coop had nothing about it of that oriental

voluptuousness one reads of so much.  It was more suggestive of the

county hospital than any thing else.  The skinny servitor brought a

narghili, and I got him to take it out again without wasting any time

about it.  Then he brought the world-renowned Turkish coffee that poets

have sung so rapturously for many generations, and I seized upon it as

the last hope that was left of my old dreams of Eastern luxury.  It was

another fraud.  Of all the unchristian beverages that ever passed my

lips, Turkish coffee is the worst.  The cup is small, it is smeared with

grounds; the coffee is black, thick, unsavory of smell, and execrable in

taste.  The bottom of the cup has a muddy sediment in it half an inch

deep.  This goes down your throat, and portions of it lodge by the way,

and produce a tickling aggravation that keeps you barking and coughing

for an hour.



Here endeth my experience of the celebrated Turkish bath, and here also

endeth my dream of the bliss the mortal revels in who passes through it.

It is a malignant swindle.  The man who enjoys it is qualified to enjoy

any thing that is repulsive to sight or sense, and he that can invest it

with a charm of poetry is able to do the same with any thing else in the

world that is tedious, and wretched, and dismal, and nasty.









CHAPTER XXXV.



We left a dozen passengers in Constantinople, and sailed through the

beautiful Bosporus and far up into the Black Sea.  We left them in the

clutches of the celebrated Turkish guide, "FAR-AWAY MOSES," who will

seduce them into buying a ship-load of ottar of roses, splendid Turkish

vestments, and ail manner of curious things they can never have any use

for.  Murray's invaluable guide-books have mentioned 'Far-away Moses'

name, and he is a made man.  He rejoices daily in the fact that he is a

recognized celebrity.  However, we can not alter our established customs

to please the whims of guides; we can not show partialities this late in

the day.  Therefore, ignoring this fellow's brilliant fame, and ignoring

the fanciful name he takes such pride in, we called him Ferguson, just as

we had done with all other guides.  It has kept him in a state of

smothered exasperation all the time.  Yet we meant him no harm.  After he

has gotten himself up regardless of expense, in showy, baggy trowsers,

yellow, pointed slippers, fiery fez, silken jacket of blue, voluminous

waist-sash of fancy Persian stuff filled with a battery of silver-mounted

horse-pistols, and has strapped on his terrible scimitar, he considers it

an unspeakable humiliation to be called Ferguson.  It can not be helped.

All guides are Fergusons to us.  We can not master their dreadful foreign

names.



Sebastopol is probably the worst battered town in Russia or any where

else.  But we ought to be pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have been

in no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where we

felt that to be Americans was a sufficient visa for our passports.  The

moment the anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediately

dispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any

assistance to us, and to invite us to make ourselves at home in

Sebastopol!  If you know Russia, you know that this was a wild stretch of

hospitality.  They are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worry

them excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to a

complicated passport system.  Had we come from any other country we could

not have had permission to enter Sebastopol and leave again under three

days--but as it was, we were at liberty to go and come when and where we

pleased.  Every body in Constantinople warned us to be very careful about

our passports, see that they were strictly 'en regle', and never to

mislay them for a moment: and they told us of numerous instances of

Englishmen and others who were delayed days, weeks, and even months, in

Sebastopol, on account of trifling informalities in their passports, and

for which they were not to blame.  I had lost my passport, and was

traveling under my room-mate's, who stayed behind in Constantinople to

await our return.  To read the description of him in that passport and

then look at me, any man could see that I was no more like him than I am

like Hercules.  So I went into the harbor of Sebastopol with fear and

trembling--full of a vague, horrible apprehension that I was going to be

found out and hanged.  But all that time my true passport had been

floating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag.  They never

asked us for any other.



We have had a great many Russian and English gentlemen and ladies on

board to-day, and the time has passed cheerfully away.  They were all

happy-spirited people, and I never heard our mother tongue sound so

pleasantly as it did when it fell from those English lips in this far-off

land.  I talked to the Russians a good deal, just to be friendly, and

they talked to me from the same motive; I am sure that both enjoyed the

conversation, but never a word of it either of us understood.  I did most

of my talking to those English people though, and I am sorry we can not

carry some of them along with us.



We have gone whithersoever we chose, to-day, and have met with nothing

but the kindest attentions.  Nobody inquired whether we had any passports

or not.



Several of the officers of the Government have suggested that we take the

ship to a little watering-place thirty miles from here, and pay the

Emperor of Russia a visit.  He is rusticating there.  These officers said

they would take it upon themselves to insure us a cordial reception.

They said if we would go, they would not only telegraph the Emperor, but

send a special courier overland to announce our coming.  Our time is so

short, though, and more especially our coal is so nearly out, that we

judged it best to forego the rare pleasure of holding social intercourse

with an Emperor.



Ruined Pompeii is in good condition compared to Sebastopol.  Here, you

may look in whatsoever direction you please, and your eye encounters

scarcely any thing but ruin, ruin, ruin!--fragments of houses, crumbled

walls, torn and ragged hills, devastation every where!  It is as if a

mighty earthquake had spent all its terrible forces upon this one little

spot.  For eighteen long months the storms of war beat upon the helpless

town, and left it at last the saddest wreck that ever the sun has looked

upon.  Not one solitary house escaped unscathed--not one remained

habitable, even.  Such utter and complete ruin one could hardly conceive

of.  The houses had all been solid, dressed stone structures; most of

them were ploughed through and through by cannon balls--unroofed and

sliced down from eaves to foundation--and now a row of them, half a mile

long, looks merely like an endless procession of battered chimneys.  No

semblance of a house remains in such as these.  Some of the larger

buildings had corners knocked off; pillars cut in two; cornices smashed;

holes driven straight through the walls.  Many of these holes are as

round and as cleanly cut as if they had been made with an auger.  Others

are half pierced through, and the clean impression is there in the rock,

as smooth and as shapely as if it were done in putty.  Here and there a

ball still sticks in a wall, and from it iron tears trickle down and

discolor the stone.



The battle-fields were pretty close together.  The Malakoff tower is on a

hill which is right in the edge of the town.  The Redan was within rifle-

shot of the Malakoff; Inkerman was a mile away; and Balaklava removed but

an hour's ride.  The French trenches, by which they approached and

invested the Malakoff were carried so close under its sloping sides that

one might have stood by the Russian guns and tossed a stone into them.

Repeatedly, during three terrible days, they swarmed up the little

Malakoff hill, and were beaten back with terrible slaughter.  Finally,

they captured the place, and drove the Russians out, who then tried to

retreat into the town, but the English had taken the Redan, and shut them

off with a wall of flame; there was nothing for them to do but go back

and retake the Malakoff or die under its guns.  They did go back; they

took the Malakoff and retook it two or three times, but their desperate

valor could not avail, and they had to give up at last.



These fearful fields, where such tempests of death used to rage, are

peaceful enough now; no sound is heard, hardly a living thing moves about

them, they are lonely and silent--their desolation is complete.



There was nothing else to do, and so every body went to hunting relics.

They have stocked the ship with them.  They brought them from the

Malakoff, from the Redan, Inkerman, Balaklava--every where.  They have

brought cannon balls, broken ramrods, fragments of shell--iron enough to

freight a sloop.  Some have even brought bones--brought them laboriously

from great distances, and were grieved to hear the surgeon pronounce them

only bones of mules and oxen.  I knew Blucher would not lose an

opportunity like this.  He brought a sack full on board and was going for

another.  I prevailed upon him not to go.  He has already turned his

state-room into a museum of worthless trumpery, which he has gathered up

in his travels.  He is labeling his trophies, now.  I picked up one a

while ago, and found it marked "Fragment of a Russian General."  I

carried it out to get a better light upon it--it was nothing but a couple

of teeth and part of the jaw-bone of a horse.  I said with some asperity:



"Fragment of a Russian General!  This is absurd.  Are you never going to

learn any sense?"



He only said: "Go slow--the old woman won't know any different."  [His

aunt.]



This person gathers mementoes with a perfect recklessness, now-a-days;

mixes them all up together, and then serenely labels them without any

regard to truth, propriety, or even plausibility.  I have found him

breaking a stone in two, and labeling half of it "Chunk busted from the

pulpit of Demosthenes," and the other half "Darnick from the Tomb of

Abelard and Heloise."  I have known him to gather up a handful of pebbles

by the roadside, and bring them on board ship and label them as coming

from twenty celebrated localities five hundred miles apart.  I

remonstrate against these outrages upon reason and truth, of course, but

it does no good.  I get the same tranquil, unanswerable reply every time:



"It don't signify--the old woman won't know any different."



Ever since we three or four fortunate ones made the midnight trip to

Athens, it has afforded him genuine satisfaction to give every body in

the ship a pebble from the Mars-hill where St. Paul preached.  He got all

those pebbles on the sea shore, abreast the ship, but professes to have

gathered them from one of our party.  However, it is not of any use for

me to expose the deception--it affords him pleasure, and does no harm to

any body.  He says he never expects to run out of mementoes of St. Paul

as long as he is in reach of a sand-bank.  Well, he is no worse than

others.  I notice that all travelers supply deficiencies in their

collections in the same way.  I shall never have any confidence in such

things again while I live.









CHAPTER XXXVI.



We have got so far east, now--a hundred and fifty-five degrees of

longitude from San Francisco--that my watch can not "keep the hang" of

the time any more.  It has grown discouraged, and stopped.  I think it

did a wise thing.  The difference in time between Sebastopol and the

Pacific coast is enormous.  When it is six o'clock in the morning here,

it is somewhere about week before last in California.  We are excusable

for getting a little tangled as to time.  These distractions and

distresses about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid my

mind was so much affected that I never would have any appreciation of

time again; but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehending

when it was dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, and

I am tortured with doubts and fears no more.



Odessa is about twenty hours' run from Sebastopol, and is the most

northerly port in the Black Sea.  We came here to get coal, principally.

The city has a population of one hundred and thirty-three thousand, and

is growing faster than any other small city out of America.  It is a free

port, and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world.

Its roadstead is full of ships.  Engineers are at work, now, turning the

open roadstead into a spacious artificial harbor.  It is to be almost

inclosed by massive stone piers, one of which will extend into the sea

over three thousand feet in a straight line.



I have not felt so much at home for a long time as I did when I "raised

the hill" and stood in Odessa for the first time.  It looked just like an

American city; fine, broad streets, and straight as well; low houses,

(two or three stories,) wide, neat, and free from any quaintness of

architectural ornamentation; locust trees bordering the sidewalks (they

call them acacias;) a stirring, business-look about the streets and the

stores; fast walkers; a familiar new look about the houses and every

thing; yea, and a driving and smothering cloud of dust that was so like a

message from our own dear native land that we could hardly refrain from

shedding a few grateful tears and execrations in the old time-honored

American way.  Look up the street or down the street, this way or that

way, we saw only America!  There was not one thing to remind us that we

were in Russia.  We walked for some little distance, reveling in this

home vision, and then we came upon a church and a hack-driver, and

presto! the illusion vanished!  The church had a slender-spired dome that

rounded inward at its base, and looked like a turnip turned upside down,

and the hackman seemed to be dressed in a long petticoat with out any

hoops.  These things were essentially foreign, and so were the carriages

--but every body knows about these things, and there is no occasion for

my describing them.



We were only to stay here a day and a night and take in coal; we

consulted the guide-books and were rejoiced to know that there were no

sights in Odessa to see; and so we had one good, untrammeled holyday on

our hands, with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy

ourselves.  We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful

and wonderful costumes from the back country; examined the populace as

far as eyes could do it; and closed the entertainment with an ice-cream

debauch.  We do not get ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we are

apt to dissipate to excess.  We never cared any thing about ice-cream at

home, but we look upon it with a sort of idolatry now that it is so

scarce in these red-hot climates of the East.



We only found two pieces of statuary, and this was another blessing.  One

was a bronze image of the Duc de Richelieu, grand-nephew of the splendid

Cardinal.  It stood in a spacious, handsome promenade, overlooking the

sea, and from its base a vast flight of stone steps led down to the

harbor--two hundred of them, fifty feet long, and a wide landing at the

bottom of every twenty.  It is a noble staircase, and from a distance the

people toiling up it looked like insects.  I mention this statue and this

stairway because they have their story.  Richelieu founded Odessa--

watched over it with paternal care--labored with a fertile brain and a

wise understanding for its best interests--spent his fortune freely to

the same end--endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet

make it one of the great cities of the Old World--built this noble

stairway with money from his own private purse--and--.  Well, the people

for whom he had done so much, let him walk down these same steps, one

day, unattended, old, poor, without a second coat to his back; and when,

years afterwards, he died in Sebastopol in poverty and neglect, they

called a meeting, subscribed liberally, and immediately erected this

tasteful monument to his memory, and named a great street after him.

It reminds me of what Robert Burns' mother said when they erected a

stately monument to his memory: "Ah, Robbie, ye asked them for bread and

they hae gi'en ye a stane."



The people of Odessa have warmly recommended us to go and call on the

Emperor, as did the Sebastopolians.  They have telegraphed his Majesty,

and he has signified his willingness to grant us an audience.  So we are

getting up the anchors and preparing to sail to his watering-place.  What

a scratching around there will be, now! what a holding of important

meetings and appointing of solemn committees!--and what a furbishing up

of claw-hammer coats and white silk neck-ties!  As this fearful ordeal we

are about to pass through pictures itself to my fancy in all its dread

sublimity, I begin to feel my fierce desire to converse with a genuine

Emperor cooling down and passing away.  What am I to do with my hands?

What am I to do with my feet?  What in the world am I to do with myself?









CHAPTER XXXVII.



We anchored here at Yalta, Russia, two or three days ago.  To me the

place was a vision of the Sierras.  The tall, gray mountains that back

it, their sides bristling with pines--cloven with ravines--here and there

a hoary rock towering into view--long, straight streaks sweeping down

from the summit to the sea, marking the passage of some avalanche of

former times--all these were as like what one sees in the Sierras as if

the one were a portrait of the other.  The little village of Yalta

nestles at the foot of an amphitheatre which slopes backward and upward

to the wall of hills, and looks as if it might have sunk quietly down to

its present position from a higher elevation.  This depression is covered

with the great parks and gardens of noblemen, and through the mass of

green foliage the bright colors of their palaces bud out here and there

like flowers.  It is a beautiful spot.



We had the United States Consul on board--the Odessa Consul.  We

assembled in the cabin and commanded him to tell us what we must do to be

saved, and tell us quickly.  He made a speech.  The first thing he said

fell like a blight on every hopeful spirit: he had never seen a court

reception.  (Three groans for the Consul.)  But he said he had seen

receptions at the Governor General's in Odessa, and had often listened to

people's experiences of receptions at the Russian and other courts, and

believed he knew very well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay.

(Hope budded again.)  He said we were many; the summer palace was small--

a mere mansion; doubtless we should be received in summer fashion--in the

garden; we would stand in a row, all the gentlemen in swallow-tail coats,

white kids, and white neck-ties, and the ladies in light-colored silks,

or something of that kind; at the proper moment--12 meridian--the

Emperor, attended by his suite arrayed in splendid uniforms, would appear

and walk slowly along the line, bowing to some, and saying two or three

words to others.  At the moment his Majesty appeared, a universal,

delighted, enthusiastic smile ought to break out like a rash among the

passengers--a smile of love, of gratification, of admiration--and with

one accord, the party must begin to bow--not obsequiously, but

respectfully, and with dignity; at the end of fifteen minutes the Emperor

would go in the house, and we could run along home again.  We felt

immensely relieved.  It seemed, in a manner, easy.  There was not a man

in the party but believed that with a little practice he could stand in a

row, especially if there were others along; there was not a man but

believed he could bow without tripping on his coat tail and breaking his

neck; in a word, we came to believe we were equal to any item in the

performance except that complicated smile.  The Consul also said we ought

to draft a little address to the Emperor, and present it to one of his

aides-de-camp, who would forward it to him at the proper time.

Therefore, five gentlemen were appointed to prepare the document, and the

fifty others went sadly smiling about the ship--practicing.  During the

next twelve hours we had the general appearance, somehow, of being at a

funeral, where every body was sorry the death had occurred, but glad it

was over--where every body was smiling, and yet broken-hearted.



A committee went ashore to wait on his Excellency the Governor-General,

and learn our fate.  At the end of three hours of boding suspense, they

came back and said the Emperor would receive us at noon the next day--

would send carriages for us--would hear the address in person.  The Grand

Duke Michael had sent to invite us to his palace also.  Any man could see

that there was an intention here to show that Russia's friendship for

America was so genuine as to render even her private citizens objects

worthy of kindly attentions.



At the appointed hour we drove out three miles, and assembled in the

handsome garden in front of the Emperor's palace.



We formed a circle under the trees before the door, for there was no one

room in the house able to accommodate our three-score persons

comfortably, and in a few minutes the imperial family came out bowing and

smiling, and stood in our midst.  A number of great dignitaries of the

Empire, in undress unit forms, came with them.  With every bow, his

Majesty said a word of welcome.  I copy these speeches.  There is

character in them--Russian character--which is politeness itself, and the

genuine article.  The French are polite, but it is often mere ceremonious

politeness.  A Russian imbues his polite things with a heartiness, both

of phrase and expression, that compels belief in their sincerity.  As I

was saying, the Czar punctuated his speeches with bows:



"Good morning--I am glad to see you--I am gratified--I am delighted--I am

happy to receive you!"



All took off their hats, and the Consul inflicted the address on him.  He

bore it with unflinching fortitude; then took the rusty-looking document

and handed it to some great officer or other, to be filed away among the

archives of Russia--in the stove.  He thanked us for the address, and

said he was very much pleased to see us, especially as such friendly

relations existed between Russia and the United States.  The Empress said

the Americans were favorites in Russia, and she hoped the Russians were

similarly regarded in America.  These were all the speeches that were

made, and I recommend them to parties who present policemen with gold

watches, as models of brevity and point.  After this the Empress went and

talked sociably (for an Empress) with various ladies around the circle;

several gentlemen entered into a disjointed general conversation with the

Emperor; the Dukes and Princes, Admirals and Maids of Honor dropped into

free-and-easy chat with first one and then another of our party, and

whoever chose stepped forward and spoke with the modest little Grand

Duchess Marie, the Czar's daughter.  She is fourteen years old, light-

haired, blue-eyed, unassuming and pretty.  Every body talks English.



The Emperor wore a cap, frock coat and pantaloons, all of some kind of

plain white drilling--cotton or linen and sported no jewelry or any

insignia whatever of rank.  No costume could be less ostentatious.  He is

very tall and spare, and a determined-looking man, though a very

pleasant-looking one nevertheless.  It is easy to see that he is kind and

affectionate There is something very noble in his expression when his cap

is off.  There is none of that cunning in his eye that all of us noticed

in Louis Napoleon's.



The Empress and the little Grand Duchess wore simple suits of foulard (or

foulard silk, I don't know which is proper,) with a small blue spot in

it; the dresses were trimmed with blue; both ladies wore broad blue

sashes about their waists; linen collars and clerical ties of muslin;

low-crowned straw-hats trimmed with blue velvet; parasols and flesh-

colored gloves The Grand Duchess had no heels on her shoes.  I do not

know this of my own knowledge, but one of our ladies told me so.  I was

not looking at her shoes.  I was glad to observe that she wore her own

hair, plaited in thick braids against the back of her head, instead of

the uncomely thing they call a waterfall, which is about as much like a

waterfall as a canvas-covered ham is like a cataract.  Taking the kind

expression that is in the Emperor's face and the gentleness that is in

his young daughter's into consideration, I wondered if it would not tax

the Czar's firmness to the utmost to condemn a supplicating wretch to

misery in the wastes of Siberia if she pleaded for him.  Every time their

eyes met, I saw more and more what a tremendous power that weak,

diffident school-girl could wield if she chose to do it.  Many and many a

time she might rule the Autocrat of Russia, whose lightest word is law to

seventy millions of human beings!  She was only a girl, and she looked

like a thousand others I have seen, but never a girl provoked such a

novel and peculiar interest in me before.  A strange, new sensation is a

rare thing in this hum-drum life, and I had it here.  There was nothing

stale or worn out about the thoughts and feelings the situation and the

circumstances created.  It seemed strange--stranger than I can tell--to

think that the central figure in the cluster of men and women, chatting

here under the trees like the most ordinary individual in the land, was a

man who could open his lips and ships would fly through the waves,

locomotives would speed over the plains, couriers would hurry from

village to village, a hundred telegraphs would flash the word to the four

corners of an Empire that stretches its vast proportions over a seventh

part of the habitable globe, and a countless multitude of men would

spring to do his bidding.  I had a sort of vague desire to examine his

hands and see if they were of flesh and blood, like other men's.  Here

was a man who could do this wonderful thing, and yet if I chose I could

knock him down.  The case was plain, but it seemed preposterous,

nevertheless--as preposterous as trying to knock down a mountain or wipe

out a continent.  If this man sprained his ankle, a million miles of

telegraph would carry the news over mountains--valleys--uninhabited

deserts--under the trackless sea--and ten thousand newspapers would prate

of it; if he were grievously ill, all the nations would know it before

the sun rose again; if he dropped lifeless where he stood, his fall might

shake the thrones of half a world!  If I could have stolen his coat, I

would have done it.  When I meet a man like that, I want something to

remember him by.



As a general thing, we have been shown through palaces by some plush-

legged filagreed flunkey or other, who charged a franc for it; but after

talking with the company half an hour, the Emperor of Russia and his

family conducted us all through their mansion themselves.  They made no

charge.  They seemed to take a real pleasure in it.



We spent half an hour idling through the palace, admiring the cosy

apartments and the rich but eminently home-like appointments of the

place, and then the Imperial family bade our party a kind good-bye, and

proceeded to count the spoons.



An invitation was extended to us to visit the palace of the eldest son,

the Crown Prince of Russia, which was near at hand.  The young man was

absent, but the Dukes and Countesses and Princes went over the premises

with us as leisurely as was the case at the Emperor's, and conversation

continued as lively as ever.



It was a little after one o'clock, now.  We drove to the Grand Duke

Michael's, a mile away, in response to his invitation, previously given.



We arrived in twenty minutes from the Emperor's.  It is a lovely place.

The beautiful palace nestles among the grand old groves of the park, the

park sits in the lap of the picturesque crags and hills, and both look

out upon the breezy ocean.  In the park are rustic seats, here and there,

in secluded nooks that are dark with shade; there are rivulets of crystal

water; there are lakelets, with inviting, grassy banks; there are

glimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness of

foliage; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the

trunks of forest trees; there are miniature marble temples perched upon

gray old crags; there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broad

expanse of landscape and ocean.  The palace is modeled after the choicest

forms of Grecian architecture, and its wide colonnades surround a central

court that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their

fragrance, and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer

air, and may possibly breed mosquitoes, but I do not think it does.



The Grand Duke and his Duchess came out, and the presentation ceremonies

were as simple as they had been at the Emperor's.  In a few minutes,

conversation was under way, as before.  The Empress appeared in the

verandah, and the little Grand Duchess came out into the crowd.  They had

beaten us there.  In a few minutes, the Emperor came himself on

horseback.  It was very pleasant.  You can appreciate it if you have ever

visited royalty and felt occasionally that possibly you might be wearing

out your welcome--though as a general thing, I believe, royalty is not

scrupulous about discharging you when it is done with you.



The Grand Duke is the third brother of the Emperor, is about thirty-seven

years old, perhaps, and is the princeliest figure in Russia.  He is even

taller than the Czar, as straight as an Indian, and bears himself like

one of those gorgeous knights we read about in romances of the Crusades.

He looks like a great-hearted fellow who would pitch an enemy into the

river in a moment, and then jump in and risk his life fishing him out

again.  The stories they tell of him show him to be of a brave and

generous nature.  He must have been desirous of proving that Americans

were welcome guests in the imperial palaces of Russia, because he rode

all the way to Yalta and escorted our procession to the Emperor's

himself, and kept his aids scurrying about, clearing the road and

offering assistance wherever it could be needed.  We were rather familiar

with him then, because we did not know who he was.  We recognized him

now, and appreciated the friendly spirit that prompted him to do us a

favor that any other Grand Duke in the world would have doubtless

declined to do.  He had plenty of servitors whom he could have sent, but

he chose to attend to the matter himself.



The Grand Duke was dressed in the handsome and showy uniform of a Cossack

officer.  The Grand Duchess had on a white alpaca robe, with the seams

and gores trimmed with black barb lace, and a little gray hat with a

feather of the same color.  She is young, rather pretty modest and

unpretending, and full of winning politeness.



Our party walked all through the house, and then the nobility escorted

them all over the grounds, and finally brought them back to the palace

about half-past two o'clock to breakfast.  They called it breakfast, but

we would have called it luncheon.  It consisted of two kinds of wine;

tea, bread, cheese, and cold meats, and was served on the centre-tables

in the reception room and the verandahs--anywhere that was convenient;

there was no ceremony.  It was a sort of picnic.  I had heard before that

we were to breakfast there, but Blucher said he believed Baker's boy had

suggested it to his Imperial Highness.  I think not--though it would be

like him.  Baker's boy is the famine-breeder of the ship.  He is always

hungry.  They say he goes about the state-rooms when the passengers are

out, and eats up all the soap.  And they say he eats oakum.  They say he

will eat any thing he can get between meals, but he prefers oakum.  He

does not like oakum for dinner, but he likes it for a lunch, at odd

hours, or any thing that way.  It makes him very disagreeable, because it

makes his breath bad, and keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar.  Baker's

boy may have suggested the breakfast, but I hope he did not.  It went off

well, anyhow.  The illustrious host moved about from place to place, and

helped to destroy the provisions and keep the conversation lively, and

the Grand Duchess talked with the verandah parties and such as had

satisfied their appetites and straggled out from the reception room.



The Grand Duke's tea was delicious.  They give one a lemon to squeeze

into it, or iced milk, if he prefers it.  The former is best.  This tea

is brought overland from China.  It injures the article to transport it

by sea.



When it was time to go, we bade our distinguished hosts good-bye, and

they retired happy and contented to their apartments to count their

spoons.



We had spent the best part of half a day in the home of royalty, and had

been as cheerful and comfortable all the time as we could have been in

the ship.  I would as soon have thought of being cheerful in Abraham's

bosom as in the palace of an Emperor.  I supposed that Emperors were

terrible people.  I thought they never did any thing but wear magnificent

crowns and red velvet dressing-gowns with dabs of wool sewed on them in

spots, and sit on thrones and scowl at the flunkies and the people in the

parquette, and order Dukes and Duchesses off to execution.  I find,

however, that when one is so fortunate as to get behind the scenes and

see them at home and in the privacy of their firesides, they are

strangely like common mortals.  They are pleasanter to look upon then

than they are in their theatrical aspect.  It seems to come as natural to

them to dress and act like other people as it is to put a friend's cedar

pencil in your pocket when you are done using it.  But I can never have

any confidence in the tinsel kings of the theatre after this.  It will be

a great loss.  I used to take such a thrilling pleasure in them.  But,

hereafter, I will turn me sadly away and say;



"This does not answer--this isn't the style of king that I am acquainted

with."



When they swagger around the stage in jeweled crowns and splendid robes,

I shall feel bound to observe that all the Emperors that ever I was

personally acquainted with wore the commonest sort of clothes, and did

not swagger.  And when they come on the stage attended by a vast body-

guard of supes in helmets and tin breastplates, it will be my duty as

well as my pleasure to inform the ignorant that no crowned head of my

acquaintance has a soldier any where about his house or his person.



Possibly it may be thought that our party tarried too long, or did other

improper things, but such was not the case.  The company felt that they

were occupying an unusually responsible position--they were representing

the people of America, not the Government--and therefore they were

careful to do their best to perform their high mission with credit.



On the other hand, the Imperial families, no doubt, considered that in

entertaining us they were more especially entertaining the people of

America than they could by showering attentions on a whole platoon of

ministers plenipotentiary and therefore they gave to the event its

fullest significance, as an expression of good will and friendly feeling

toward the entire country.  We took the kindnesses we received as

attentions thus directed, of course, and not to ourselves as a party.

That we felt a personal pride in being received as the representatives of

a nation, we do not deny; that we felt a national pride in the warm

cordiality of that reception, can not be doubted.



Our poet has been rigidly suppressed, from the time we let go the anchor.

When it was announced that we were going to visit the Emperor of Russia,

the fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained ineffable

bosh for four-and-twenty hours.  Our original anxiety as to what we were

going to do with ourselves, was suddenly transformed into anxiety about

what we were going to do with our poet.  The problem was solved at last.

Two alternatives were offered him--he must either swear a dreadful oath

that he would not issue a line of his poetry while he was in the Czar's

dominions, or else remain under guard on board the ship until we were

safe at Constantinople again.  He fought the dilemma long, but yielded at

last.  It was a great deliverance.  Perhaps the savage reader would like

a specimen of his style.  I do not mean this term to be offensive.  I

only use it because "the gentle reader" has been used so often that any

change from it can not but be refreshing:



          "Save us and sanctify us, and finally, then,

          See good provisions we enjoy while we journey to Jerusalem.

          For so man proposes, which it is most true

          And time will wait for none, nor for us too."



The sea has been unusually rough all day.  However, we have had a lively

time of it, anyhow.  We have had quite a run of visitors.  The Governor-

General came, and we received him with a salute of nine guns.  He brought

his family with him.  I observed that carpets were spread from the pier-

head to his carriage for him to walk on, though I have seen him walk

there without any carpet when he was not on business.  I thought may be

he had what the accidental insurance people might call an extra-hazardous

polish ("policy" joke, but not above mediocrity,) on his boots, and

wished to protect them, but I examined and could not see that they were

blacked any better than usual.  It may have been that he had forgotten

his carpet, before, but he did not have it with him, anyhow.  He was an

exceedingly pleasant old gentleman; we all liked him, especially Blucher.

When he went away, Blucher invited him to come again and fetch his carpet

along.



Prince Dolgorouki and a Grand Admiral or two, whom we had seen yesterday

at the reception, came on board also.  I was a little distant with these

parties, at first, because when I have been visiting Emperors I do not

like to be too familiar with people I only know by reputation, and whose

moral characters and standing in society I can not be thoroughly

acquainted with.  I judged it best to be a little offish, at first.  I

said to myself, Princes and Counts and Grand Admirals are very well, but

they are not Emperors, and one can not be too particular about who he

associates with.



Baron Wrangel came, also.  He used to be Russian Ambassador at

Washington.  I told him I had an uncle who fell down a shaft and broke

himself in two, as much as a year before that.  That was a falsehood, but

then I was not going to let any man eclipse me on surprising adventures,

merely for the want of a little invention.  The Baron is a fine man, and

is said to stand high in the Emperor's confidence and esteem.



Baron Ungern-Sternberg, a boisterous, whole-souled old nobleman, came

with the rest.  He is a man of progress and enterprise--a representative

man of the age.  He is the Chief Director of the railway system of

Russia--a sort of railroad king.  In his line he is making things move

along in this country He has traveled extensively in America.  He says he

has tried convict labor on his railroads, and with perfect success.  He

says the convicts work well, and are quiet and peaceable.  He observed

that he employs nearly ten thousand of them now.



This appeared to be another call on my resources.  I was equal to the

emergency.  I said we had eighty thousand convicts employed on the

railways in America--all of them under sentence of death for murder in

the first degree.  That closed him out.



We had General Todtleben (the famous defender of Sebastopol, during the

siege,) and many inferior army and also navy officers, and a number of

unofficial Russian ladies and gentlemen.  Naturally, a champagne luncheon

was in order, and was accomplished without loss of life.  Toasts and

jokes were discharged freely, but no speeches were made save one thanking

the Emperor and the Grand Duke, through the Governor-General, for our

hospitable reception, and one by the Governor-General in reply, in which

he returned the Emperor's thanks for the speech, etc., etc.









CHAPTER XXXVIII.



We returned to Constantinople, and after a day or two spent in exhausting

marches about the city and voyages up the Golden Horn in caiques, we

steamed away again.  We passed through the Sea of Marmora and the

Dardanelles, and steered for a new land--a new one to us, at least--Asia.

We had as yet only acquired a bowing acquaintance with it, through

pleasure excursions to Scutari and the regions round about.



We passed between Lemnos and Mytilene, and saw them as we had seen Elba

and the Balearic Isles--mere bulky shapes, with the softening mists of

distance upon them--whales in a fog, as it were.  Then we held our course

southward, and began to "read up" celebrated Smyrna.



At all hours of the day and night the sailors in the forecastle amused

themselves and aggravated us by burlesquing our visit to royalty.  The

opening paragraph of our Address to the Emperor was framed as follows:



     "We are a handful of private citizens of America, traveling simply

     for recreation--and unostentatiously, as becomes our unofficial

     state--and, therefore, we have no excuse to tender for presenting

     ourselves before your Majesty, save the desire of offering our

     grateful acknowledgments to the lord of a realm, which, through good

     and through evil report, has been the steadfast friend of the land

     we love so well."



The third cook, crowned with a resplendent tin basin and wrapped royally

in a table-cloth mottled with grease-spots and coffee stains, and bearing

a sceptre that looked strangely like a belaying-pin, walked upon a

dilapidated carpet and perched himself on the capstan, careless of the

flying spray; his tarred and weather-beaten Chamberlains, Dukes and Lord

High Admirals surrounded him, arrayed in all the pomp that spare

tarpaulins and remnants of old sails could furnish.  Then the visiting

"watch below," transformed into graceless ladies and uncouth pilgrims, by

rude travesties upon waterfalls, hoopskirts, white kid gloves and

swallow-tail coats, moved solemnly up the companion way, and bowing low,

began a system of complicated and extraordinary smiling which few

monarchs could look upon and live.  Then the mock consul, a slush-

plastered deck-sweep, drew out a soiled fragment of paper and proceeded

to read, laboriously:



"To His Imperial Majesty, Alexander II., Emperor of Russia:



"We are a handful of private citizens of America, traveling simply for

recreation,--and unostentatiously, as becomes our unofficial state--and

therefore, we have no excuse to tender for presenting ourselves before

your Majesty--"



The Emperor--"Then what the devil did you come for?"



--"Save the desire of offering our grateful acknowledgments to the lord

of a realm which--"



The Emperor--" Oh, d--n the Address!--read it to the police.

Chamberlain, take these people over to my brother, the Grand Duke's, and

give them a square meal.  Adieu!  I am happy--I am gratified--I am

delighted--I am bored.  Adieu, adieu--vamos the ranch!  The First Groom

of the Palace will proceed to count the portable articles of value

belonging to the premises."



The farce then closed, to be repeated again with every change of the

watches, and embellished with new and still more extravagant inventions

of pomp and conversation.



At all times of the day and night the phraseology of that tiresome

address fell upon our ears.  Grimy sailors came down out of the foretop

placidly announcing themselves as "a handful of private citizens of

America, traveling simply for recreation and unostentatiously," etc.; the

coal passers moved to their duties in the profound depths of the ship,

explaining the blackness of their faces and their uncouthness of dress,

with the reminder that they were "a handful of private citizens,

traveling simply for recreation," etc., and when the cry rang through the

vessel at midnight: "EIGHT BELLS!--LARBOARD WATCH, TURN OUT!"  the

larboard watch came gaping and stretching out of their den, with the

everlasting formula: "Aye-aye, sir!  We are a handful of private citizens

of America, traveling simply for recreation, and unostentatiously, as

becomes our unofficial state!"



As I was a member of the committee, and helped to frame the Address,

these sarcasms came home to me.  I never heard a sailor proclaiming

himself as a handful of American citizens traveling for recreation, but I

wished he might trip and fall overboard, and so reduce his handful by one

individual, at least.  I never was so tired of any one phrase as the

sailors made me of the opening sentence of the Address to the Emperor of

Russia.



This seaport of Smyrna, our first notable acquaintance in Asia, is a

closely packed city of one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants, and,

like Constantinople, it has no outskirts.  It is as closely packed at its

outer edges as it is in the centre, and then the habitations leave

suddenly off and the plain beyond seems houseless.  It is just like any

other Oriental city.  That is to say, its Moslem houses are heavy and

dark, and as comfortless as so many tombs; its streets are crooked,

rudely and roughly paved, and as narrow as an ordinary staircase; the

streets uniformly carry a man to any other place than the one he wants to

go to, and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected localities;

business is chiefly carried on in great covered bazaars, celled like a

honeycomb with innumerable shops no larger than a common closet, and the

whole hive cut up into a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodate

a laden camel, and well calculated to confuse a stranger and eventually

lose him; every where there is dirt, every where there are fleas, every

where there are lean, broken-hearted dogs; every alley is thronged with

people; wherever you look, your eye rests upon a wild masquerade of

extravagant costumes; the workshops are all open to the streets, and the

workmen visible; all manner of sounds assail the ear, and over them all

rings out the muezzin's cry from some tall minaret, calling the faithful

vagabonds to prayer; and superior to the call to prayer, the noises in

the streets, the interest of the costumes--superior to every thing, and

claiming the bulk of attention first, last, and all the time--is a

combination of Mohammedan stenches, to which the smell of even a Chinese

quarter would be as pleasant as the roasting odors of the fatted calf to

the nostrils of the returning Prodigal.  Such is Oriental luxury--such is

Oriental splendor!  We read about it all our days, but we comprehend it

not until we see it.  Smyrna is a very old city.  Its name occurs several

times in the Bible, one or two of the disciples of Christ visited it, and

here was located one of the original seven apocalyptic churches spoken of

in Revelations.  These churches were symbolized in the Scriptures as

candlesticks, and on certain conditions there was a sort of implied

promise that Smyrna should be endowed with a "crown of life."  She was to

"be faithful unto death"--those were the terms.  She has not kept up her

faith straight along, but the pilgrims that wander hither consider that

she has come near enough to it to save her, and so they point to the fact

that Smyrna to-day wears her crown of life, and is a great city, with a

great commerce and full of energy, while the cities wherein were located

the other six churches, and to which no crown of life was promised, have

vanished from the earth.  So Smyrna really still possesses her crown of

life, in a business point of view.  Her career, for eighteen centuries,

has been a chequered one, and she has been under the rule of princes of

many creeds, yet there has been no season during all that time, as far as

we know, (and during such seasons as she was inhabited at all,) that she

has been without her little community of Christians "faithful unto

death."  Hers was the only church against which no threats were implied

in the Revelations, and the only one which survived.



With Ephesus, forty miles from here, where was located another of the

seven churches, the case was different.  The "candlestick" has been

removed from Ephesus.  Her light has been put out.  Pilgrims, always

prone to find prophecies in the Bible, and often where none exist, speak

cheerfully and complacently of poor, ruined Ephesus as the victim of

prophecy.  And yet there is no sentence that promises, without due

qualification, the destruction of the city.  The words are:



     "Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and

     do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will

     remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent."



That is all; the other verses are singularly complimentary to Ephesus.

The threat is qualified.  There is no history to show that she did not

repent.  But the cruelest habit the modern prophecy-savans have, is that

one of coolly and arbitrarily fitting the prophetic shirt on to the wrong

man.  They do it without regard to rhyme or reason.  Both the cases I

have just mentioned are instances in point.  Those "prophecies" are

distinctly leveled at the "churches of Ephesus, Smyrna," etc., and yet

the pilgrims invariably make them refer to the cities instead.  No crown

of life is promised to the town of Smyrna and its commerce, but to the

handful of Christians who formed its "church."  If they were "faithful

unto death," they have their crown now--but no amount of faithfulness and

legal shrewdness combined could legitimately drag the city into a

participation in the promises of the prophecy.  The stately language of

the Bible refers to a crown of life whose lustre will reflect the day-

beams of the endless ages of eternity, not the butterfly existence of a

city built by men's hands, which must pass to dust with the builders and

be forgotten even in the mere handful of centuries vouchsafed to the

solid world itself between its cradle and its grave.



The fashion of delving out fulfillments of prophecy where that prophecy

consists of mere "ifs," trenches upon the absurd.  Suppose, a thousand

years from now, a malarious swamp builds itself up in the shallow harbor

of Smyrna, or something else kills the town; and suppose, also, that

within that time the swamp that has filled the renowned harbor of Ephesus

and rendered her ancient site deadly and uninhabitable to-day, becomes

hard and healthy ground; suppose the natural consequence ensues, to wit:

that Smyrna becomes a melancholy ruin, and Ephesus is rebuilt.  What

would the prophecy-savans say?  They would coolly skip over our age of

the world, and say: "Smyrna was not faithful unto death, and so her crown

of life was denied her; Ephesus repented, and lo!  her candle-stick was

not removed.  Behold these evidences!  How wonderful is prophecy!"



Smyrna has been utterly destroyed six times.  If her crown of life had

been an insurance policy, she would have had an opportunity to collect on

it the first time she fell.  But she holds it on sufferance and by a

complimentary construction of language which does not refer to her.

Six different times, however, I suppose some infatuated prophecy-

enthusiast blundered along and said, to the infinite disgust of Smyrna

and the Smyrniotes: "In sooth, here is astounding fulfillment of

prophecy!  Smyrna hath not been faithful unto death, and behold her crown

of life is vanished from her head.  Verily, these things be astonishing!"



Such things have a bad influence.  They provoke worldly men into using

light conversation concerning sacred subjects.  Thick-headed commentators

upon the Bible, and stupid preachers and teachers, work more damage to

religion than sensible, cool-brained clergymen can fight away again, toil

as they may.  It is not good judgment to fit a crown of life upon a city

which has been destroyed six times.  That other class of wiseacres who

twist prophecy in such a manner as to make it promise the destruction and

desolation of the same city, use judgment just as bad, since the city is

in a very flourishing condition now, unhappily for them.  These things

put arguments into the mouth of infidelity.



A portion of the city is pretty exclusively Turkish; the Jews have a

quarter to themselves; the Franks another quarter; so, also, with the

Armenians.  The Armenians, of course, are Christians.  Their houses are

large, clean, airy, handsomely paved with black and white squares of

marble, and in the centre of many of them is a square court, which has in

it a luxuriant flower-garden and a sparkling fountain; the doors of all

the rooms open on this.  A very wide hall leads to the street door, and

in this the women sit, the most of the day.  In the cool of the evening

they dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door.

They are all comely of countenance, and exceedingly neat and cleanly;

they look as if they were just out of a band-box.  Some of the young

ladies--many of them, I may say--are even very beautiful; they average a

shade better than American girls--which treasonable words I pray may be

forgiven me.  They are very sociable, and will smile back when a stranger

smiles at them, bow back when he bows, and talk back if he speaks to

them.  No introduction is required.  An hour's chat at the door with a

pretty girl one never saw before, is easily obtained, and is very

pleasant.  I have tried it.  I could not talk anything but English, and

the girl knew nothing but Greek, or Armenian, or some such barbarous

tongue, but we got along very well.  I find that in cases like these, the

fact that you can not comprehend each other isn't much of a drawback.

In that Russia n town of Yalta I danced an astonishing sort of dance an

hour long, and one I had not heard of before, with a very pretty girl,

and we talked incessantly, and laughed exhaustingly, and neither one ever

knew what the other was driving at.  But it was splendid.  There were

twenty people in the set, and the dance was very lively and complicated.

It was complicated enough without me--with me it was more so.  I threw in

a figure now and then that surprised those Russians.  But I have never

ceased to think of that girl.  I have written to her, but I can not

direct the epistle because her name is one of those nine-jointed Russian

affairs, and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out.

I am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when I am awake, but I

make a stagger at it in my dreams, and get up with the lockjaw in the

morning.  I am fading.  I do not take my meals now, with any sort of

regularity.  Her dear name haunts me still in my dreams.  It is awful on

teeth.  It never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag along

with it.  And then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of the

last syllables--but they taste good.



Coming through the Dardanelles, we saw camel trains on shore with the

glasses, but we were never close to one till we got to Smyrna.  These

camels are very much larger than the scrawny specimens one sees in the

menagerie.  They stride along these streets, in single file, a dozen in a

train, with heavy loads on their backs, and a fancy-looking negro in

Turkish costume, or an Arab, preceding them on a little donkey and

completely overshadowed and rendered insignificant by the huge beasts.

To see a camel train laden with the spices of Arabia and the rare fabrics

of Persia come marching through the narrow alleys of the bazaar, among

porters with their burdens, money-changers, lamp-merchants, Al-naschars

in the glassware business, portly cross-legged Turks smoking the famous

narghili; and the crowds drifting to and fro in the fanciful costumes of

the East, is a genuine revelation of the Orient.  The picture lacks

nothing.  It casts you back at once into your forgotten boyhood, and

again you dream over the wonders of the Arabian Nights; again your

companions are princes, your lord is the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid, and

your servants are terrific giants and genii that come with smoke and

lightning and thunder, and go as a storm goes when they depart!









CHAPTER XXXIX.



We inquired, and learned that the lions of Smyrna consisted of the ruins

of the ancient citadel, whose broken and prodigious battlements frown

upon the city from a lofty hill just in the edge of the town--the Mount

Pagus of Scripture, they call it; the site of that one of the Seven

Apocalyptic Churches of Asia which was located here in the first century

of the Christian era; and the grave and the place of martyrdom of the

venerable Polycarp, who suffered in Smyrna for his religion some eighteen

hundred years ago.



We took little donkeys and started.  We saw Polycarp's tomb, and then

hurried on.



The "Seven Churches"--thus they abbreviate it--came next on the list.  We

rode there--about a mile and a half in the sweltering sun--and visited a

little Greek church which they said was built upon the ancient site; and

we paid a small fee, and the holy attendant gave each of us a little wax

candle as a remembrancer of the place, and I put mine in my hat and the

sun melted it and the grease all ran down the back of my neck; and so now

I have not any thing left but the wick, and it is a sorry and a wilted-

looking wick at that.



Several of us argued as well as we could that the "church" mentioned in

the Bible meant a party of Christians, and not a building; that the Bible

spoke of them as being very poor--so poor, I thought, and so subject to

persecution (as per Polycarp's martyrdom) that in the first place they

probably could not have afforded a church edifice, and in the second

would not have dared to build it in the open light of day if they could;

and finally, that if they had had the privilege of building it, common

judgment would have suggested that they build it somewhere near the town.

But the elders of the ship's family ruled us down and scouted our

evidences.  However, retribution came to them afterward.  They found that

they had been led astray and had gone to the wrong place; they discovered

that the accepted site is in the city.



Riding through the town, we could see marks of the six Smyrnas that have

existed here and been burned up by fire or knocked down by earthquakes.

The hills and the rocks are rent asunder in places, excavations expose

great blocks of building-stone that have lain buried for ages, and all

the mean houses and walls of modern Smyrna along the way are spotted

white with broken pillars, capitals and fragments of sculptured marble

that once adorned the lordly palaces that were the glory of the city in

the olden time.



The ascent of the hill of the citadel is very steep, and we proceeded

rather slowly.  But there were matters of interest about us.  In one

place, five hundred feet above the sea, the perpendicular bank on the

upper side of the road was ten or fifteen feet high, and the cut exposed

three veins of oyster shells, just as we have seen quartz veins exposed

in the cutting of a road in Nevada or Montana.  The veins were about

eighteen inches thick and two or three feet apart, and they slanted along

downward for a distance of thirty feet or more, and then disappeared

where the cut joined the road.  Heaven only knows how far a man might

trace them by "stripping."  They were clean, nice oyster shells, large,

and just like any other oyster shells.  They were thickly massed

together, and none were scattered above or below the veins.  Each one was

a well-defined lead by itself, and without a spur.  My first instinct was

to set up the usual--



                                 NOTICE:



     "We, the undersigned, claim five claims of two hundred feet each,

     (and one for discovery,) on this ledge or lode of oyster-shells,

     with all its dips, spurs, angles, variations and sinuosities, and

     fifty feet on each side of the same, to work it, etc., etc.,

     according to the mining laws of Smyrna."



They were such perfectly natural-looking leads that I could hardly keep

from "taking them up."  Among the oyster-shells were mixed many fragments

of ancient, broken crockery ware.  Now how did those masses of oyster-

shells get there?  I can not determine.  Broken crockery and oyster-

shells are suggestive of restaurants--but then they could have had no

such places away up there on that mountain side in our time, because

nobody has lived up there.  A restaurant would not pay in such a stony,

forbidding, desolate place.  And besides, there were no champagne corks

among the shells.  If there ever was a restaurant there, it must have

been in Smyrna's palmy days, when the hills were covered with palaces.

I could believe in one restaurant, on those terms; but then how about the

three?  Did they have restaurants there at three different periods of the

world?--because there are two or three feet of solid earth between the

oyster leads.  Evidently, the restaurant solution will not answer.



The hill might have been the bottom of the sea, once, and been lifted up,

with its oyster-beds, by an earthquake--but, then, how about the

crockery?  And moreover, how about three oyster beds, one above another,

and thick strata of good honest earth between?



That theory will not do.  It is just possible that this hill is Mount

Ararat, and that Noah's Ark rested here, and he ate oysters and threw the

shells overboard.  But that will not do, either.  There are the three

layers again and the solid earth between--and, besides, there were only

eight in Noah's family, and they could not have eaten all these oysters

in the two or three months they staid on top of that mountain.  The

beasts--however, it is simply absurd to suppose he did not know any more

than to feed the beasts on oyster suppers.



It is painful--it is even humiliating--but I am reduced at last to one

slender theory: that the oysters climbed up there of their own accord.

But what object could they have had in view?--what did they want up

there?  What could any oyster want to climb a hill for?  To climb a hill

must necessarily be fatiguing and annoying exercise for an oyster.  The

most natural conclusion would be that the oysters climbed up there to

look at the scenery.  Yet when one comes to reflect upon the nature of an

oyster, it seems plain that he does not care for scenery.  An oyster has

no taste for such things; he cares nothing for the beautiful.  An oyster

is of a retiring disposition, and not lively--not even cheerful above the

average, and never enterprising.  But above all, an oyster does not take

any interest in scenery--he scorns it.  What have I arrived at now?

Simply at the point I started from, namely, those oyster shells are

there, in regular layers, five hundred feet above the sea, and no man

knows how they got there.  I have hunted up the guide-books, and the gist

of what they say is this: "They are there, but how they got there is a

mystery."



Twenty-five years ago, a multitude of people in America put on their

ascension robes, took a tearful leave of their friends, and made ready to

fly up into heaven at the first blast of the trumpet.  But the angel did

not blow it.  Miller's resurrection day was a failure.  The Millerites

were disgusted.  I did not suspect that there were Millers in Asia Minor,

but a gentleman tells me that they had it all set for the world to come

to an end in Smyrna one day about three years ago.  There was much

buzzing and preparation for a long time previously, and it culminated in

a wild excitement at the appointed time.  A vast number of the populace

ascended the citadel hill early in the morning, to get out of the way of

the general destruction, and many of the infatuated closed up their shops

and retired from all earthly business.  But the strange part of it was

that about three in the afternoon, while this gentleman and his friends

were at dinner in the hotel, a terrific storm of rain, accompanied by

thunder and lightning, broke forth and continued with dire fury for two

or three hours.  It was a thing unprecedented in Smyrna at that time of

the year, and scared some of the most skeptical.  The streets ran rivers

and the hotel floor was flooded with water.  The dinner had to be

suspended.  When the storm finished and left every body drenched through

and through, and melancholy and half-drowned, the ascensionists came down

from the mountain as dry as so many charity-sermons!  They had been

looking down upon the fearful storm going on below, and really believed

that their proposed destruction of the world was proving a grand success.



A railway here in Asia--in the dreamy realm of the Orient--in the fabled

land of the Arabian Nights--is a strange thing to think of.  And yet they

have one already, and are building another.  The present one is well

built and well conducted, by an English Company, but is not doing an

immense amount of business.  The first year it carried a good many

passengers, but its freight list only comprised eight hundred pounds of

figs!



It runs almost to the very gates of Ephesus--a town great in all ages of

the world--a city familiar to readers of the Bible, and one which was as

old as the very hills when the disciples of Christ preached in its

streets.  It dates back to the shadowy ages of tradition, and was the

birthplace of gods renowned in Grecian mythology.  The idea of a

locomotive tearing through such a place as this, and waking the phantoms

of its old days of romance out of their dreams of dead and gone

centuries, is curious enough.



We journey thither tomorrow to see the celebrated ruins.









CHAPTER XL.



This has been a stirring day.  The Superintendent of the railway put a

train at our disposal, and did us the further kindness of accompanying us

to Ephesus and giving to us his watchful care.  We brought sixty scarcely

perceptible donkeys in the freight cars, for we had much ground to go

over.  We have seen some of the most grotesque costumes, along the line

of the railroad, that can be imagined.  I am glad that no possible

combination of words could describe them, for I might then be foolish

enough to attempt it.



At ancient Ayassalook, in the midst of a forbidding desert, we came upon

long lines of ruined aqueducts, and other remnants of architectural

grandeur, that told us plainly enough we were nearing what had been a

metropolis, once.  We left the train and mounted the donkeys, along with

our invited guests--pleasant young gentlemen from the officers' list of

an American man-of-war.



The little donkeys had saddles upon them which were made very high in

order that the rider's feet might not drag the ground.  The preventative

did not work well in the cases of our tallest pilgrims, however.  There

were no bridles--nothing but a single rope, tied to the bit.  It was

purely ornamental, for the donkey cared nothing for it.  If he were

drifting to starboard, you might put your helm down hard the other way,

if it were any satisfaction to you to do it, but he would continue to

drift to starboard all the same.  There was only one process which could

be depended on, and it was to get down and lift his rear around until his

head pointed in the right direction, or take him under your arm and carry

him to a part of the road which he could not get out of without climbing.

The sun flamed down as hot as a furnace, and neck-scarfs, veils and

umbrellas seemed hardly any protection; they served only to make the long

procession look more than ever fantastic--for be it known the ladies were

all riding astride because they could not stay on the shapeless saddles

sidewise, the men were perspiring and out of temper, their feet were

banging against the rocks, the donkeys were capering in every direction

but the right one and being belabored with clubs for it, and every now

and then a broad umbrella would suddenly go down out of the cavalcade,

announcing to all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust.  It was a

wilder picture than those solitudes had seen for many a day.  No donkeys

ever existed that were as hard to navigate as these, I think, or that had

so many vile, exasperating instincts.  Occasionally we grew so tired and

breathless with fighting them that we had to desist,--and immediately the

donkey would come down to a deliberate walk.  This, with the fatigue, and

the sun, would put a man asleep; and soon as the man was asleep, the

donkey would lie down.  My donkey shall never see his boyhood's home

again.  He has lain down once too often. He must die.



We all stood in the vast theatre of ancient Ephesus,--the stone-benched

amphitheatre I mean--and had our picture taken.  We looked as proper

there as we would look any where, I suppose.  We do not embellish the

general desolation of a desert much.  We add what dignity we can to a

stately ruin with our green umbrellas and jackasses, but it is little.

However, we mean well.



I wish to say a brief word of the aspect of Ephesus.



On a high, steep hill, toward the sea, is a gray ruin of ponderous blocks

of marble, wherein, tradition says, St. Paul was imprisoned eighteen

centuries ago.  From these old walls you have the finest view of the

desolate scene where once stood Ephesus, the proudest city of ancient

times, and whose Temple of Diana was so noble in design, and so exquisite

of workmanship, that it ranked high in the list of the Seven Wonders of

the World.



Behind you is the sea; in front is a level green valley, (a marsh, in

fact,) extending far away among the mountains; to the right of the front

view is the old citadel of Ayassalook, on a high hill; the ruined Mosque

of the Sultan Selim stands near it in the plain, (this is built over the

grave of St. John, and was formerly Christian Church ;) further toward

you is the hill of Pion, around whose front is clustered all that remains

of the ruins of Ephesus that still stand; divided from it by a narrow

valley is the long, rocky, rugged mountain of Coressus.  The scene is a

pretty one, and yet desolate--for in that wide plain no man can live, and

in it is no human habitation.  But for the crumbling arches and monstrous

piers and broken walls that rise from the foot of the hill of Pion, one

could not believe that in this place once stood a city whose renown is

older than tradition itself.  It is incredible to reflect that things as

familiar all over the world to-day as household words, belong in the

history and in the shadowy legends of this silent, mournful solitude.

We speak of Apollo and of Diana--they were born here; of the

metamorphosis of Syrinx into a reed--it was done here; of the great god

Pan--he dwelt in the caves of this hill of Coressus; of the Amazons--this

was their best prized home; of Bacchus and Hercules both fought the

warlike women here; of the Cyclops--they laid the ponderous marble blocks

of some of the ruins yonder; of Homer--this was one of his many

birthplaces; of Cirmon of Athens; of Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus--

they visited here; so did Alexander the Great; so did Hannibal and

Antiochus, Scipio, Lucullus and Sylla; Brutus, Cassius, Pompey, Cicero,

and Augustus; Antony was a judge in this place, and left his seat in the

open court, while the advocates were speaking, to run after Cleopatra,

who passed the door; from this city these two sailed on pleasure

excursions, in galleys with silver oars and perfumed sails, and with

companies of beautiful girls to serve them, and actors and musicians to

amuse them; in days that seem almost modern, so remote are they from the

early history of this city, Paul the Apostle preached the new religion

here, and so did John, and here it is supposed the former was pitted

against wild beasts, for in 1 Corinthians, xv. 32 he says:



     "If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,"

     &c.,



when many men still lived who had seen the Christ; here Mary Magdalen

died, and here the Virgin Mary ended her days with John, albeit Rome has

since judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere; six or seven hundred

years ago--almost yesterday, as it were--troops of mail-clad Crusaders

thronged the streets; and to come down to trifles, we speak of meandering

streams, and find a new interest in a common word when we discover that

the crooked river Meander, in yonder valley, gave it to our dictionary.

It makes me feel as old as these dreary hills to look down upon these

moss-hung ruins, this historic desolation.  One may read the Scriptures

and believe, but he can not go and stand yonder in the ruined theatre and

in imagination people it again with the vanished multitudes who mobbed

Paul's comrades there and shouted, with one voice, "Great is Diana of the

Ephesians!"  The idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makes

one shudder.



It was a wonderful city, this Ephesus.  Go where you will about these

broad plains, you find the most exquisitely sculptured marble fragments

scattered thick among the dust and weeds; and protruding from the ground,

or lying prone upon it, are beautiful fluted columns of porphyry and all

precious marbles; and at every step you find elegantly carved capitals

and massive bases, and polished tablets engraved with Greek inscriptions.

It is a world of precious relics, a wilderness of marred and mutilated

gems.  And yet what are these things to the wonders that lie buried here

under the ground?  At Constantinople, at Pisa, in the cities of Spain,

are great mosques and cathedrals, whose grandest columns came from the

temples and palaces of Ephesus, and yet one has only to scratch the

ground here to match them.  We shall never know what magnificence is,

until this imperial city is laid bare to the sun.



The finest piece of sculpture we have yet seen and the one that impressed

us most, (for we do not know much about art and can not easily work up

ourselves into ecstasies over it,) is one that lies in this old theatre

of Ephesus which St. Paul's riot has made so celebrated.  It is only the

headless body of a man, clad in a coat of mail, with a Medusa head upon

the breast-plate, but we feel persuaded that such dignity and such

majesty were never thrown into a form of stone before.



What builders they were, these men of antiquity!  The massive arches of

some of these ruins rest upon piers that are fifteen feet square and

built entirely of solid blocks of marble, some of which are as large as a

Saratoga trunk, and some the size of a boarding-house sofa.  They are not

shells or shafts of stone filled inside with rubbish, but the whole pier

is a mass of solid masonry.  Vast arches, that may have been the gates of

the city, are built in the same way.  They have braved the storms and

sieges of three thousand years, and have been shaken by many an

earthquake, but still they stand.  When they dig alongside of them, they

find ranges of ponderous masonry that are as perfect in every detail as

they were the day those old Cyclopian giants finished them.  An English

Company is going to excavate Ephesus--and then!



And now am I reminded of--



                    THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.



In the Mount of Pion, yonder, is the Cave of the Seven Sleepers.  Once

upon a time, about fifteen hundred years ago, seven young men lived near

each other in Ephesus, who belonged to the despised sect of the

Christians.  It came to pass that the good King Maximilianus, (I am

telling this story for nice little boys and girls,) it came to pass, I

say, that the good King Maximilianus fell to persecuting the Christians,

and as time rolled on he made it very warm for them.  So the seven young

men said one to the other, let us get up and travel.  And they got up and

traveled.  They tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers good-bye, or

any friend they knew.  They only took certain moneys which their parents

had, and garments that belonged unto their friends, whereby they might

remember them when far away; and they took also the dog Ketmehr, which

was the property of their neighbor Malchus, because the beast did run his

head into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly, and

they had not time to release him; and they took also certain chickens

that seemed lonely in the neighboring coops, and likewise some bottles of

curious liquors that stood near the grocer's window; and then they

departed from the city.  By-and-by they came to a marvelous cave in the

Hill of Pion and entered into it and feasted, and presently they hurried

on again.  But they forgot the bottles of curious liquors, and left them

behind.  They traveled in many lands, and had many strange adventures.

They were virtuous young men, and lost no opportunity that fell in their

way to make their livelihood.  Their motto was in these words, namely,

"Procrastination is the thief of time."  And so, whenever they did come

upon a man who was alone, they said, Behold, this person hath the

wherewithal--let us go through him.  And they went through him.  At the

end of five years they had waxed tired of travel and adventure, and

longed to revisit their old home again and hear the voices and see the

faces that were dear unto their youth.  Therefore they went through such

parties as fell in their way where they sojourned at that time, and

journeyed back toward Ephesus again.  For the good King Maximilianus was

become converted unto the new faith, and the Christians rejoiced because

they were no longer persecuted.  One day as the sun went down, they came

to the cave in the Mount of Pion, and they said, each to his fellow, Let

us sleep here, and go and feast and make merry with our friends when the

morning cometh.  And each of the seven lifted up his voice and said, It

is a whiz.  So they went in, and lo, where they had put them, there lay

the bottles of strange liquors, and they judged that age had not impaired

their excellence.  Wherein the wanderers were right, and the heads of the

same were level.  So each of the young men drank six bottles, and behold

they felt very tired, then, and lay down and slept soundly.



When they awoke, one of them, Johannes--surnamed Smithianus--said, We are

naked.  And it was so.  Their raiment was all gone, and the money which

they had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceeded through as they

approached the city, was lying upon the ground, corroded and rusted and

defaced.  Likewise the dog Ketmehr was gone, and nothing save the brass

that was upon his collar remained.  They wondered much at these things.

But they took the money, and they wrapped about their bodies some leaves,

and came up to the top of the hill.  Then were they perplexed.  The

wonderful temple of Diana was gone; many grand edifices they had never

seen before stood in the city; men in strange garbs moved about the

streets, and every thing was changed.



Johannes said, It hardly seems like Ephesus.  Yet here is the great

gymnasium; here is the mighty theatre, wherein I have seen seventy

thousand men assembled; here is the Agora; there is the font where the

sainted John the Baptist immersed the converts; yonder is the prison of

the good St. Paul, where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chains

that bound him and be cured of our distempers; I see the tomb of the

disciple Luke, and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of the

holy John, where the Christians of Ephesus go twice a year to gather the

dust from the tomb, which is able to make bodies whole again that are

corrupted by disease, and cleanse the soul from sin; but see how the

wharves encroach upon the sea, and what multitudes of ships are anchored

in the bay; see, also, how the city hath stretched abroad, far over the

valley behind Pion, and even unto the walls of Ayassalook; and lo, all

the hills are white with palaces and ribbed with colonnades of marble.

How mighty is Ephesus become!



And wondering at what their eyes had seen, they went down into the city

and purchased garments and clothed themselves.  And when they would have

passed on, the merchant bit the coins which they had given him, with his

teeth, and turned them about and looked curiously upon them, and cast

them upon his counter, and listened if they rang; and then he said, These

be bogus.  And they said, Depart thou to Hades, and went their way.  When

they were come to their houses, they recognized them, albeit they seemed

old and mean; and they rejoiced, and were glad.  They ran to the doors,

and knocked, and strangers opened, and looked inquiringly upon them.  And

they said, with great excitement, while their hearts beat high, and the

color in their faces came and went, Where is my father?  Where is my

mother?  Where are Dionysius and Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius?  And

the strangers that opened said, We know not these.  The Seven said, How,

you know them not?  How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are they

gone that dwelt here before ye?  And the strangers said, Ye play upon us

with a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under these

roofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs, and

they that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and sung,

have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them, and are

at rest; for nine-score years the summers have come and gone, and the

autumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded out of their cheeks and

they laid them to sleep with the dead.



Then the seven young men turned them away from their homes, and the

strangers shut the doors upon them.  The wanderers marveled greatly, and

looked into the faces of all they met, as hoping to find one that they

knew; but all were strange, and passed them by and spake no friendly

word.  They were sore distressed and sad.  Presently they spake unto a

citizen and said, Who is King in Ephesus?  And the citizen answered and

said, Whence come ye that ye know not that great Laertius reigns in

Ephesus?  They looked one at the other, greatly perplexed, and presently

asked again, Where, then, is the good King Maximilianus?  The citizen

moved him apart, as one who is afraid, and said, Verily these men be mad,

and dream dreams, else would they know that the King whereof they speak

is dead above two hundred years agone.



Then the scales fell from the eyes of the Seven, and one said, Alas, that

we drank of the curious liquors.  They have made us weary, and in

dreamless sleep these two long centuries have we lain.  Our homes are

desolate, our friends are dead.  Behold, the jig is up--let us die.  And

that same day went they forth and laid them down and died.  And in that

self-same day, likewise, the Seven-up did cease in Ephesus, for that the

Seven that were up were down again, and departed and dead withal.  And

the names that be upon their tombs, even unto this time, are Johannes

Smithianus, Trumps, Gift, High, and Low, Jack, and The Game.  And with

the sleepers lie also the bottles wherein were once the curious liquors:

and upon them is writ, in ancient letters, such words as these--Dames of

heathen gods of olden time, perchance: Rumpunch, Jinsling, Egnog.



Such is the story of the Seven Sleepers, (with slight variations,) and I

know it is true, because I have seen the cave myself.



Really, so firm a faith had the ancients this legend, that as late as

eight or nine hundred years ago, learned travelers held it in

superstitious fear.  Two of them record that they ventured into it, but

ran quickly out again, not daring to tarry lest they should fall asleep

and outlive their great grand-children a century or so.  Even at this day

the ignorant denizens of the neighboring country prefer not to sleep in

it.









CHAPTER XLI.



When I last made a memorandum, we were at Ephesus.  We are in Syria, now,

encamped in the mountains of Lebanon.  The interregnum has been long,

both as to time and distance.  We brought not a relic from Ephesus!

After gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments

from the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a cost

of infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway

depot, a government officer compelled all who had such things to

disgorge!  He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party,

and see that we carried nothing off.  It was a wise, a just, and a well-

deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation.  I never resist a temptation

to plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferably vain about

it.  This time I felt proud beyond expression.  I was serene in the midst

of the scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman government for its

affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely respectable gentlemen

and ladies I said, "We that have free souls, it touches us not."  The

shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinched hard; a principal

sufferer discovered that the imperial order was inclosed in an envelop

bearing the seal of the British Embassy at Constantinople, and therefore

must have been inspired by the representative of the Queen.  This was

bad--very bad.  Coming solely from the Ottomans, it might have signified

only Ottoman hatred of Christians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel

methods of expressing it; but coming from the Christianized, educated,

politic British legation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of

gentlemen and ladies who would bear watching!  So the party regarded it,

and were incensed accordingly.  The truth doubtless was, that the same

precautions would have been taken against any travelers, because the

English Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and have

paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserve to be.

They can not afford to run the risk of having their hospitality abused by

travelers, especially since travelers are such notorious scorners of

honest behavior.



We sailed from Smyrna, in the wildest spirit of expectancy, for the chief

feature, the grand goal of the expedition, was near at hand--we were

approaching the Holy Land!  Such a burrowing into the hold for trunks

that had lain buried for weeks, yes for months; such a hurrying to and

fro above decks and below; such a riotous system of packing and

unpacking; such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and skirts, and

indescribable and unclassable odds and ends; such a making up of bundles,

and setting apart of umbrellas, green spectacles and thick veils; such a

critical inspection of saddles and bridles that had never yet touched

horses; such a cleaning and loading of revolvers and examining of bowie-

knives; such a half-soling of the seats of pantaloons with serviceable

buckskin; then such a poring over ancient maps; such a reading up of

Bibles and Palestine travels; such a marking out of routes; such

exasperating efforts to divide up the company into little bands of

congenial spirits who might make the long and arduous Journey without

quarreling; and morning, noon and night, such mass-meetings in the

cabins, such speech-making, such sage suggesting, such worrying and

quarreling, and such a general raising of the very mischief, was never

seen in the ship before!



But it is all over now.  We are cut up into parties of six or eight, and

by this time are scattered far and wide.  Ours is the only one, however,

that is venturing on what is called "the long trip"--that is, out into

Syria, by Baalbec to Damascus, and thence down through the full length of

Palestine.  It would be a tedious, and also a too risky journey, at this

hot season of the year, for any but strong, healthy men, accustomed

somewhat to fatigue and rough life in the open air.  The other parties

will take shorter journeys.



For the last two months we have been in a worry about one portion of this

Holy Land pilgrimage.  I refer to transportation service.  We knew very

well that Palestine was a country which did not do a large passenger

business, and every man we came across who knew any thing about it gave

us to understand that not half of our party would be able to get dragomen

and animals.  At Constantinople every body fell to telegraphing the

American Consuls at Alexandria and Beirout to give notice that we wanted

dragomen and transportation.  We were desperate--would take horses,

jackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos--any thing.  At Smyrna, more

telegraphing was done, to the same end.  Also fearing for the worst, we

telegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for Damascus,

and horses for the ruins of Baalbec.



As might have been expected, a notion got abroad in Syria and Egypt that

the whole population of the Province of America (the Turks consider us a

trifling little province in some unvisited corner of the world,) were

coming to the Holy Land--and so, when we got to Beirout yesterday, we

found the place full of dragomen and their outfits.  We had all intended

to go by diligence to Damascus, and switch off to Baalbec as we went

along--because we expected to rejoin the ship, go to Mount Carmel, and

take to the woods from there.  However, when our own private party of

eight found that it was possible, and proper enough, to make the "long

trip," we adopted that programme.  We have never been much trouble to a

Consul before, but we have been a fearful nuisance to our Consul at

Beirout.  I mention this because I can not help admiring his patience,

his industry, and his accommodating spirit.  I mention it also, because I

think some of our ship's company did not give him as full credit for his

excellent services as he deserved.



Well, out of our eight, three were selected to attend to all business

connected with the expedition.  The rest of us had nothing to do but look

at the beautiful city of Beirout, with its bright, new houses nestled

among a wilderness of green shrubbery spread abroad over an upland that

sloped gently down to the sea; and also at the mountains of Lebanon that

environ it; and likewise to bathe in the transparent blue water that

rolled its billows about the ship (we did not know there were sharks

there.) We had also to range up and down through the town and look at the

costumes.  These are picturesque and fanciful, but not so varied as at

Constantinople and Smyrna; the women of Beirout add an agony--in the two

former cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through (and

they often expose their ancles,) but at Beirout they cover their entire

faces with dark-colored or black veils, so that they look like mummies,

and then expose their breasts to the public.  A young gentleman (I

believe he was a Greek,) volunteered to show us around the city, and said

it would afford him great pleasure, because he was studying English and

wanted practice in that language.  When we had finished the rounds,

however, he called for remuneration--said he hoped the gentlemen would

give him a trifle in the way of a few piastres (equivalent to a few five

cent pieces.)  We did so.  The Consul was surprised when he heard it, and

said he knew the young fellow's family very well, and that they were an

old and highly respectable family and worth a hundred and fifty thousand

dollars!  Some people, so situated, would have been ashamed of the berth

he had with us and his manner of crawling into it.



At the appointed time our business committee reported, and said all

things were in readdress--that we were to start to-day, with horses, pack

animals, and tents, and go to Baalbec, Damascus, the Sea of Tiberias, and

thence southward by the way of the scene of Jacob's Dream and other

notable Bible localities to Jerusalem--from thence probably to the Dead

Sea, but possibly not--and then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship

three or four weeks hence at Joppa; terms, five dollars a day apiece, in

gold, and every thing to be furnished by the dragoman.  They said we

would lie as well as at a hotel.  I had read something like that before,

and did not shame my judgment by believing a word of it.  I said nothing,

however, but packed up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in, pipes and

tobacco, two or three woollen shirts, a portfolio, a guide-book, and a

Bible.  I also took along a towel and a cake of soap, to inspire respect

in the Arabs, who would take me for a king in disguise.



We were to select our horses at 3 P.M.  At that hour Abraham, the

dragoman, marshaled them before us.  With all solemnity I set it down

here, that those horses were the hardest lot I ever did come across, and

their accoutrements were in exquisite keeping with their style.  One

brute had an eye out; another had his tail sawed off close, like a

rabbit, and was proud of it; another had a bony ridge running from his

neck to his tail, like one of those ruined aqueducts one sees about Rome,

and had a neck on him like a bowsprit; they all limped, and had sore

backs, and likewise raw places and old scales scattered about their

persons like brass nails in a hair trunk; their gaits were marvelous to

contemplate, and replete with variety under way the procession looked

like a fleet in a storm.  It was fearful.  Blucher shook his head and

said:



"That dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching these old

crates out of the hospital the way they are, unless he has got a permit."



I said nothing.  The display was exactly according to the guide-book, and

were we not traveling by the guide-book?  I selected a certain horse

because I thought I saw him shy, and I thought that a horse that had

spirit enough to shy was not to be despised.



At 6 o'clock P.M., we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of a

shapely mountain overlooking the sea, and the handsome valley where dwelt

some of those enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so much

about; all around us are what were once the dominions of Hiram, King of

Tyre, who furnished timber from the cedars of these Lebanon hills to

build portions of King Solomon's Temple with.



Shortly after six, our pack train arrived.  I had not seen it before, and

a good right I had to be astonished.  We had nineteen serving men and

twenty-six pack mules!  It was a perfect caravan.  It looked like one,

too, as it wound among the rocks.  I wondered what in the very mischief

we wanted with such a vast turn-out as that, for eight men.  I wondered

awhile, but soon I began to long for a tin plate, and some bacon and

beans.  I had camped out many and many a time before, and knew just what

was coming.  I went off, without waiting for serving men, and unsaddled

my horse, and washed such portions of his ribs and his spine as projected

through his hide, and when I came back, behold five stately circus tents

were up--tents that were brilliant, within, with blue, and gold, and

crimson, and all manner of splendid adornment!  I was speechless.  Then

they brought eight little iron bedsteads, and set them up in the tents;

they put a soft mattress and pillows and good blankets and two snow-white

sheets on each bed.  Next, they rigged a table about the centre-pole, and

on it placed pewter pitchers, basins, soap, and the whitest of towels--

one set for each man; they pointed to pockets in the tent, and said we

could put our small trifles in them for convenience, and if we needed

pins or such things, they were sticking every where.  Then came the

finishing touch--they spread carpets on the floor!  I simply said, "If

you call this camping out, all right--but it isn't the style I am used

to; my little baggage that I brought along is at a discount."



It grew dark, and they put candles on the tables--candles set in bright,

new, brazen candlesticks.  And soon the bell--a genuine, simon-pure bell

--rang, and we were invited to "the saloon."  I had thought before that

we had a tent or so too many, but now here was one, at least, provided

for; it was to be used for nothing but an eating-saloon.  Like the

others, it was high enough for a family of giraffes to live in, and was

very handsome and clean and bright-colored within.  It was a gem of a

place.  A table for eight, and eight canvas chairs; a table-cloth and

napkins whose whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things we

were used to in the great excursion steamer; knives and forks, soup-

plates, dinner-plates--every thing, in the handsomest kind of style.  It

was wonderful!  And they call this camping out.  Those stately fellows in

baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in a dinner which consisted of

roast mutton, roast chicken, roast goose, potatoes, bread, tea, pudding,

apples, and delicious grapes; the viands were better cooked than any we

had eaten for weeks, and the table made a finer appearance, with its

large German silver candlesticks and other finery, than any table we had

sat down to for a good while, and yet that polite dragoman, Abraham, came

bowing in and apologizing for the whole affair, on account of the

unavoidable confusion of getting under way for a very long trip, and

promising to do a great deal better in future!



It is midnight, now, and we break camp at six in the morning.



They call this camping out.  At this rate it is a glorious privilege to

be a pilgrim to the Holy Land.









CHAPTER XLII.



We are camped near Temnin-el-Foka--a name which the boys have simplified

a good deal, for the sake of convenience in spelling.  They call it

Jacksonville.  It sounds a little strangely, here in the Valley of

Lebanon, but it has the merit of being easier to remember than the Arabic

name.



                     "COME LIKE SPIRITS, SO DEPART."



                 "The night shall be filled with music,

                   And the cares that infest the day

                 Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,

                      And as silently steal away."



I slept very soundly last night, yet when the dragoman's bell rang at

half-past five this morning and the cry went abroad of "Ten minutes to

dress for breakfast!"  I heard both.  It surprised me, because I have not

heard the breakfast gong in the ship for a month, and whenever we have

had occasion to fire a salute at daylight, I have only found it out in

the course of conversation afterward.  However, camping out, even though

it be in a gorgeous tent, makes one fresh and lively in the morning--

especially if the air you are breathing is the cool, fresh air of the

mountains.



I was dressed within the ten minutes, and came out.  The saloon tent had

been stripped of its sides, and had nothing left but its roof; so when we

sat down to table we could look out over a noble panorama of mountain,

sea and hazy valley.  And sitting thus, the sun rose slowly up and

suffused the picture with a world of rich coloring.



Hot mutton chops, fried chicken, omelettes, fried potatoes and coffee--

all excellent.  This was the bill of fare.  It was sauced with a savage

appetite purchased by hard riding the day before, and refreshing sleep in

a pure atmosphere.  As I called for a second cup of coffee, I glanced

over my shoulder, and behold our white village was gone--the splendid

tents had vanished like magic!  It was wonderful how quickly those Arabs

had "folded their tents;" and it was wonderful, also, how quickly they

had gathered the thousand odds and ends of the camp together and

disappeared with them.



By half-past six we were under way, and all the Syrian world seemed to be

under way also.  The road was filled with mule trains and long

processions of camels.  This reminds me that we have been trying for some

time to think what a camel looks like, and now we have made it out.  When

he is down on all his knees, flat on his breast to receive his load, he

looks something like a goose swimming; and when he is upright he looks

like an ostrich with an extra set of legs.  Camels are not beautiful, and

their long under lip gives them an exceedingly "gallus"--[Excuse the

slang, no other word will describe it]--expression.  They have immense,

flat, forked cushions of feet, that make a track in the dust like a pie

with a slice cut out of it.  They are not particular about their diet.

They would eat a tombstone if they could bite it.  A thistle grows about

here which has needles on it that would pierce through leather, I think;

if one touches you, you can find relief in nothing but profanity.  The

camels eat these.  They show by their actions that they enjoy them.  I

suppose it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nails for

supper.



While I am speaking of animals, I will mention that I have a horse now by

the name of "Jericho."  He is a mare.  I have seen remarkable horses

before, but none so remarkable as this.  I wanted a horse that could shy,

and this one fills the bill.  I had an idea that shying indicated spirit.

If I was correct, I have got the most spirited horse on earth.  He shies

at every thing he comes across, with the utmost impartiality.  He appears

to have a mortal dread of telegraph poles, especially; and it is

fortunate that these are on both sides of the road, because as it is now,

I never fall off twice in succession on the same side.  If I fell on the

same side always, it would get to be monotonous after a while.  This

creature has scared at every thing he has seen to-day, except a haystack.

He walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that were

astonishing.  And it would fill any one with admiration to see how he

preserves his self-possession in the presence of a barley sack.  This

dare-devil bravery will be the death of this horse some day.



He is not particularly fast, but I think he will get me through the Holy

Land.  He has only one fault.  His tail has been chopped off or else he

has sat down on it too hard, some time or other, and he has to fight the

flies with his heels.  This is all very well, but when he tries to kick a

fly off the top of his head with his hind foot, it is too much variety.

He is going to get himself into trouble that way some day.  He reaches

around and bites my legs too.  I do not care particularly about that,

only I do not like to see a horse too sociable.



I think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him.  He had an

idea that he was one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not of

that character.  I know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought

the horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle

and shouting in Arabic, "Ho!  will you?  Do you want to run away, you

ferocious beast, and break your neck?" when all the time the horse was

not doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to lean

up against something and think.  Whenever he is not shying at things, or

reaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet.  How it would surprise his

owner to know this.



We have been in a historical section of country all day.  At noon we

camped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh, near the junction of the

Lebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh, and looked down into the

immense, level, garden-like Valley of Lebanon.  To-night we are camping

near the same valley, and have a very wide sweep of it in view.  We can

see the long, whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above the

eastern hills.  The "dews of Hermon" are falling upon us now, and the

tents are almost soaked with them.



Over the way from us, and higher up the valley, we can discern, through

the glasses, the faint outlines of the wonderful ruins of Baalbec, the

supposed Baal-Gad of Scripture.  Joshua, and another person, were the two

spies who were sent into this land of Canaan by the children of Israel to

report upon its character--I mean they were the spies who reported

favorably.  They took back with them some specimens of the grapes of this

country, and in the children's picture-books they are always represented

as bearing one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them, a

respectable load for a pack-train.  The Sunday-school books exaggerated

it a little.  The grapes are most excellent to this day, but the bunches

are not as large as those in the pictures.  I was surprised and hurt when

I saw them, because those colossal bunches of grapes were one of my most

cherished juvenile traditions.



Joshua reported favorably, and the children of Israel journeyed on, with

Moses at the head of the general government, and Joshua in command of the

army of six hundred thousand fighting men.  Of women and children and

civilians there was a countless swarm.  Of all that mighty host, none but

the two faithful spies ever lived to set their feet in the Promised Land.

They and their descendants wandered forty years in the desert, and then

Moses, the gifted warrior, poet, statesman and philosopher, went up into

Pisgah and met his mysterious fate.  Where he was buried no man knows--

for



          "* * * no man dug that sepulchre,

          And no man saw it e'er--

          For the Sons of God upturned the sod

          And laid the dead man there!"



Then Joshua began his terrible raid, and from Jericho clear to this Baal-

Gad, he swept the land like the Genius of Destruction.  He slaughtered

the people, laid waste their soil, and razed their cities to the ground.

He wasted thirty-one kings also.  One may call it that, though really it

can hardly be called wasting them, because there were always plenty of

kings in those days, and to spare.  At any rate, he destroyed thirty-one

kings, and divided up their realms among his Israelites.  He divided up

this valley stretched out here before us, and so it was once Jewish

territory.  The Jews have long since disappeared from it, however.



Back yonder, an hour's journey from here, we passed through an Arab

village of stone dry-goods boxes (they look like that,) where Noah's tomb

lies under lock and key.  [Noah built the ark.]  Over these old hills and

valleys the ark that contained all that was left of a vanished world once

floated.



I make no apology for detailing the above information.  It will be news

to some of my readers, at any rate.



Noah's tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone building.

Bucksheesh let us in.  The building had to be long, because the grave of

the honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long itself!  It is

only about four feet high, though.  He must have cast a shadow like a

lightning-rod.  The proof that this is the genuine spot where Noah was

buried can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous people.  The

evidence is pretty straight.  Shem, the son of Noah, was present at the

burial, and showed the place to his descendants, who transmitted the

knowledge to their descendants, and the lineal descendants of these

introduced themselves to us to-day.  It was pleasant to make the

acquaintance of members of so respectable a family.  It was a thing to be

proud of.  It was the next thing to being acquainted with Noah himself.



Noah's memorable voyage will always possess a living interest for me,

henceforward.



If ever an oppressed race existed, it is this one we see fettered around

us under the inhuman tyranny of the Ottoman Empire.  I wish Europe would

let Russia annihilate Turkey a little--not much, but enough to make it

difficult to find the place again without a divining-rod or a diving-

bell.  The Syrians are very poor, and yet they are ground down by a

system of taxation that would drive any other nation frantic.  Last year

their taxes were heavy enough, in all conscience--but this year they have

been increased by the addition of taxes that were forgiven them in times

of famine in former years.  On top of this the Government has levied a

tax of one-tenth of the whole proceeds of the land.  This is only half

the story.  The Pacha of a Pachalic does not trouble himself with

appointing tax-collectors.  He figures up what all these taxes ought to

amount to in a certain district.  Then he farms the collection out.  He

calls the rich men together, the highest bidder gets the speculation,

pays the Pacha on the spot, and then sells out to smaller fry, who sell

in turn to a piratical horde of still smaller fry.  These latter compel

the peasant to bring his little trifle of grain to the village, at his

own cost.  It must be weighed, the various taxes set apart, and the

remainder returned to the producer.  But the collector delays this duty

day after day, while the producer's family are perishing for bread; at

last the poor wretch, who can not but understand the game, says, "Take a

quarter--take half--take two-thirds if you will, and let me go!"  It is a

most outrageous state of things.



These people are naturally good-hearted and intelligent, and with

education and liberty, would be a happy and contented race.  They often

appeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day come

to their relief and save them.  The Sultan has been lavishing money like

water in England and Paris, but his subjects are suffering for it now.



This fashion of camping out bewilders me.  We have boot-jacks and a bath-

tub, now, and yet all the mysteries the pack-mules carry are not

revealed.  What next?









CHAPTER XLIII.



We had a tedious ride of about five hours, in the sun, across the Valley

of Lebanon.  It proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it had

seemed from the hill-sides.  It was a desert, weed-grown waste, littered

thickly with stones the size of a man's fist.  Here and there the natives

had scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain, but for the

most part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds, whose flocks

were doing what they honestly could to get a living, but the chances were

against them.  We saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside, at

intervals, and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtained

in Jacob's time.  There were no walls, no fences, no hedges--nothing to

secure a man's possessions but these random heaps of stones.  The

Israelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times, and these other

Arabs, their lineal descendants, do so likewise.  An American, of

ordinary intelligence, would soon widely extend his property, at an

outlay of mere manual labor, performed at night, under so loose a system

of fencing as this.



The plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick, such as Abraham

plowed with, and they still winnow their wheat as he did--they pile it on

the house-top, and then toss it by shovel-fulls into the air until the

wind has blown all the chaff away.  They never invent any thing, never

learn any thing.



We had a fine race, of a mile, with an Arab perched on a camel.  Some of

the horses were fast, and made very good time, but the camel scampered by

them without any very great effort.  The yelling and shouting, and

whipping and galloping, of all parties interested, made it an

exhilarating, exciting, and particularly boisterous race.



At eleven o'clock, our eyes fell upon the walls and columns of Baalbec, a

noble ruin whose history is a sealed book.  It has stood there for

thousands of years, the wonder and admiration of travelers; but who built

it, or when it was built, are questions that may never be answered.  One

thing is very sure, though.  Such grandeur of design, and such grace of

execution, as one sees in the temples of Baalbec, have not been equaled

or even approached in any work of men's hands that has been built within

twenty centuries past.



The great Temple of the Sun, the Temple of Jupiter, and several smaller

temples, are clustered together in the midst of one of these miserable

Syrian villages, and look strangely enough in such plebeian company.

These temples are built upon massive substructions that might support a

world, almost; the materials used are blocks of stone as large as an

omnibus--very few, if any of them, are smaller than a carpenter's tool

chest--and these substructions are traversed by tunnels of masonry

through which a train of cars might pass.  With such foundations as

these, it is little wonder that Baalbec has lasted so long.  The Temple

of the Sun is nearly three hundred feet long and one hundred and sixty

feet wide.  It had fifty-four columns around it, but only six are

standing now--the others lie broken at its base, a confused and

picturesque heap.  The six columns are their bases, Corinthian capitals

and entablature--and six more shapely columns do not exist.  The columns

and the entablature together are ninety feet high--a prodigious altitude

for shafts of stone to reach, truly--and yet one only thinks of their

beauty and symmetry when looking at them; the pillars look slender and

delicate, the entablature, with its elaborate sculpture, looks like rich

stucco-work.  But when you have gazed aloft till your eyes are weary, you

glance at the great fragments of pillars among which you are standing,

and find that they are eight feet through; and with them lie beautiful

capitals apparently as large as a small cottage; and also single slabs of

stone, superbly sculptured, that are four or five feet thick, and would

completely cover the floor of any ordinary parlor.  You wonder where

these monstrous things came from, and it takes some little time to

satisfy yourself that the airy and graceful fabric that towers above your

head is made up of their mates.  It seems too preposterous.



The Temple of Jupiter is a smaller ruin than the one I have been speaking

of, and yet is immense.  It is in a tolerable state of preservation.  One

row of nine columns stands almost uninjured.  They are sixty-five feet

high and support a sort of porch or roof, which connects them with the

roof of the building.  This porch-roof is composed of tremendous slabs of

stone, which are so finely sculptured on the under side that the work

looks like a fresco from below.  One or two of these slabs had fallen,

and again I wondered if the gigantic masses of carved stone that lay

about me were no larger than those above my head.  Within the temple, the

ornamentation was elaborate and colossal.  What a wonder of architectural

beauty and grandeur this edifice must have been when it was new!  And

what a noble picture it and its statelier companion, with the chaos of

mighty fragments scattered about them, yet makes in the moonlight!



I can not conceive how those immense blocks of stone were ever hauled

from the quarries, or how they were ever raised to the dizzy heights they

occupy in the temples.  And yet these sculptured blocks are trifles in

size compared with the rough-hewn blocks that form the wide verandah or

platform which surrounds the Great Temple.  One stretch of that platform,

two hundred feet long, is composed of blocks of stone as large, and some

of them larger, than a street-car.  They surmount a wall about ten or

twelve feet high.  I thought those were large rocks, but they sank into

insignificance compared with those which formed another section of the

platform.  These were three in number, and I thought that each of them

was about as long as three street cars placed end to end, though of

course they are a third wider and a third higher than a street car.

Perhaps two railway freight cars of the largest pattern, placed end to

end, might better represent their size.  In combined length these three

stones stretch nearly two hundred feet; they are thirteen feet square;

two of them are sixty-four feet long each, and the third is sixty-nine.

They are built into the massive wall some twenty feet above the ground.

They are there, but how they got there is the question.  I have seen the

hull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stones.  All these

great walls are as exact and shapely as the flimsy things we build of

bricks in these days.  A race of gods or of giants must have inhabited

Baalbec many a century ago.  Men like the men of our day could hardly

rear such temples as these.



We went to the quarry from whence the stones of Baalbec were taken.  It

was about a quarter of a mile off, and down hill.  In a great pit lay the

mate of the largest stone in the ruins.  It lay there just as the giants

of that old forgotten time had left it when they were called hence--just

as they had left it, to remain for thousands of years, an eloquent rebuke

unto such as are prone to think slightingly of the men who lived before

them.  This enormous block lies there, squared and ready for the

builders' hands--a solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen, and but a few

inches less than seventy feet long!  Two buggies could be driven abreast

of each other, on its surface, from one end of it to the other, and leave

room enough for a man or two to walk on either side.



One might swear that all the John Smiths and George Wilkinsons, and all

the other pitiful nobodies between Kingdom Come and Baalbec would

inscribe their poor little names upon the walls of Baalbec's magnificent

ruins, and would add the town, the county and the State they came from--

and swearing thus, be infallibly correct.  It is a pity some great ruin

does not fall in and flatten out some of these reptiles, and scare their

kind out of ever giving their names to fame upon any walls or monuments

again, forever.



Properly, with the sorry relics we bestrode, it was a three days' journey

to Damascus.  It was necessary that we should do it in less than two.

It was necessary because our three pilgrims would not travel on the

Sabbath day.  We were all perfectly willing to keep the Sabbath day, but

there are times when to keep the letter of a sacred law whose spirit is

righteous, becomes a sin, and this was a case in point.  We pleaded for

the tired, ill-treated horses, and tried to show that their faithful

service deserved kindness in return, and their hard lot compassion.  But

when did ever self-righteousness know the sentiment of pity?  What were a

few long hours added to the hardships of some over-taxed brutes when

weighed against the peril of those human souls?  It was not the most

promising party to travel with and hope to gain a higher veneration for

religion through the example of its devotees.  We said the Saviour who

pitied dumb beasts and taught that the ox must be rescued from the mire

even on the Sabbath day, would not have counseled a forced march like

this.  We said the "long trip" was exhausting and therefore dangerous in

the blistering heats of summer, even when the ordinary days' stages were

traversed, and if we persisted in this hard march, some of us might be

stricken down with the fevers of the country in consequence of it.

Nothing could move the pilgrims.  They must press on.  Men might die,

horses might die, but they must enter upon holy soil next week, with no

Sabbath-breaking stain upon them.  Thus they were willing to commit a sin

against the spirit of religious law, in order that they might preserve

the letter of it.  It was not worth while to tell them "the letter

kills."  I am talking now about personal friends; men whom I like; men

who are good citizens; who are honorable, upright, conscientious; but

whose idea of the Saviour's religion seems to me distorted.  They lecture

our shortcomings unsparingly, and every night they call us together and

read to us chapters from the Testament that are full of gentleness, of

charity, and of tender mercy; and then all the next day they stick to

their saddles clear up to the summits of these rugged mountains, and

clear down again.  Apply the Testament's gentleness, and charity, and

tender mercy to a toiling, worn and weary horse?--Nonsense--these are for

God's human creatures, not His dumb ones.  What the pilgrims choose to

do, respect for their almost sacred character demands that I should allow

to pass--but I would so like to catch any other member of the party

riding his horse up one of these exhausting hills once!



We have given the pilgrims a good many examples that might benefit them,

but it is virtue thrown away.  They have never heard a cross word out of

our lips toward each other--but they have quarreled once or twice.  We

love to hear them at it, after they have been lecturing us.  The very

first thing they did, coming ashore at Beirout, was to quarrel in the

boat.  I have said I like them, and I do like them--but every time they

read me a scorcher of a lecture I mean to talk back in print.



Not content with doubling the legitimate stages, they switched off the

main road and went away out of the way to visit an absurd fountain called

Figia, because Baalam's ass had drank there once.  So we journeyed on,

through the terrible hills and deserts and the roasting sun, and then far

into the night, seeking the honored pool of Baalam's ass, the patron

saint of all pilgrims like us.  I find no entry but this in my note-book:



     "Rode to-day, altogether, thirteen hours, through deserts, partly,

     and partly over barren, unsightly hills, and latterly through wild,

     rocky scenery, and camped at about eleven o'clock at night on the

     banks of a limpid stream, near a Syrian village.  Do not know its

     name--do not wish to know it--want to go to bed.  Two horses lame

     (mine and Jack's) and the others worn out.  Jack and I walked three

     or four miles, over the hills, and led the horses.  Fun--but of a

     mild type."



Twelve or thirteen hours in the saddle, even in a Christian land and a

Christian climate, and on a good horse, is a tiresome journey; but in an

oven like Syria, in a ragged spoon of a saddle that slips fore-and-aft,

and "thort-ships," and every way, and on a horse that is tired and lame,

and yet must be whipped and spurred with hardly a moment's cessation all

day long, till the blood comes from his side, and your conscience hurts

you every time you strike if you are half a man,--it is a journey to be

remembered in bitterness of spirit and execrated with emphasis for a

liberal division of a man's lifetime.









CHAPTER XLIV.



The next day was an outrage upon men and horses both.  It was another

thirteen-hour stretch (including an hour's "nooning.") It was over the

barrenest chalk-hills and through the baldest canons that even Syria can

show.  The heat quivered in the air every where.  In the canons we almost

smothered in the baking atmosphere.  On high ground, the reflection from

the chalk-hills was blinding.  It was cruel to urge the crippled horses,

but it had to be done in order to make Damascus Saturday night.  We saw

ancient tombs and temples of fanciful architecture carved out of the

solid rock high up in the face of precipices above our heads, but we had

neither time nor strength to climb up there and examine them.  The terse

language of my note-book will answer for the rest of this day's

experiences:



     "Broke camp at 7 A.M., and made a ghastly trip through the Zeb Dana

     valley and the rough mountains--horses limping and that Arab

     screech-owl that does most of the singing and carries the water-

     skins, always a thousand miles ahead, of course, and no water to

     drink--will he never die?  Beautiful stream in a chasm, lined thick

     with pomegranate, fig, olive and quince orchards, and nooned an hour

     at the celebrated Baalam's Ass Fountain of Figia, second in size in

     Syria, and the coldest water out of Siberia--guide-books do not

     say Baalam's ass ever drank there--somebody been imposing on the

     pilgrims, may be.  Bathed in it--Jack and I.  Only a second--ice-

     water.  It is the principal source of the Abana river--only one-

     half mile down to where it joins.  Beautiful place--giant trees all

     around--so shady and cool, if one could keep awake--vast stream

     gushes straight out from under the mountain in a torrent.  Over it

     is a very ancient ruin, with no known history--supposed to have been

     for the worship of the deity of the fountain or Baalam's ass or

     somebody.  Wretched nest of human vermin about the fountain--rags,

     dirt, sunken cheeks, pallor of sickness, sores, projecting bones,

     dull, aching misery in their eyes and ravenous hunger speaking from

     every eloquent fibre and muscle from head to foot.  How they sprang

     upon a bone, how they crunched the bread we gave them!  Such as

     these to swarm about one and watch every bite he takes, with greedy

     looks, and swallow unconsciously every time he swallows, as if they

     half fancied the precious morsel went down their own throats--

     hurry up the caravan!--I never shall enjoy a meal in this

     distressful country.  To think of eating three times every day under

     such circumstances for three weeks yet--it is worse punishment than

     riding all day in the sun.  There are sixteen starving babies from

     one to six years old in the party, and their legs are no larger than

     broom handles.  Left the fountain at 1 P.M.  (the fountain took us

     at least two hours out of our way,) and reached Mahomet's lookout

     perch, over Damascus, in time to get a good long look before it was

     necessary to move on.  Tired?  Ask of the winds that far away with

     fragments strewed the sea."



As the glare of day mellowed into twilight, we looked down upon a picture

which is celebrated all over the world.  I think I have read about four

hundred times that when Mahomet was a simple camel-driver he reached this

point and looked down upon Damascus for the first time, and then made a

certain renowned remark.  He said man could enter only one paradise; he

preferred to go to the one above.  So he sat down there and feasted his

eyes upon the earthly paradise of Damascus, and then went away without

entering its gates.  They have erected a tower on the hill to mark the

spot where he stood.



Damascus is beautiful from the mountain.  It is beautiful even to

foreigners accustomed to luxuriant vegetation, and I can easily

understand how unspeakably beautiful it must be to eyes that are only

used to the God-forsaken barrenness and desolation of Syria.  I should

think a Syrian would go wild with ecstacy when such a picture bursts upon

him for the first time.



From his high perch, one sees before him and below him, a wall of dreary

mountains, shorn of vegetation, glaring fiercely in the sun; it fences in

a level desert of yellow sand, smooth as velvet and threaded far away

with fine lines that stand for roads, and dotted with creeping mites we

know are camel-trains and journeying men; right in the midst of the

desert is spread a billowy expanse of green foliage; and nestling in its

heart sits the great white city, like an island of pearls and opals

gleaming out of a sea of emeralds.  This is the picture you see spread

far below you, with distance to soften it, the sun to glorify it, strong

contrasts to heighten the effects, and over it and about it a drowsing

air of repose to spiritualize it and make it seem rather a beautiful

estray from the mysterious worlds we visit in dreams than a substantial

tenant of our coarse, dull globe.  And when you think of the leagues of

blighted, blasted, sandy, rocky, sun-burnt, ugly, dreary, infamous

country you have ridden over to get here, you think it is the most

beautiful, beautiful picture that ever human eyes rested upon in all the

broad universe!  If I were to go to Damascus again, I would camp on

Mahomet's hill about a week, and then go away.  There is no need to go

inside the walls.  The Prophet was wise without knowing it when he

decided not to go down into the paradise of Damascus.



There is an honored old tradition that the immense garden which Damascus

stands in was the Garden of Eden, and modern writers have gathered up

many chapters of evidence tending to show that it really was the Garden

of Eden, and that the rivers Pharpar and Abana are the "two rivers" that

watered Adam's Paradise.  It may be so, but it is not paradise now, and

one would be as happy outside of it as he would be likely to be within.

It is so crooked and cramped and dirty that one can not realize that he

is in the splendid city he saw from the hill-top.  The gardens are hidden

by high mud-walls, and the paradise is become a very sink of pollution

and uncomeliness.  Damascus has plenty of clear, pure water in it,

though, and this is enough, of itself, to make an Arab think it beautiful

and blessed.  Water is scarce in blistered Syria.  We run railways by our

large cities in America; in Syria they curve the roads so as to make them

run by the meagre little puddles they call "fountains," and which are not

found oftener on a journey than every four hours.  But the "rivers" of

Pharpar and Abana of Scripture (mere creeks,) run through Damascus, and

so every house and every garden have their sparkling fountains and

rivulets of water.  With her forest of foliage and her abundance of

water, Damascus must be a wonder of wonders to the Bedouin from the

deserts.  Damascus is simply an oasis--that is what it is.  For four

thousand years its waters have not gone dry or its fertility failed.

Now we can understand why the city has existed so long.  It could not

die.  So long as its waters remain to it away out there in the midst of

that howling desert, so long will Damascus live to bless the sight of the

tired and thirsty wayfarer.



     "Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of

     spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own

     orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!"



Damascus dates back anterior to the days of Abraham, and is the oldest

city in the world.  It was founded by Uz, the grandson of Noah.  "The

early history of Damascus is shrouded in the mists of a hoary antiquity."

Leave the matters written of in the first eleven chapters of the Old

Testament out, and no recorded event has occurred in the world but

Damascus was in existence to receive the news of it.  Go back as far as

you will into the vague past, there was always a Damascus.  In the

writings of every century for more than four thousand years, its name has

been mentioned and its praises sung.  To Damascus, years are only

moments, decades are only flitting trifles of time.  She measures time,

not by days and months and years, but by the empires she has seen rise,

and prosper and crumble to ruin.  She is a type of immortality.  She saw

the foundations of Baalbec, and Thebes, and Ephesus laid; she saw these

villages grow into mighty cities, and amaze the world with their

grandeur--and she has lived to see them desolate, deserted, and given

over to the owls and the bats.  She saw the Israelitish empire exalted,

and she saw it annihilated.  She saw Greece rise, and flourish two

thousand years, and die.  In her old age she saw Rome built; she saw it

overshadow the world with its power; she saw it perish.  The few hundreds

of years of Genoese and Venetian might and splendor were, to grave old

Damascus, only a trifling scintillation hardly worth remembering.

Damascus has seen all that has ever occurred on earth, and still she

lives.  She has looked upon the dry bones of a thousand empires, and will

see the tombs of a thousand more before she dies.  Though another claims

the name, old Damascus is by right the Eternal City.



We reached the city gates just at sundown.  They do say that one can get

into any walled city of Syria, after night, for bucksheesh, except

Damascus.  But Damascus, with its four thousand years of respectability

in the world, has many old fogy notions.  There are no street lamps

there, and the law compels all who go abroad at night to carry lanterns,

just as was the case in old days, when heroes and heroines of the Arabian

Nights walked the streets of Damascus, or flew away toward Bagdad on

enchanted carpets.



It was fairly dark a few minutes after we got within the wall, and we

rode long distances through wonderfully crooked streets, eight to ten

feet wide, and shut in on either aide by the high mud-walls of the

gardens.  At last we got to where lanterns could be seen flitting about

here and there, and knew we were in the midst of the curious old city.

In a little narrow street, crowded with our pack-mules and with a swarm

of uncouth Arabs, we alighted, and through a kind of a hole in the wall

entered the hotel.  We stood in a great flagged court, with flowers and

citron trees about us, and a huge tank in the centre that was receiving

the waters of many pipes.  We crossed the court and entered the rooms

prepared to receive four of us.  In a large marble-paved recess between

the two rooms was a tank of clear, cool water, which was kept running

over all the time by the streams that were pouring into it from half a

dozen pipes.  Nothing, in this scorching, desolate land could look so

refreshing as this pure water flashing in the lamp-light; nothing could

look so beautiful, nothing could sound so delicious as this mimic rain to

ears long unaccustomed to sounds of such a nature.  Our rooms were large,

comfortably furnished, and even had their floors clothed with soft,

cheerful-tinted carpets.  It was a pleasant thing to see a carpet again,

for if there is any thing drearier than the tomb-like, stone-paved

parlors and bed-rooms of Europe and Asia, I do not know what it is.

They make one think of the grave all the time.  A very broad, gaily

caparisoned divan, some twelve or fourteen feet long, extended across one

side of each room, and opposite were single beds with spring mattresses.

There were great looking-glasses and marble-top tables.  All this luxury

was as grateful to systems and senses worn out with an exhausting day's

travel, as it was unexpected--for one can not tell what to expect in a

Turkish city of even a quarter of a million inhabitants.



I do not know, but I think they used that tank between the rooms to draw

drinking water from; that did not occur to me, however, until I had

dipped my baking head far down into its cool depths.  I thought of it

then, and superb as the bath was, I was sorry I had taken it, and was

about to go and explain to the landlord.  But a finely curled and scented

poodle dog frisked up and nipped the calf of my leg just then, and before

I had time to think, I had soused him to the bottom of the tank, and when

I saw a servant coming with a pitcher I went off and left the pup trying

to climb out and not succeeding very well.  Satisfied revenge was all I

needed to make me perfectly happy, and when I walked in to supper that

first night in Damascus I was in that condition.  We lay on those divans

a long time, after supper, smoking narghilies and long-stemmed chibouks,

and talking about the dreadful ride of the day, and I knew then what I

had sometimes known before--that it is worth while to get tired out,

because one so enjoys resting afterward.



In the morning we sent for donkeys.  It is worthy of note that we had to

send for these things.  I said Damascus was an old fossil, and she is.

Any where else we would have been assailed by a clamorous army of donkey-

drivers, guides, peddlers and beggars--but in Damascus they so hate the

very sight of a foreign Christian that they want no intercourse whatever

with him; only a year or two ago, his person was not always safe in

Damascus streets.  It is the most fanatical Mohammedan purgatory out of

Arabia.  Where you see one green turban of a Hadji elsewhere (the honored

sign that my lord has made the pilgrimage to Mecca,) I think you will see

a dozen in Damascus.  The Damascenes are the ugliest, wickedest looking

villains we have seen.  All the veiled women we had seen yet, nearly,

left their eyes exposed, but numbers of these in Damascus completely hid

the face under a close-drawn black veil that made the woman look like a

mummy.  If ever we caught an eye exposed it was quickly hidden from our

contaminating Christian vision; the beggars actually passed us by without

demanding bucksheesh; the merchants in the bazaars did not hold up their

goods and cry out eagerly, "Hey, John!"  or "Look this, Howajji!"  On the

contrary, they only scowled at us and said never a word.



The narrow streets swarmed like a hive with men and women in strange

Oriental costumes, and our small donkeys knocked them right and left as

we plowed through them, urged on by the merciless donkey-boys.  These

persecutors run after the animals, shouting and goading them for hours

together; they keep the donkey in a gallop always, yet never get tired

themselves or fall behind.  The donkeys fell down and spilt us over their

heads occasionally, but there was nothing for it but to mount and hurry

on again.  We were banged against sharp corners, loaded porters, camels,

and citizens generally; and we were so taken up with looking out for

collisions and casualties that we had no chance to look about us at all.

We rode half through the city and through the famous "street which is

called Straight" without seeing any thing, hardly.  Our bones were nearly

knocked out of joint, we were wild with excitement, and our sides ached

with the jolting we had suffered.  I do not like riding in the Damascus

street-cars.



We were on our way to the reputed houses of Judas and Ananias.  About

eighteen or nineteen hundred years ago, Saul, a native of Tarsus, was

particularly bitter against the new sect called Christians, and he left

Jerusalem and started across the country on a furious crusade against

them.  He went forth "breathing threatenings and slaughter against the

disciples of the Lord."



     "And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus, and suddenly there

     shined round about him a light from heaven:



     "And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, 'Saul,

     Saul, why persecutest thou me?'



     "And when he knew that it was Jesus that spoke to him he trembled,

     and was astonished, and said, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?'"



He was told to arise and go into the ancient city and one would tell him

what to do.  In the meantime his soldiers stood speechless and awe-

stricken, for they heard the mysterious voice but saw no man.  Saul rose

up and found that that fierce supernatural light had destroyed his sight,

and he was blind, so "they led him by the hand and brought him to

Damascus."  He was converted.



Paul lay three days, blind, in the house of Judas, and during that time

he neither ate nor drank.



There came a voice to a citizen of Damascus, named Ananias, saying,

"Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire at

the house of Judas, for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for behold, he

prayeth."



Ananias did not wish to go at first, for he had heard of Saul before, and

he had his doubts about that style of a "chosen vessel" to preach the

gospel of peace.  However, in obedience to orders, he went into the

"street called Straight" (how he found his way into it, and after he did,

how he ever found his way out of it again, are mysteries only to be

accounted for by the fact that he was acting under Divine inspiration.)

He found Paul and restored him, and ordained him a preacher; and from

this old house we had hunted up in the street which is miscalled

Straight, he had started out on that bold missionary career which he

prosecuted till his death.  It was not the house of the disciple who sold

the Master for thirty pieces of silver.  I make this explanation in

justice to Judas, who was a far different sort of man from the person

just referred to.  A very different style of man, and lived in a very

good house.  It is a pity we do not know more about him.



I have given, in the above paragraphs, some more information for people

who will not read Bible history until they are defrauded into it by some

such method as this.  I hope that no friend of progress and education

will obstruct or interfere with my peculiar mission.



The street called Straight is straighter than a corkscrew, but not as

straight as a rainbow.  St. Luke is careful not to commit himself; he

does not say it is the street which is straight, but the "street which is

called Straight."  It is a fine piece of irony; it is the only facetious

remark in the Bible, I believe.  We traversed the street called Straight

a good way, and then turned off and called at the reputed house of

Ananias.  There is small question that a part of the original house is

there still; it is an old room twelve or fifteen feet under ground, and

its masonry is evidently ancient.  If Ananias did not live there in St.

Paul's time, somebody else did, which is just as well.  I took a drink

out of Ananias' well, and singularly enough, the water was just as fresh

as if the well had been dug yesterday.



We went out toward the north end of the city to see the place where the

disciples let Paul down over the Damascus wall at dead of night--for he

preached Christ so fearlessly in Damascus that the people sought to kill

him, just as they would to-day for the same offense, and he had to escape

and flee to Jerusalem.



Then we called at the tomb of Mahomet's children and at a tomb which

purported to be that of St. George who killed the dragon, and so on out

to the hollow place under a rock where Paul hid during his flight till

his pursuers gave him up; and to the mausoleum of the five thousand

Christians who were massacred in Damascus in 1861 by the Turks.  They say

those narrow streets ran blood for several days, and that men, women and

children were butchered indiscriminately and left to rot by hundreds all

through the Christian quarter; they say, further, that the stench was

dreadful.  All the Christians who could get away fled from the city, and

the Mohammedans would not defile their hands by burying the "infidel

dogs."  The thirst for blood extended to the high lands of Hermon and

Anti-Lebanon, and in a short time twenty-five thousand more Christians

were massacred and their possessions laid waste.  How they hate a

Christian in Damascus!--and pretty much all over Turkeydom as well.  And

how they will pay for it when Russia turns her guns upon them again!



It is soothing to the heart to abuse England and France for interposing

to save the Ottoman Empire from the destruction it has so richly deserved

for a thousand years.  It hurts my vanity to see these pagans refuse to

eat of food that has been cooked for us; or to eat from a dish we have

eaten from; or to drink from a goatskin which we have polluted with our

Christian lips, except by filtering the water through a rag which they

put over the mouth of it or through a sponge!  I never disliked a

Chinaman as I do these degraded Turks and Arabs, and when Russia is ready

to war with them again, I hope England and France will not find it good

breeding or good judgment to interfere.



In Damascus they think there are no such rivers in all the world as their

little Abana and Pharpar.  The Damascenes have always thought that way.

In 2 Kings, chapter v., Naaman boasts extravagantly about them.  That was

three thousand years ago.  He says: "Are not Abana and Pharpar rivers of

Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?  May I not wash in them

and be clean?"  But some of my readers have forgotten who Naaman was,

long ago.  Naaman was the commander of the Syrian armies.  He was the

favorite of the king and lived in great state.  "He was a mighty man of

valor, but he was a leper."  Strangely enough, the house they point out

to you now as his, has been turned into a leper hospital, and the inmates

expose their horrid deformities and hold up their hands and beg for

bucksheesh when a stranger enters.



One can not appreciate the horror of this disease until he looks upon it

in all its ghastliness, in Naaman's ancient dwelling in Damascus.  Bones

all twisted out of shape, great knots protruding from face and body,

joints decaying and dropping away--horrible!









CHAPTER XLV.



The last twenty-four hours we staid in Damascus I lay prostrate with a

violent attack of cholera, or cholera morbus, and therefore had a good

chance and a good excuse to lie there on that wide divan and take an

honest rest.  I had nothing to do but listen to the pattering of the

fountains and take medicine and throw it up again.  It was dangerous

recreation, but it was pleasanter than traveling in Syria.  I had plenty

of snow from Mount Hermon, and as it would not stay on my stomach, there

was nothing to interfere with my eating it--there was always room for

more.  I enjoyed myself very well.  Syrian travel has its interesting

features, like travel in any other part of the world, and yet to break

your leg or have the cholera adds a welcome variety to it.



We left Damascus at noon and rode across the plain a couple of hours, and

then the party stopped a while in the shade of some fig-trees to give me

a chance to rest.  It was the hottest day we had seen yet--the sun-flames

shot down like the shafts of fire that stream out before a blow-pipe--the

rays seemed to fall in a steady deluge on the head and pass downward like

rain from a roof.  I imagined I could distinguish between the floods of

rays--I thought I could tell when each flood struck my head, when it

reached my shoulders, and when the next one came.  It was terrible.  All

the desert glared so fiercely that my eyes were swimming in tears all the

time.  The boys had white umbrellas heavily lined with dark green.  They

were a priceless blessing.  I thanked fortune that I had one, too,

notwithstanding it was packed up with the baggage and was ten miles

ahead.  It is madness to travel in Syria without an umbrella.  They told

me in Beirout (these people who always gorge you with advice) that it was

madness to travel in Syria without an umbrella.  It was on this account

that I got one.



But, honestly, I think an umbrella is a nuisance any where when its

business is to keep the sun off.  No Arab wears a brim to his fez, or

uses an umbrella, or any thing to shade his eyes or his face, and he

always looks comfortable and proper in the sun.  But of all the

ridiculous sights I ever have seen, our party of eight is the most so--

they do cut such an outlandish figure.  They travel single file; they all

wear the endless white rag of Constantinople wrapped round and round

their hats and dangling down their backs; they all wear thick green

spectacles, with side-glasses to them; they all hold white umbrellas,

lined with green, over their heads; without exception their stirrups are

too short--they are the very worst gang of horsemen on earth, their

animals to a horse trot fearfully hard--and when they get strung out one

after the other; glaring straight ahead and breathless; bouncing high and

out of turn, all along the line; knees well up and stiff, elbows flapping

like a rooster's that is going to crow, and the long file of umbrellas

popping convulsively up and down--when one sees this outrageous picture

exposed to the light of day, he is amazed that the gods don't get out

their thunderbolts and destroy them off the face of the earth!  I do--I

wonder at it.  I wouldn't let any such caravan go through a country of

mine.



And when the sun drops below the horizon and the boys close their

umbrellas and put them under their arms, it is only a variation of the

picture, not a modification of its absurdity.



But may be you can not see the wild extravagance of my panorama.  You

could if you were here.  Here, you feel all the time just as if you were

living about the year 1200 before Christ--or back to the patriarchs--or

forward to the New Era.  The scenery of the Bible is about you--the

customs of the patriarchs are around you--the same people, in the same

flowing robes, and in sandals, cross your path--the same long trains of

stately camels go and come--the same impressive religious solemnity and

silence rest upon the desert and the mountains that were upon them in the

remote ages of antiquity, and behold, intruding upon a scene like this,

comes this fantastic mob of green-spectacled Yanks, with their flapping

elbows and bobbing umbrellas!  It is Daniel in the lion's den with a

green cotton umbrella under his arm, all over again.



My umbrella is with the baggage, and so are my green spectacles--and

there they shall stay.  I will not use them.  I will show some respect

for the eternal fitness of things.  It will be bad enough to get sun-

struck, without looking ridiculous into the bargain.  If I fall, let me

fall bearing about me the semblance of a Christian, at least.



Three or four hours out from Damascus we passed the spot where Saul was

so abruptly converted, and from this place we looked back over the

scorching desert, and had our last glimpse of beautiful Damascus, decked

in its robes of shining green.  After nightfall we reached our tents,

just outside of the nasty Arab village of Jonesborough.  Of course the

real name of the place is El something or other, but the boys still

refuse to recognize the Arab names or try to pronounce them.  When I say

that that village is of the usual style, I mean to insinuate that all

Syrian villages within fifty miles of Damascus are alike--so much alike

that it would require more than human intelligence to tell wherein one

differed from another.  A Syrian village is a hive of huts one story high

(the height of a man,) and as square as a dry-goods box; it is mud-

plastered all over, flat roof and all, and generally whitewashed after a

fashion.  The same roof often extends over half the town, covering many

of the streets, which are generally about a yard wide.  When you ride

through one of these villages at noon-day, you first meet a melancholy

dog, that looks up at you and silently begs that you won't run over him,

but he does not offer to get out of the way; next you meet a young boy

without any clothes on, and he holds out his hand and says "Bucksheesh!"

--he don't really expect a cent, but then he learned to say that before

he learned to say mother, and now he can not break himself of it; next

you meet a woman with a black veil drawn closely over her face, and her

bust exposed; finally, you come to several sore-eyed children and

children in all stages of mutilation and decay; and sitting humbly in the

dust, and all fringed with filthy rags, is a poor devil whose arms and

legs are gnarled and twisted like grape-vines.  These are all the people

you are likely to see.  The balance of the population are asleep within

doors, or abroad tending goats in the plains and on the hill-sides.  The

village is built on some consumptive little water-course, and about it is

a little fresh-looking vegetation.  Beyond this charmed circle, for miles

on every side, stretches a weary desert of sand and gravel, which

produces a gray bunchy shrub like sage-brush.  A Syrian village is the

sorriest sight in the world, and its surroundings are eminently in

keeping with it.



I would not have gone into this dissertation upon Syrian villages but for

the fact that Nimrod, the Mighty Hunter of Scriptural notoriety, is

buried in Jonesborough, and I wished the public to know about how he is

located.  Like Homer, he is said to be buried in many other places, but

this is the only true and genuine place his ashes inhabit.



When the original tribes were dispersed, more than four thousand years

ago, Nimrod and a large party traveled three or four hundred miles, and

settled where the great city of Babylon afterwards stood.  Nimrod built

that city.  He also began to build the famous Tower of Babel, but

circumstances over which he had no control put it out of his power to

finish it.  He ran it up eight stories high, however, and two of them

still stand, at this day--a colossal mass of brickwork, rent down the

centre by earthquakes, and seared and vitrified by the lightnings of an

angry God.  But the vast ruin will still stand for ages, to shame the

puny labors of these modern generations of men.  Its huge compartments

are tenanted by owls and lions, and old Nimrod lies neglected in this

wretched village, far from the scene of his grand enterprise.



We left Jonesborough very early in the morning, and rode forever and

forever and forever, it seemed to me, over parched deserts and rocky

hills, hungry, and with no water to drink.  We had drained the goat-skins

dry in a little while.  At noon we halted before the wretched Arab town

of El Yuba Dam, perched on the side of a mountain, but the dragoman said

if we applied there for water we would be attacked by the whole tribe,

for they did not love Christians.  We had to journey on.  Two hours later

we reached the foot of a tall isolated mountain, which is crowned by the

crumbling castle of Banias, the stateliest ruin of that kind on earth, no

doubt.  It is a thousand feet long and two hundred wide, all of the most

symmetrical, and at the same time the most ponderous masonry.  The

massive towers and bastions are more than thirty feet high, and have been

sixty.  From the mountain's peak its broken turrets rise above the groves

of ancient oaks and olives, and look wonderfully picturesque.  It is of

such high antiquity that no man knows who built it or when it was built.

It is utterly inaccessible, except in one place, where a bridle-path

winds upward among the solid rocks to the old portcullis.  The horses'

hoofs have bored holes in these rocks to the depth of six inches during

the hundreds and hundreds of years that the castle was garrisoned.  We

wandered for three hours among the chambers and crypts and dungeons of

the fortress, and trod where the mailed heels of many a knightly Crusader

had rang, and where Phenician heroes had walked ages before them.



We wondered how such a solid mass of masonry could be affected even by an

earthquake, and could not understand what agency had made Banias a ruin;

but we found the destroyer, after a while, and then our wonder was

increased tenfold.  Seeds had fallen in crevices in the vast walls; the

seeds had sprouted; the tender, insignificant sprouts had hardened; they

grew larger and larger, and by a steady, imperceptible pressure forced

the great stones apart, and now are bringing sure destruction upon a

giant work that has even mocked the earthquakes to scorn!  Gnarled and

twisted trees spring from the old walls every where, and beautify and

overshadow the gray battlements with a wild luxuriance of foliage.



From these old towers we looked down upon a broad, far-reaching green

plain, glittering with the pools and rivulets which are the sources of

the sacred river Jordan.  It was a grateful vision, after so much desert.



And as the evening drew near, we clambered down the mountain, through

groves of the Biblical oaks of Bashan, (for we were just stepping over

the border and entering the long-sought Holy Land,) and at its extreme

foot, toward the wide valley, we entered this little execrable village of

Banias and camped in a great grove of olive trees near a torrent of

sparkling water whose banks are arrayed in fig-trees, pomegranates and

oleanders in full leaf.  Barring the proximity of the village, it is a

sort of paradise.



The very first thing one feels like doing when he gets into camp, all

burning up and dusty, is to hunt up a bath.  We followed the stream up to

where it gushes out of the mountain side, three hundred yards from the

tents, and took a bath that was so icy that if I did not know this was

the main source of the sacred river, I would expect harm to come of it.

It was bathing at noonday in the chilly source of the Abana, "River of

Damascus," that gave me the cholera, so Dr. B.  said.  However, it

generally does give me the cholera to take a bath.



The incorrigible pilgrims have come in with their pockets full of

specimens broken from the ruins.  I wish this vandalism could be stopped.

They broke off fragments from Noah's tomb; from the exquisite sculptures

of the temples of Baalbec; from the houses of Judas and Ananias, in

Damascus; from the tomb of Nimrod the Mighty Hunter in Jonesborough; from

the worn Greek and Roman inscriptions set in the hoary walls of the

Castle of Banias; and now they have been hacking and chipping these old

arches here that Jesus looked upon in the flesh.  Heaven protect the

Sepulchre when this tribe invades Jerusalem!



The ruins here are not very interesting.  There are the massive walls of

a great square building that was once the citadel; there are many

ponderous old arches that are so smothered with debris that they barely

project above the ground; there are heavy-walled sewers through which the

crystal brook of which Jordan is born still runs; in the hill-side are

the substructions of a costly marble temple that Herod the Great built

here--patches of its handsome mosaic floors still remain; there is a

quaint old stone bridge that was here before Herod's time, may be;

scattered every where, in the paths and in the woods, are Corinthian

capitals, broken porphyry pillars, and little fragments of sculpture; and

up yonder in the precipice where the fountain gushes out, are well-worn

Greek inscriptions over niches in the rock where in ancient times the

Greeks, and after them the Romans, worshipped the sylvan god Pan.  But

trees and bushes grow above many of these ruins now; the miserable huts

of a little crew of filthy Arabs are perched upon the broken masonry of

antiquity, the whole place has a sleepy, stupid, rural look about it, and

one can hardly bring himself to believe that a busy, substantially built

city once existed here, even two thousand years ago.  The place was

nevertheless the scene of an event whose effects have added page after

page and volume after volume to the world's history.  For in this place

Christ stood when he said to Peter:



     "Thou art Peter; and upon this rock will I build my church, and the

     gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  And I will give unto

     thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt

     bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt

     loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."



On those little sentences have been built up the mighty edifice of the

Church of Rome; in them lie the authority for the imperial power of the

Popes over temporal affairs, and their godlike power to curse a soul or

wash it white from sin.  To sustain the position of "the only true

Church," which Rome claims was thus conferred upon her, she has fought

and labored and struggled for many a century, and will continue to keep

herself busy in the same work to the end of time.  The memorable words I

have quoted give to this ruined city about all the interest it possesses

to people of the present day.



It seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was once

actually pressed by the feet of the Saviour.  The situation is suggestive

of a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the vagueness

and mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to the character

of a god.  I can not comprehend yet that I am sitting where a god has

stood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god looked

upon, and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors saw him,

and even talked with him, face to face, and carelessly, just as they

would have done with any other stranger.  I can not comprehend this; the

gods of my understanding have been always hidden in clouds and very far

away.



This morning, during breakfast, the usual assemblage of squalid humanity

sat patiently without the charmed circle of the camp and waited for such

crumbs as pity might bestow upon their misery.  There were old and young,

brown-skinned and yellow.  Some of the men were tall and stalwart, (for

one hardly sees any where such splendid-looking men as here in the East,)

but all the women and children looked worn and sad, and distressed with

hunger.  They reminded me much of Indians, did these people.  They had

but little clothing, but such as they had was fanciful in character and

fantastic in its arrangement.  Any little absurd gewgaw or gimcrack they

had they disposed in such a way as to make it attract attention most

readily.  They sat in silence, and with tireless patience watched our

every motion with that vile, uncomplaining impoliteness which is so truly

Indian, and which makes a white man so nervous and uncomfortable and

savage that he wants to exterminate the whole tribe.



These people about us had other peculiarities, which I have noticed in

the noble red man, too: they were infested with vermin, and the dirt had

caked on them till it amounted to bark.



The little children were in a pitiable condition--they all had sore eyes,

and were otherwise afflicted in various ways.  They say that hardly a

native child in all the East is free from sore eyes, and that thousands

of them go blind of one eye or both every year.  I think this must be so,

for I see plenty of blind people every day, and I do not remember seeing

any children that hadn't sore eyes.  And, would you suppose that an

American mother could sit for an hour, with her child in her arms, and

let a hundred flies roost upon its eyes all that time undisturbed?  I see

that every day.  It makes my flesh creep.  Yesterday we met a woman

riding on a little jackass, and she had a little child in her arms--

honestly, I thought the child had goggles on as we approached, and I

wondered how its mother could afford so much style.  But when we drew

near, we saw that the goggles were nothing but a camp meeting of flies

assembled around each of the child's eyes, and at the same time there was

a detachment prospecting its nose.  The flies were happy, the child was

contented, and so the mother did not interfere.



As soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party, they

began to flock in from all quarters.  Dr. B., in the charity of his

nature, had taken a child from a woman who sat near by, and put some sort

of a wash upon its diseased eyes.  That woman went off and started the

whole nation, and it was a sight to see them swarm!  The lame, the halt,

the blind, the leprous--all the distempers that are bred of indolence,

dirt, and iniquity--were represented in the Congress in ten minutes, and

still they came!  Every woman that had a sick baby brought it along, and

every woman that hadn't, borrowed one.  What reverent and what worshiping

looks they bent upon that dread, mysterious power, the Doctor!  They

watched him take his phials out; they watched him measure the particles

of white powder; they watched him add drops of one precious liquid, and

drops of another; they lost not the slightest movement; their eyes were

riveted upon him with a fascination that nothing could distract.

I believe they thought he was gifted like a god.  When each individual

got his portion of medicine, his eyes were radiant with joy--

notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and impassive race--and

upon his face was written the unquestioning faith that nothing on earth

could prevent the patient from getting well now.



Christ knew how to preach to these simple, superstitious, disease-

tortured creatures: He healed the sick.  They flocked to our poor human

doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to the sick child

went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their eyes while

they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his simples or not.

The ancestors of these--people precisely like them in color, dress,

manners, customs, simplicity--flocked in vast multitudes after Christ,

and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with a word, it is no

wonder they worshiped Him.  No wonder His deeds were the talk of the

nation.  No wonder the multitude that followed Him was so great that at

one time--thirty miles from here--they had to let a sick man down through

the roof because no approach could be made to the door; no wonder His

audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preach from a ship

removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder that even in the

desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded His solitude, and He

had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer for their confiding

faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a great commotion in a city

in those days, one neighbor explained it to another in words to this

effect: "They say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!"



Well, as I was saying, the doctor distributed medicine as long as he had

any to distribute, and his reputation is mighty in Galilee this day.

Among his patients was the child of the Shiek's daughter--for even this

poor, ragged handful of sores and sin has its royal Shiek--a poor old

mummy that looked as if he would be more at home in a poor-house than in

the Chief Magistracy of this tribe of hopeless, shirtless savages.  The

princess--I mean the Shiek's daughter--was only thirteen or fourteen

years old, and had a very sweet face and a pretty one.  She was the only

Syrian female we have seen yet who was not so sinfully ugly that she

couldn't smile after ten o'clock Saturday night without breaking the

Sabbath.  Her child was a hard specimen, though--there wasn't enough of

it to make a pie, and the poor little thing looked so pleadingly up at

all who came near it (as if it had an idea that now was its chance or

never,) that we were filled with compassion which was genuine and not put

on.



But this last new horse I have got is trying to break his neck over the

tent-ropes, and I shall have to go out and anchor him.  Jericho and I

have parted company.  The new horse is not much to boast of, I think.

One of his hind legs bends the wrong way, and the other one is as

straight and stiff as a tent-pole.  Most of his teeth are gone, and he is

as blind as bat.  His nose has been broken at some time or other, and is

arched like a culvert now.  His under lip hangs down like a camel's, and

his ears are chopped off close to his head.  I had some trouble at first

to find a name for him, but I finally concluded to call him Baalbec,

because he is such a magnificent ruin.  I can not keep from talking about

my horses, because I have a very long and tedious journey before me, and

they naturally occupy my thoughts about as much as matters of apparently

much greater importance.



We satisfied our pilgrims by making those hard rides from Baalbec to

Damascus, but Dan's horse and Jack's were so crippled we had to leave

them behind and get fresh animals for them.  The dragoman says Jack's

horse died.  I swapped horses with Mohammed, the kingly-looking Egyptian

who is our Ferguson's lieutenant.  By Ferguson I mean our dragoman

Abraham, of course.  I did not take this horse on account of his personal

appearance, but because I have not seen his back.  I do not wish to see

it.  I have seen the backs of all the other horses, and found most of

them covered with dreadful saddle-boils which I know have not been washed

or doctored for years.  The idea of riding all day long over such ghastly

inquisitions of torture is sickening.  My horse must be like the others,

but I have at least the consolation of not knowing it to be so.



I hope that in future I may be spared any more sentimental praises of the

Arab's idolatry of his horse.  In boyhood I longed to be an Arab of the

desert and have a beautiful mare, and call her Selim or Benjamin or

Mohammed, and feed her with my own hands, and let her come into the tent,

and teach her to caress me and look fondly upon me with her great tender

eyes; and I wished that a stranger might come at such a time and offer me

a hundred thousand dollars for her, so that I could do like the other

Arabs--hesitate, yearn for the money, but overcome by my love for my

mare, at last say, "Part with thee, my beautiful one!  Never with my

life!  Away, tempter, I scorn thy gold!"  and then bound into the saddle

and speed over the desert like the wind!



But I recall those aspirations.  If these Arabs be like the other Arabs,

their love for their beautiful mares is a fraud.  These of my

acquaintance have no love for their horses, no sentiment of pity for

them, and no knowledge of how to treat them or care for them.  The Syrian

saddle-blanket is a quilted mattress two or three inches thick.  It is

never removed from the horse, day or night.  It gets full of dirt and

hair, and becomes soaked with sweat.  It is bound to breed sores.  These

pirates never think of washing a horse's back.  They do not shelter the

horses in the tents, either--they must stay out and take the weather as

it comes.  Look at poor cropped and dilapidated "Baalbec," and weep for

the sentiment that has been wasted upon the Selims of romance!









CHAPTER XLVI.



About an hour's ride over a rough, rocky road, half flooded with water,

and through a forest of oaks of Bashan, brought us to Dan.



From a little mound here in the plain issues a broad stream of limpid

water and forms a large shallow pool, and then rushes furiously onward,

augmented in volume.  This puddle is an important source of the Jordan.

Its banks, and those of the brook are respectably adorned with blooming

oleanders, but the unutterable beauty of the spot will not throw a well-

balanced man into convulsions, as the Syrian books of travel would lead

one to suppose.



From the spot I am speaking of, a cannon-ball would carry beyond the

confines of Holy Land and light upon profane ground three miles away.

We were only one little hour's travel within the borders of Holy Land--we

had hardly begun to appreciate yet that we were standing upon any

different sort of earth than that we had always been used to, and see how

the historic names began already to cluster!  Dan--Bashan--Lake Huleh--

the Sources of Jordan--the Sea of Galilee.  They were all in sight but

the last, and it was not far away.  The little township of Bashan was

once the kingdom so famous in Scripture for its bulls and its oaks.

Lake Huleh is the Biblical "Waters of Merom."  Dan was the northern and

Beersheba the southern limit of Palestine--hence the expression "from Dan

to Beersheba."  It is equivalent to our phrases "from Maine to Texas"--

"from Baltimore to San Francisco."  Our expression and that of the

Israelites both mean the same--great distance.  With their slow camels

and asses, it was about a seven days' journey from Dan to Beersheba---say

a hundred and fifty or sixty miles--it was the entire length of their

country, and was not to be undertaken without great preparation and much

ceremony.  When the Prodigal traveled to "a far country," it is not

likely that he went more than eighty or ninety miles.  Palestine is only

from forty to sixty miles wide.  The State of Missouri could be split

into three Palestines, and there would then be enough material left for

part of another--possibly a whole one.  From Baltimore to San Francisco

is several thousand miles, but it will be only a seven days' journey in

the cars when I am two or three years older.--[The railroad has been

completed since the above was written.]--If I live I shall necessarily

have to go across the continent every now and then in those cars, but one

journey from Dan to Beersheba will be sufficient, no doubt.  It must be

the most trying of the two.  Therefore, if we chance to discover that

from Dan to Beersheba seemed a mighty stretch of country to the

Israelites, let us not be airy with them, but reflect that it was and is

a mighty stretch when one can not traverse it by rail.



The small mound I have mentioned a while ago was once occupied by the

Phenician city of Laish.  A party of filibusters from Zorah and Eschol

captured the place, and lived there in a free and easy way, worshiping

gods of their own manufacture and stealing idols from their neighbors

whenever they wore their own out.  Jeroboam set up a golden calf here to

fascinate his people and keep them from making dangerous trips to

Jerusalem to worship, which might result in a return to their rightful

allegiance.  With all respect for those ancient Israelites, I can not

overlook the fact that they were not always virtuous enough to withstand

the seductions of a golden calf.  Human nature has not changed much since

then.



Some forty centuries ago the city of Sodom was pillaged by the Arab

princes of Mesopotamia, and among other prisoners they seized upon the

patriarch Lot and brought him here on their way to their own possessions.

They brought him to Dan, and father Abraham, who was pursuing them, crept

softly in at dead of night, among the whispering oleanders and under the

shadows of the stately oaks, and fell upon the slumbering victors and

startled them from their dreams with the clash of steel.  He recaptured

Lot and all the other plunder.



We moved on.  We were now in a green valley, five or six miles wide and

fifteen long.  The streams which are called the sources of the Jordan

flow through it to Lake Huleh, a shallow pond three miles in diameter,

and from the southern extremity of the Lake the concentrated Jordan flows

out.  The Lake is surrounded by a broad marsh, grown with reeds.  Between

the marsh and the mountains which wall the valley is a respectable strip

of fertile land; at the end of the valley, toward Dan, as much as half

the land is solid and fertile, and watered by Jordan's sources.  There is

enough of it to make a farm.  It almost warrants the enthusiasm of the

spies of that rabble of adventurers who captured Dan.  They said: "We

have seen the land, and behold it is very good.  * * *  A place where

there is no want of any thing that is in the earth."



Their enthusiasm was at least warranted by the fact that they had never

seen a country as good as this.  There was enough of it for the ample

support of their six hundred men and their families, too.



When we got fairly down on the level part of the Danite farm, we came to

places where we could actually run our horses.  It was a notable

circumstance.



We had been painfully clambering over interminable hills and rocks for

days together, and when we suddenly came upon this astonishing piece of

rockless plain, every man drove the spurs into his horse and sped away

with a velocity he could surely enjoy to the utmost, but could never hope

to comprehend in Syria.



Here were evidences of cultivation--a rare sight in this country--an acre

or two of rich soil studded with last season's dead corn-stalks of the

thickness of your thumb and very wide apart.  But in such a land it was a

thrilling spectacle.  Close to it was a stream, and on its banks a great

herd of curious-looking Syrian goats and sheep were gratefully eating

gravel.  I do not state this as a petrified fact--I only suppose they

were eating gravel, because there did not appear to be any thing else for

them to eat.  The shepherds that tended them were the very pictures of

Joseph and his brethren I have no doubt in the world.  They were tall,

muscular, and very dark-skinned Bedouins, with inky black beards.  They

had firm lips, unquailing eyes, and a kingly stateliness of bearing.

They wore the parti-colored half bonnet, half hood, with fringed ends

falling upon their shoulders, and the full, flowing robe barred with

broad black stripes--the dress one sees in all pictures of the swarthy

sons of the desert.  These chaps would sell their younger brothers if

they had a chance, I think.  They have the manners, the customs, the

dress, the occupation and the loose principles of the ancient stock.

[They attacked our camp last night, and I bear them no good will.]

They had with them the pigmy jackasses one sees all over Syria and

remembers in all pictures of the "Flight into Egypt," where Mary and the

Young Child are riding and Joseph is walking alongside, towering high

above the little donkey's shoulders.



But really, here the man rides and carries the child, as a general thing,

and the woman walks.  The customs have not changed since Joseph's time.

We would not have in our houses a picture representing Joseph riding and

Mary walking; we would see profanation in it, but a Syrian Christian

would not.  I know that hereafter the picture I first spoke of will look

odd to me.



We could not stop to rest two or three hours out from our camp, of

course, albeit the brook was beside us.  So we went on an hour longer.

We saw water, then, but nowhere in all the waste around was there a foot

of shade, and we were scorching to death.  "Like unto the shadow of a

great rock in a weary land."  Nothing in the Bible is more beautiful than

that, and surely there is no place we have wandered to that is able to

give it such touching expression as this blistering, naked, treeless

land.



Here you do not stop just when you please, but when you can.  We found

water, but no shade.  We traveled on and found a tree at last, but no

water.  We rested and lunched, and came on to this place, Ain Mellahah

(the boys call it Baldwinsville.) It was a very short day's run, but the

dragoman does not want to go further, and has invented a plausible lie

about the country beyond this being infested by ferocious Arabs, who

would make sleeping in their midst a dangerous pastime.  Well, they ought

to be dangerous.  They carry a rusty old weather-beaten flint-lock gun,

with a barrel that is longer than themselves; it has no sights on it, it

will not carry farther than a brickbat, and is not half so certain.  And

the great sash they wear in many a fold around their waists has two or

three absurd old horse-pistols in it that are rusty from eternal disuse--

weapons that would hang fire just about long enough for you to walk out

of range, and then burst and blow the Arab's head off.  Exceedingly

dangerous these sons of the desert are.



It used to make my blood run cold to read Wm. C. Grimes' hairbreadth

escapes from Bedouins, but I think I could read them now without a

tremor.  He never said he was attacked by Bedouins, I believe, or was

ever treated uncivilly, but then in about every other chapter he

discovered them approaching, any how, and he had a blood-curdling fashion

of working up the peril; and of wondering how his relations far away

would feel could they see their poor wandering boy, with his weary feet

and his dim eyes, in such fearful danger; and of thinking for the last

time of the old homestead, and the dear old church, and the cow, and

those things; and of finally straightening his form to its utmost height

in the saddle, drawing his trusty revolver, and then dashing the spurs

into "Mohammed" and sweeping down upon the ferocious enemy determined to

sell his life as dearly as possible.  True the Bedouins never did any

thing to him when he arrived, and never had any intention of doing any

thing to him in the first place, and wondered what in the mischief he was

making all that to-do about; but still I could not divest myself of the

idea, somehow, that a frightful peril had been escaped through that man's

dare-devil bravery, and so I never could read about Wm. C. Grimes'

Bedouins and sleep comfortably afterward.  But I believe the Bedouins to

be a fraud, now.  I have seen the monster, and I can outrun him.  I shall

never be afraid of his daring to stand behind his own gun and discharge

it.



About fifteen hundred years before Christ, this camp-ground of ours by

the Waters of Merom was the scene of one of Joshua's exterminating

battles.  Jabin, King of Hazor, (up yonder above Dan,) called all the

sheiks about him together, with their hosts, to make ready for Israel's

terrible General who was approaching.



     "And when all these Kings were met together, they came and pitched

     together by the Waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.  And they

     went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as

     the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude," etc.



But Joshua fell upon them and utterly destroyed them, root and branch.

That was his usual policy in war.  He never left any chance for newspaper

controversies about who won the battle.  He made this valley, so quiet

now, a reeking slaughter-pen.



Somewhere in this part of the country--I do not know exactly where--

Israel fought another bloody battle a hundred years later.  Deborah, the

prophetess, told Barak to take ten thousand men and sally forth against

another King Jabin who had been doing something.  Barak came down from

Mount Tabor, twenty or twenty-five miles from here, and gave battle to

Jabin's forces, who were in command of Sisera.  Barak won the fight, and

while he was making the victory complete by the usual method of

exterminating the remnant of the defeated host, Sisera fled away on foot,

and when he was nearly exhausted by fatigue and thirst, one Jael, a woman

he seems to have been acquainted with, invited him to come into her tent

and rest himself.  The weary soldier acceded readily enough, and Jael put

him to bed.  He said he was very thirsty, and asked his generous

preserver to get him a cup of water.  She brought him some milk, and he

drank of it gratefully and lay down again, to forget in pleasant dreams

his lost battle and his humbled pride.  Presently when he was asleep she

came softly in with a hammer and drove a hideous tent-pen down through

his brain!



"For he was fast asleep and weary.  So he died."  Such is the touching

language of the Bible.  "The Song of Deborah and Barak" praises Jael for

the memorable service she had rendered, in an exultant strain:



     "Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,

     blessed shall she be above women in the tent.



     "He asked for water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter

     in a lordly dish.



     "She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's

     hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head

     when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.



     "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,

     he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."



Stirring scenes like these occur in this valley no more.  There is not a

solitary village throughout its whole extent--not for thirty miles in

either direction.  There are two or three small clusters of Bedouin

tents, but not a single permanent habitation.  One may ride ten miles,

hereabouts, and not see ten human beings.



To this region one of the prophecies is applied:



     "I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies which dwell

     therein shall be astonished at it.  And I will scatter you among the

     heathen, and I will draw out a sword after you; and your land shall

     be desolate and your cities waste."



No man can stand here by deserted Ain Mellahah and say the prophecy has

not been fulfilled.



In a verse from the Bible which I have quoted above, occurs the phrase

"all these kings."  It attracted my attention in a moment, because it

carries to my mind such a vastly different significance from what it

always did at home.  I can see easily enough that if I wish to profit by

this tour and come to a correct understanding of the matters of interest

connected with it, I must studiously and faithfully unlearn a great many

things I have somehow absorbed concerning Palestine.  I must begin a

system of reduction.  Like my grapes which the spies bore out of the

Promised Land, I have got every thing in Palestine on too large a scale.

Some of my ideas were wild enough.  The word Palestine always brought to

my mind a vague suggestion of a country as large as the United States.

I do not know why, but such was the case.  I suppose it was because I

could not conceive of a small country having so large a history.  I think

I was a little surprised to find that the grand Sultan of Turkey was a

man of only ordinary size.  I must try to reduce my ideas of Palestine to

a more reasonable shape.  One gets large impressions in boyhood,

sometimes, which he has to fight against all his life.  "All these

kings."  When I used to read that in Sunday School, it suggested to me

the several kings of such countries as England, France, Spain, Germany,

Russia, etc., arrayed in splendid robes ablaze with jewels, marching in

grave procession, with sceptres of gold in their hands and flashing

crowns upon their heads.  But here in Ain Mellahah, after coming through

Syria, and after giving serious study to the character and customs of the

country, the phrase "all these kings" loses its grandeur.  It suggests

only a parcel of petty chiefs--ill-clad and ill-conditioned savages much

like our Indians, who lived in full sight of each other and whose

"kingdoms" were large when they were five miles square and contained two

thousand souls.  The combined monarchies of the thirty "kings" destroyed

by Joshua on one of his famous campaigns, only covered an area about

equal to four of our counties of ordinary size.  The poor old sheik we

saw at Cesarea Philippi with his ragged band of a hundred followers,

would have been called a "king" in those ancient times.



It is seven in the morning, and as we are in the country, the grass ought

to be sparkling with dew, the flowers enriching the air with their

fragrance, and the birds singing in the trees.  But alas, there is no dew

here, nor flowers, nor birds, nor trees.  There is a plain and an

unshaded lake, and beyond them some barren mountains.  The tents are

tumbling, the Arabs are quarreling like dogs and cats, as usual, the

campground is strewn with packages and bundles, the labor of packing them

upon the backs of the mules is progressing with great activity, the

horses are saddled, the umbrellas are out, and in ten minutes we shall

mount and the long procession will move again.  The white city of the

Mellahah, resurrected for a moment out of the dead centuries, will have

disappeared again and left no sign.









CHAPTER XLVII.



We traversed some miles of desolate country whose soil is rich enough,

but is given over wholly to weeds--a silent, mournful expanse, wherein we

saw only three persons--Arabs, with nothing on but a long coarse shirt

like the "tow-linen" shirts which used to form the only summer garment of

little negro boys on Southern plantations.  Shepherds they were, and they

charmed their flocks with the traditional shepherd's pipe--a reed

instrument that made music as exquisitely infernal as these same Arabs

create when they sing.



In their pipes lingered no echo of the wonderful music the shepherd

forefathers heard in the Plains of Bethlehem what time the angels sang

"Peace on earth, good will to men."



Part of the ground we came over was not ground at all, but rocks--cream-

colored rocks, worn smooth, as if by water; with seldom an edge or a

corner on them, but scooped out, honey-combed, bored out with eye-holes,

and thus wrought into all manner of quaint shapes, among which the

uncouth imitation of skulls was frequent.  Over this part of the route

were occasional remains of an old Roman road like the Appian Way, whose

paving-stones still clung to their places with Roman tenacity.



Gray lizards, those heirs of ruin, of sepulchres and desolation, glided

in and out among the rocks or lay still and sunned themselves.  Where

prosperity has reigned, and fallen; where glory has flamed, and gone out;

where beauty has dwelt, and passed away; where gladness was, and sorrow

is; where the pomp of life has been, and silence and death brood in its

high places, there this reptile makes his home, and mocks at human

vanity.  His coat is the color of ashes: and ashes are the symbol of

hopes that have perished, of aspirations that came to nought, of loves

that are buried.  If he could speak, he would say, Build temples: I will

lord it in their ruins; build palaces: I will inhabit them; erect

empires: I will inherit them; bury your beautiful: I will watch the worms

at their work; and you, who stand here and moralize over me: I will crawl

over your corpse at the last.



A few ants were in this desert place, but merely to spend the summer.

They brought their provisions from Ain Mellahah--eleven miles.



Jack is not very well to-day, it is easy to see; but boy as he is, he is

too much of a man to speak of it.  He exposed himself to the sun too much

yesterday, but since it came of his earnest desire to learn, and to make

this journey as useful as the opportunities will allow, no one seeks to

discourage him by fault-finding.  We missed him an hour from the camp,

and then found him some distance away, by the edge of a brook, and with

no umbrella to protect him from the fierce sun.  If he had been used to

going without his umbrella, it would have been well enough, of course;

but he was not.  He was just in the act of throwing a clod at a mud-

turtle which was sunning itself on a small log in the brook.  We said:



"Don't do that, Jack.  What do you want to harm him for?  What has he

done?"



"Well, then, I won't kill him, but I ought to, because he is a fraud."



We asked him why, but he said it was no matter.  We asked him why, once

or twice, as we walked back to the camp but he still said it was no

matter.  But late at night, when he was sitting in a thoughtful mood on

the bed, we asked him again and he said:



"Well, it don't matter; I don't mind it now, but I did not like it today,

you know, because I don't tell any thing that isn't so, and I don't think

the Colonel ought to, either.  But he did; he told us at prayers in the

Pilgrims' tent, last night, and he seemed as if he was reading it out of

the Bible, too, about this country flowing with milk and honey, and about

the voice of the turtle being heard in the land.  I thought that was

drawing it a little strong, about the turtles, any how, but I asked Mr.

Church if it was so, and he said it was, and what Mr. Church tells me, I

believe.  But I sat there and watched that turtle nearly an hour today,

and I almost burned up in the sun; but I never heard him sing.  I believe

I sweated a double handful of sweat---I know I did--because it got in my

eyes, and it was running down over my nose all the time; and you know my

pants are tighter than any body else's--Paris foolishness--and the

buckskin seat of them got wet with sweat, and then got dry again and

began to draw up and pinch and tear loose--it was awful--but I never

heard him sing.  Finally I said, This is a fraud--that is what it is, it

is a fraud--and if I had had any sense I might have known a cursed mud-

turtle couldn't sing.  And then I said, I don't wish to be hard on this

fellow, and I will just give him ten minutes to commence; ten minutes--

and then if he don't, down goes his building.  But he didn't commence,

you know.  I had staid there all that time, thinking may be he might,

pretty soon, because he kept on raising his head up and letting it down,

and drawing the skin over his eyes for a minute and then opening them out

again, as if he was trying to study up something to sing, but just as the

ten minutes were up and I was all beat out and blistered, he laid his

blamed head down on a knot and went fast asleep."



"It was a little hard, after you had waited so long."



"I should think so.  I said, Well, if you won't sing, you shan't sleep,

any way; and if you fellows had let me alone I would have made him shin

out of Galilee quicker than any turtle ever did yet.  But it isn't any

matter now--let it go.  The skin is all off the back of my neck."



About ten in the morning we halted at Joseph's Pit.  This is a ruined

Khan of the Middle Ages, in one of whose side courts is a great walled

and arched pit with water in it, and this pit, one tradition says, is the

one Joseph's brethren cast him into.  A more authentic tradition, aided

by the geography of the country, places the pit in Dothan, some two days'

journey from here.  However, since there are many who believe in this

present pit as the true one, it has its interest.



It is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful passage in a book which

is so gemmed with beautiful passages as the Bible; but it is certain that

not many things within its lids may take rank above the exquisite story

of Joseph.  Who taught those ancient writers their simplicity of

language, their felicity of expression, their pathos, and above all,

their faculty of sinking themselves entirely out of sight of the reader

and making the narrative stand out alone and seem to tell itself?

Shakspeare is always present when one reads his book; Macaulay is present

when we follow the march of his stately sentences; but the Old Testament

writers are hidden from view.



If the pit I have been speaking of is the right one, a scene transpired

there, long ages ago, which is familiar to us all in pictures.  The sons

of Jacob had been pasturing their flocks near there.  Their father grew

uneasy at their long absence, and sent Joseph, his favorite, to see if

any thing had gone wrong with them.  He traveled six or seven days'

journey; he was only seventeen years old, and, boy like, he toiled

through that long stretch of the vilest, rockiest, dustiest country in

Asia, arrayed in the pride of his heart, his beautiful claw-hammer coat

of many colors.  Joseph was the favorite, and that was one crime in the

eyes of his brethren; he had dreamed dreams, and interpreted them to

foreshadow his elevation far above all his family in the far future, and

that was another; he was dressed well and had doubtless displayed the

harmless vanity of youth in keeping the fact prominently before his

brothers.  These were crimes his elders fretted over among themselves and

proposed to punish when the opportunity should offer.  When they saw him

coming up from the Sea of Galilee, they recognized him and were glad.

They said, "Lo, here is this dreamer--let us kill him."  But Reuben

pleaded for his life, and they spared it.  But they seized the boy, and

stripped the hated coat from his back and pushed him into the pit.  They

intended to let him die there, but Reuben intended to liberate him

secretly.  However, while Reuben was away for a little while, the

brethren sold Joseph to some Ishmaelitish merchants who were journeying

towards Egypt.  Such is the history of the pit.  And the self-same pit is

there in that place, even to this day; and there it will remain until the

next detachment of image-breakers and tomb desecraters arrives from the

Quaker City excursion, and they will infallibly dig it up and carry it

away with them.  For behold in them is no reverence for the solemn

monuments of the past, and whithersoever they go they destroy and spare

not.



Joseph became rich, distinguished, powerful--as the Bible expresses it,

"lord over all the land of Egypt."  Joseph was the real king, the

strength, the brain of the monarchy, though Pharaoh held the title.

Joseph is one of the truly great men of the Old Testament.  And he was

the noblest and the manliest, save Esau.  Why shall we not say a good

word for the princely Bedouin?  The only crime that can be brought

against him is that he was unfortunate.  Why must every body praise

Joseph's great-hearted generosity to his cruel brethren, without stint of

fervent language, and fling only a reluctant bone of praise to Esau for

his still sublimer generosity to the brother who had wronged him?  Jacob

took advantage of Esau's consuming hunger to rob him of his birthright

and the great honor and consideration that belonged to the position; by

treachery and falsehood he robbed him of his father's blessing; he made

of him a stranger in his home, and a wanderer.  Yet after twenty years

had passed away and Jacob met Esau and fell at his feet quaking with fear

and begging piteously to be spared the punishment he knew he deserved,

what did that magnificent savage do?  He fell upon his neck and embraced

him!  When Jacob--who was incapable of comprehending nobility of

character--still doubting, still fearing, insisted upon "finding grace

with my lord" by the bribe of a present of cattle, what did the gorgeous

son of the desert say?



"Nay, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself!"



Esau found Jacob rich, beloved by wives and children, and traveling in

state, with servants, herds of cattle and trains of camels--but he

himself was still the uncourted outcast this brother had made him.  After

thirteen years of romantic mystery, the brethren who had wronged Joseph,

came, strangers in a strange land, hungry and humble, to buy "a little

food"; and being summoned to a palace, charged with crime, they beheld in

its owner their wronged brother; they were trembling beggars--he, the

lord of a mighty empire!  What Joseph that ever lived would have thrown

away such a chance to "show off?"  Who stands first--outcast Esau

forgiving Jacob in prosperity, or Joseph on a king's throne forgiving the

ragged tremblers whose happy rascality placed him there?



Just before we came to Joseph's Pit, we had "raised" a hill, and there, a

few miles before us, with not a tree or a shrub to interrupt the view,

lay a vision which millions of worshipers in the far lands of the earth

would give half their possessions to see--the sacred Sea of Galilee!



Therefore we tarried only a short time at the pit.  We rested the horses

and ourselves, and felt for a few minutes the blessed shade of the

ancient buildings.  We were out of water, but the two or three scowling

Arabs, with their long guns, who were idling about the place, said they

had none and that there was none in the vicinity.  They knew there was a

little brackish water in the pit, but they venerated a place made sacred

by their ancestor's imprisonment too much to be willing to see Christian

dogs drink from it.  But Ferguson tied rags and handkerchiefs together

till he made a rope long enough to lower a vessel to the bottom, and we

drank and then rode on; and in a short time we dismounted on those shores

which the feet of the Saviour have made holy ground.



At noon we took a swim in the Sea of Galilee--a blessed privilege in this

roasting climate--and then lunched under a neglected old fig-tree at the

fountain they call Ain-et-Tin, a hundred yards from ruined Capernaum.

Every rivulet that gurgles out of the rocks and sands of this part of the

world is dubbed with the title of "fountain," and people familiar with

the Hudson, the great lakes and the Mississippi fall into transports of

admiration over them, and exhaust their powers of composition in writing

their praises.  If all the poetry and nonsense that have been discharged

upon the fountains and the bland scenery of this region were collected in

a book, it would make a most valuable volume to burn.



During luncheon, the pilgrim enthusiasts of our party, who had been so

light-hearted and so happy ever since they touched holy ground that they

did little but mutter incoherent rhapsodies, could scarcely eat, so

anxious were they to "take shipping" and sail in very person upon the

waters that had borne the vessels of the Apostles.  Their anxiety grew

and their excitement augmented with every fleeting moment, until my fears

were aroused and I began to have misgivings that in their present

condition they might break recklessly loose from all considerations of

prudence and buy a whole fleet of ships to sail in instead of hiring a

single one for an hour, as quiet folk are wont to do.  I trembled to

think of the ruined purses this day's performances might result in.

I could not help reflecting bodingly upon the intemperate zeal with which

middle-aged men are apt to surfeit themselves upon a seductive folly

which they have tasted for the first time.  And yet I did not feel that

I had a right to be surprised at the state of things which was giving me

so much concern.  These men had been taught from infancy to revere,

almost to worship, the holy places whereon their happy eyes were resting

now.  For many and many a year this very picture had visited their

thoughts by day and floated through their dreams by night.  To stand

before it in the flesh--to see it as they saw it now--to sail upon the

hallowed sea, and kiss the holy soil that compassed it about: these were

aspirations they had cherished while a generation dragged its lagging

seasons by and left its furrows in their faces and its frosts upon their

hair.  To look upon this picture, and sail upon this sea, they had

forsaken home and its idols and journeyed thousands and thousands of

miles, in weariness and tribulation.  What wonder that the sordid lights

of work-day prudence should pale before the glory of a hope like theirs

in the full splendor of its fruition?  Let them squander millions!

I said--who speaks of money at a time like this?



In this frame of mind I followed, as fast as I could, the eager footsteps

of the pilgrims, and stood upon the shore of the lake, and swelled, with

hat and voice, the frantic hail they sent after the "ship" that was

speeding by.  It was a success.  The toilers of the sea ran in and

beached their barque.  Joy sat upon every countenance.



"How much?--ask him how much, Ferguson!--how much to take us all--eight

of us, and you--to Bethsaida, yonder, and to the mouth of Jordan, and to

the place where the swine ran down into the sea--quick!--and we want to

coast around every where--every where!--all day long!--I could sail a

year in these waters!--and tell him we'll stop at Magdala and finish at

Tiberias!--ask him how much?--any thing--any thing whatever!--tell him we

don't care what the expense is!"  [I said to myself, I knew how it would

be.]



Ferguson--(interpreting)--"He says two Napoleons--eight dollars."



One or two countenances fell.  Then a pause.



"Too much!--we'll give him one!"



I never shall know how it was--I shudder yet when I think how the place

is given to miracles--but in a single instant of time, as it seemed to

me, that ship was twenty paces from the shore, and speeding away like a

frightened thing!  Eight crestfallen creatures stood upon the shore, and

O, to think of it!  this--this--after all that overmastering ecstacy!

Oh, shameful, shameful ending, after such unseemly boasting!  It was too

much like "Ho! let me at him!"  followed by a prudent "Two of you hold

him--one can hold me!"



Instantly there was wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp.  The two

Napoleons were offered--more if necessary--and pilgrims and dragoman

shouted themselves hoarse with pleadings to the retreating boatmen to

come back.  But they sailed serenely away and paid no further heed to

pilgrims who had dreamed all their lives of some day skimming over the

sacred waters of Galilee and listening to its hallowed story in the

whisperings of its waves, and had journeyed countless leagues to do it,

and--and then concluded that the fare was too high.  Impertinent

Mohammedan Arabs, to think such things of gentlemen of another faith!



Well, there was nothing to do but just submit and forego the privilege of

voyaging on Genessaret, after coming half around the globe to taste that

pleasure.  There was a time, when the Saviour taught here, that boats

were plenty among the fishermen of the coasts--but boats and fishermen

both are gone, now; and old Josephus had a fleet of men-of-war in these

waters eighteen centuries ago--a hundred and thirty bold canoes--but

they, also, have passed away and left no sign.  They battle here no more

by sea, and the commercial marine of Galilee numbers only two small

ships, just of a pattern with the little skiffs the disciples knew.  One

was lost to us for good--the other was miles away and far out of hail.

So we mounted the horses and rode grimly on toward Magdala, cantering

along in the edge of the water for want of the means of passing over it.



How the pilgrims abused each other!  Each said it was the other's fault,

and each in turn denied it.  No word was spoken by the sinners--even the

mildest sarcasm might have been dangerous at such a time.  Sinners that

have been kept down and had examples held up to them, and suffered

frequent lectures, and been so put upon in a moral way and in the matter

of going slow and being serious and bottling up slang, and so crowded in

regard to the matter of being proper and always and forever behaving,

that their lives have become a burden to them, would not lag behind

pilgrims at such a time as this, and wink furtively, and be joyful, and

commit other such crimes--because it would not occur to them to do it.

Otherwise they would.  But they did do it, though--and it did them a

world of good to hear the pilgrims abuse each other, too.  We took an

unworthy satisfaction in seeing them fall out, now and then, because it

showed that they were only poor human people like us, after all.



So we all rode down to Magdala, while the gnashing of teeth waxed and

waned by turns, and harsh words troubled the holy calm of Galilee.



Lest any man think I mean to be ill-natured when I talk about our

pilgrims as I have been talking, I wish to say in all sincerity that I do

not.  I would not listen to lectures from men I did not like and could

not respect; and none of these can say I ever took their lectures

unkindly, or was restive under the infliction, or failed to try to profit

by what they said to me.  They are better men than I am; I can say that

honestly; they are good friends of mine, too--and besides, if they did

not wish to be stirred up occasionally in print, why in the mischief did

they travel with me?  They knew me.  They knew my liberal way--that I

like to give and take--when it is for me to give and other people to

take.  When one of them threatened to leave me in Damascus when I had the

cholera, he had no real idea of doing it--I know his passionate nature

and the good impulses that underlie it.  And did I not overhear Church,

another pilgrim, say he did not care who went or who staid, he would

stand by me till I walked out of Damascus on my own feet or was carried

out in a coffin, if it was a year?  And do I not include Church every

time I abuse the pilgrims--and would I be likely to speak ill-naturedly

of him?  I wish to stir them up and make them healthy; that is all.



We had left Capernaum behind us.  It was only a shapeless ruin.  It bore

no semblance to a town, and had nothing about it to suggest that it had

ever been a town.  But all desolate and unpeopled as it was, it was

illustrious ground.  From it sprang that tree of Christianity whose broad

arms overshadow so many distant lands to-day.  After Christ was tempted

of the devil in the desert, he came here and began his teachings; and

during the three or four years he lived afterward, this place was his

home almost altogether.  He began to heal the sick, and his fame soon

spread so widely that sufferers came from Syria and beyond Jordan, and

even from Jerusalem, several days' journey away, to be cured of their

diseases.  Here he healed the centurion's servant and Peter's mother-in-

law, and multitudes of the lame and the blind and persons possessed of

devils; and here, also, he raised Jairus's daughter from the dead.  He

went into a ship with his disciples, and when they roused him from sleep

in the midst of a storm, he quieted the winds and lulled the troubled sea

to rest with his voice.  He passed over to the other side, a few miles

away and relieved two men of devils, which passed into some swine.  After

his return he called Matthew from the receipt of customs, performed some

cures, and created scandal by eating with publicans and sinners.  Then he

went healing and teaching through Galilee, and even journeyed to Tyre and

Sidon.  He chose the twelve disciples, and sent them abroad to preach the

new gospel.  He worked miracles in Bethsaida and Chorazin--villages two

or three miles from Capernaum.  It was near one of them that the

miraculous draft of fishes is supposed to have been taken, and it was in

the desert places near the other that he fed the thousands by the

miracles of the loaves and fishes.  He cursed them both, and Capernaum

also, for not repenting, after all the great works he had done in their

midst, and prophesied against them.  They are all in ruins, now--which is

gratifying to the pilgrims, for, as usual, they fit the eternal words of

gods to the evanescent things of this earth; Christ, it is more probable,

referred to the people, not their shabby villages of wigwams: he said it

would be sad for them at "the day of judgment"--and what business have

mud-hovels at the Day of Judgment?  It would not affect the prophecy in

the least--it would neither prove it or disprove it--if these towns were

splendid cities now instead of the almost vanished ruins they are.

Christ visited Magdala, which is near by Capernaum, and he also visited

Cesarea Philippi.  He went up to his old home at Nazareth, and saw his

brothers Joses, and Judas, and James, and Simon--those persons who, being

own brothers to Jesus Christ, one would expect to hear mentioned

sometimes, yet who ever saw their names in a newspaper or heard them from

a pulpit?  Who ever inquires what manner of youths they were; and whether

they slept with Jesus, played with him and romped about him; quarreled

with him concerning toys and trifles; struck him in anger, not suspecting

what he was?  Who ever wonders what they thought when they saw him come

back to Nazareth a celebrity, and looked long at his unfamiliar face to

make sure, and then said, "It is Jesus?"  Who wonders what passed in

their minds when they saw this brother, (who was only a brother to them,

however much he might be to others a mysterious stranger who was a god

and had stood face to face with God above the clouds,) doing strange

miracles with crowds of astonished people for witnesses?  Who wonders if

the brothers of Jesus asked him to come home with them, and said his

mother and his sisters were grieved at his long absence, and would be

wild with delight to see his face again?  Who ever gives a thought to

the sisters of Jesus at all?--yet he had sisters; and memories of them

must have stolen into his mind often when he was ill-treated among

strangers; when he was homeless and said he had not where to lay his

head; when all deserted him, even Peter, and he stood alone among his

enemies.



Christ did few miracles in Nazareth, and staid but a little while.  The

people said, "This the Son of God!  Why, his father is nothing but a

carpenter.  We know the family.  We see them every day.  Are not his

brothers named so and so, and his sisters so and so, and is not his

mother the person they call Mary?  This is absurd."  He did not curse his

home, but he shook its dust from his feet and went away.



Capernaum lies close to the edge of the little sea, in a small plain some

five miles long and a mile or two wide, which is mildly adorned with

oleanders which look all the better contrasted with the bald hills and

the howling deserts which surround them, but they are not as deliriously

beautiful as the books paint them.  If one be calm and resolute he can

look upon their comeliness and live.



One of the most astonishing things that have yet fallen under our

observation is the exceedingly small portion of the earth from which

sprang the now flourishing plant of Christianity.  The longest journey

our Saviour ever performed was from here to Jerusalem--about one hundred

to one hundred and twenty miles.  The next longest was from here to

Sidon--say about sixty or seventy miles.  Instead of being wide apart--as

American appreciation of distances would naturally suggest--the places

made most particularly celebrated by the presence of Christ are nearly

all right here in full view, and within cannon-shot of Capernaum.

Leaving out two or three short journeys of the Saviour, he spent his

life, preached his gospel, and performed his miracles within a compass no

larger than an ordinary county in the United States.  It is as much as I

can do to comprehend this stupefying fact.  How it wears a man out to

have to read up a hundred pages of history every two or three miles--for

verily the celebrated localities of Palestine occur that close together.

How wearily, how bewilderingly they swarm about your path!



In due time we reached the ancient village of Magdala.









CHAPTER XLVIII.



Magdala is not a beautiful place.  It is thoroughly Syrian, and that is

to say that it is thoroughly ugly, and cramped, squalid, uncomfortable,

and filthy--just the style of cities that have adorned the country since

Adam's time, as all writers have labored hard to prove, and have

succeeded.  The streets of Magdala are any where from three to six feet

wide, and reeking with uncleanliness.  The houses are from five to seven

feet high, and all built upon one arbitrary plan--the ungraceful form of

a dry-goods box.  The sides are daubed with a smooth white plaster, and

tastefully frescoed aloft and alow with disks of camel-dung placed there

to dry.  This gives the edifice the romantic appearance of having been

riddled with cannon-balls, and imparts to it a very warlike aspect.  When

the artist has arranged his materials with an eye to just proportion--the

small and the large flakes in alternate rows, and separated by carefully-

considered intervals--I know of nothing more cheerful to look upon than a

spirited Syrian fresco.  The flat, plastered roof is garnished by

picturesque stacks of fresco materials, which, having become thoroughly

dried and cured, are placed there where it will be convenient.  It is

used for fuel.  There is no timber of any consequence in Palestine--none

at all to waste upon fires--and neither are there any mines of coal.

If my description has been intelligible, you will perceive, now, that a

square, flat-roofed hovel, neatly frescoed, with its wall-tops gallantly

bastioned and turreted with dried camel-refuse, gives to a landscape a

feature that is exceedingly festive and picturesque, especially if one is

careful to remember to stick in a cat wherever, about the premises, there

is room for a cat to sit.  There are no windows to a Syrian hut, and no

chimneys.  When I used to read that they let a bed-ridden man down

through the roof of a house in Capernaum to get him into the presence of

the Saviour, I generally had a three-story brick in my mind, and marveled

that they did not break his neck with the strange experiment.  I perceive

now, however, that they might have taken him by the heels and thrown him

clear over the house without discommoding him very much.  Palestine is

not changed any since those days, in manners, customs, architecture, or

people.



As we rode into Magdala not a soul was visible.  But the ring of the

horses' hoofs roused the stupid population, and they all came trooping

out--old men and old women, boys and girls, the blind, the crazy, and the

crippled, all in ragged, soiled and scanty raiment, and all abject

beggars by nature, instinct and education.  How the vermin-tortured

vagabonds did swarm!  How they showed their scars and sores, and

piteously pointed to their maimed and crooked limbs, and begged with

their pleading eyes for charity!  We had invoked a spirit we could not

lay.  They hung to the horses's tails, clung to their manes and the

stirrups, closed in on every aide in scorn of dangerous hoofs--and out of

their infidel throats, with one accord, burst an agonizing and most

infernal chorus: "Howajji, bucksheesh!  howajji, bucksheesh!  howajji,

bucksheesh!  bucksheesh!  bucksheesh!"  I never was in a storm like that

before.



As we paid the bucksheesh out to sore-eyed children and brown, buxom

girls with repulsively tattooed lips and chins, we filed through the town

and by many an exquisite fresco, till we came to a bramble-infested

inclosure and a Roman-looking ruin which had been the veritable dwelling

of St. Mary Magdalene, the friend and follower of Jesus.  The guide

believed it, and so did I.  I could not well do otherwise, with the house

right there before my eyes as plain as day.  The pilgrims took down

portions of the front wall for specimens, as is their honored custom, and

then we departed.



We are camped in this place, now, just within the city walls of Tiberias.

We went into the town before nightfall and looked at its people--we cared

nothing about its houses.  Its people are best examined at a distance.

They are particularly uncomely Jews, Arabs, and negroes.  Squalor and

poverty are the pride of Tiberias.  The young women wear their dower

strung upon a strong wire that curves downward from the top of the head

to the jaw--Turkish silver coins which they have raked together or

inherited.  Most of these maidens were not wealthy, but some few had been

very kindly dealt with by fortune.  I saw heiresses there worth, in their

own right--worth, well, I suppose I might venture to say, as much as nine

dollars and a half.  But such cases are rare.  When you come across one

of these, she naturally puts on airs.  She will not ask for bucksheesh.

She will not even permit of undue familiarity.  She assumes a crushing

dignity and goes on serenely practicing with her fine-tooth comb and

quoting poetry just the same as if you were not present at all.  Some

people can not stand prosperity.



They say that the long-nosed, lanky, dyspeptic-looking body-snatchers,

with the indescribable hats on, and a long curl dangling down in front of

each ear, are the old, familiar, self-righteous Pharisees we read of in

the Scriptures.  Verily, they look it.  Judging merely by their general

style, and without other evidence, one might easily suspect that self-

righteousness was their specialty.



From various authorities I have culled information concerning Tiberias.

It was built by Herod Antipas, the murderer of John the Baptist, and

named after the Emperor Tiberius.  It is believed that it stands upon the

site of what must have been, ages ago, a city of considerable

architectural pretensions, judging by the fine porphyry pillars that are

scattered through Tiberias and down the lake shore southward.  These were

fluted, once, and yet, although the stone is about as hard as iron, the

flutings are almost worn away.  These pillars are small, and doubtless

the edifices they adorned were distinguished more for elegance than

grandeur.  This modern town--Tiberias--is only mentioned in the New

Testament; never in the Old.



The Sanhedrim met here last, and for three hundred years Tiberias was the

metropolis of the Jews in Palestine.  It is one of the four holy cities

of the Israelites, and is to them what Mecca is to the Mohammedan and

Jerusalem to the Christian.  It has been the abiding place of many

learned and famous Jewish rabbins.  They lie buried here, and near them

lie also twenty-five thousand of their faith who traveled far to be near

them while they lived and lie with them when they died.  The great Rabbi

Ben Israel spent three years here in the early part of the third century.

He is dead, now.



The celebrated Sea of Galilee is not so large a sea as Lake Tahoe--

[I measure all lakes by Tahoe, partly because I am far more familiar with

it than with any other, and partly because I have such a high admiration

for it and such a world of pleasant recollections of it, that it is very

nearly impossible for me to speak of lakes and not mention it.]--by a

good deal--it is just about two-thirds as large.  And when we come to

speak of beauty, this sea is no more to be compared to Tahoe than a

meridian of longitude is to a rainbow.  The dim waters of this pool can

not suggest the limpid brilliancy of Tahoe; these low, shaven, yellow

hillocks of rocks and sand, so devoid of perspective, can not suggest the

grand peaks that compass Tahoe like a wall, and whose ribbed and chasmed

fronts are clad with stately pines that seem to grow small and smaller as

they climb, till one might fancy them reduced to weeds and shrubs far

upward, where they join the everlasting snows.  Silence and solitude

brood over Tahoe; and silence and solitude brood also over this lake of

Genessaret.  But the solitude of the one is as cheerful and fascinating

as the solitude of the other is dismal and repellant.



In the early morning one watches the silent battle of dawn and darkness

upon the waters of Tahoe with a placid interest; but when the shadows

sulk away and one by one the hidden beauties of the shore unfold

themselves in the full splendor of noon; when the still surface is belted

like a rainbow with broad bars of blue and green and white, half the

distance from circumference to centre; when, in the lazy summer

afternoon, he lies in a boat, far out to where the dead blue of the deep

water begins, and smokes the pipe of peace and idly winks at the

distant crags and patches of snow from under his cap-brim; when the boat

drifts shoreward to the white water, and he lolls over the gunwale and

gazes by the hour down through the crystal depths and notes the colors of

the pebbles and reviews the finny armies gliding in procession a hundred

feet below; when at night he sees moon and stars, mountain ridges

feathered with pines, jutting white capes, bold promontories, grand

sweeps of rugged scenery topped with bald, glimmering peaks, all

magnificently pictured in the polished mirror of the lake, in richest,

softest detail, the tranquil interest that was born with the morning

deepens and deepens, by sure degrees, till it culminates at last in

resistless fascination!



It is solitude, for birds and squirrels on the shore and fishes in the

water are all the creatures that are near to make it otherwise, but it is

not the sort of solitude to make one dreary.  Come to Galilee for that.

If these unpeopled deserts, these rusty mounds of barrenness, that never,

never, never do shake the glare from their harsh outlines, and fade and

faint into vague perspective; that melancholy ruin of Capernaum; this

stupid village of Tiberias, slumbering under its six funereal plumes of

palms; yonder desolate declivity where the swine of the miracle ran down

into the sea, and doubtless thought it was better to swallow a devil or

two and get drowned into the bargain than have to live longer in such a

place; this cloudless, blistering sky; this solemn, sailless, tintless

lake, reposing within its rim of yellow hills and low, steep banks, and

looking just as expressionless and unpoetical (when we leave its sublime

history out of the question,) as any metropolitan reservoir in

Christendom--if these things are not food for rock me to sleep, mother,

none exist, I think.



But I should not offer the evidence for the prosecution and leave the

defense unheard.  Wm. C. Grimes deposes as follows:--



     "We had taken ship to go over to the other side.  The sea was not

     more than six miles wide.  Of the beauty of the scene, however, I

     can not say enough, nor can I imagine where those travelers carried

     their eyes who have described the scenery of the lake as tame or

     uninteresting.  The first great characteristic of it is the deep

     basin in which it lies.  This is from three to four hundred feet

     deep on all sides except at the lower end, and the sharp slope of

     the banks, which are all of the richest green, is broken and

     diversified by the wadys and water-courses which work their way down

     through the sides of the basin, forming dark chasms or light sunny

     valleys.  Near Tiberias these banks are rocky, and ancient

     sepulchres open in them, with their doors toward the water.  They

     selected grand spots, as did the Egyptians of old, for burial

     places, as if they designed that when the voice of God should reach

     the sleepers, they should walk forth and open their eyes on scenes

     of glorious beauty.  On the east, the wild and desolate mountains

     contrast finely with the deep blue lake; and toward the north,

     sublime and majestic, Hermon looks down on the sea, lifting his

     white crown to heaven with the pride of a hill that has seen the

     departing footsteps of a hundred generations.  On the north-east

     shore of the sea was a single tree, and this is the only tree of any

     size visible from the water of the lake, except a few lonely palms

     in the city of Tiberias, and by its solitary position attracts more

     attention than would a forest.  The whole appearance of the scene is

     precisely what we would expect and desire the scenery of Genessaret

     to be, grand beauty, but quiet calm.  The very mountains are calm."



It is an ingeniously written description, and well calculated to deceive.

But if the paint and the ribbons and the flowers be stripped from it, a

skeleton will be found beneath.



So stripped, there remains a lake six miles wide and neutral in color;

with steep green banks, unrelieved by shrubbery; at one end bare,

unsightly rocks, with (almost invisible) holes in them of no consequence

to the picture; eastward, "wild and desolate mountains;" (low, desolate

hills, he should have said;) in the north, a mountain called Hermon, with

snow on it; peculiarity of the picture, "calmness;" its prominent

feature, one tree.



No ingenuity could make such a picture beautiful--to one's actual vision.



I claim the right to correct misstatements, and have so corrected the

color of the water in the above recapitulation.  The waters of Genessaret

are of an exceedingly mild blue, even from a high elevation and a

distance of five miles.  Close at hand (the witness was sailing on the

lake,) it is hardly proper to call them blue at all, much less "deep"

blue.  I wish to state, also, not as a correction, but as matter of

opinion, that Mount Hermon is not a striking or picturesque mountain by

any means, being too near the height of its immediate neighbors to be so.

That is all.  I do not object to the witness dragging a mountain forty-

five miles to help the scenery under consideration, because it is

entirely proper to do it, and besides, the picture needs it.



"C. W. E.," (of "Life in the Holy Land,") deposes as follows:--



     "A beautiful sea lies unbosomed among the Galilean hills, in the

     midst of that land once possessed by Zebulon and Naphtali, Asher and

     Dan.  The azure of the sky penetrates the depths of the lake, and

     the waters are sweet and cool.  On the west, stretch broad fertile

     plains; on the north the rocky shores rise step by step until in the

     far distance tower the snowy heights of Hermon; on the east through

     a misty veil are seen the high plains of Perea, which stretch away

     in rugged mountains leading the mind by varied paths toward

     Jerusalem the Holy.  Flowers bloom in this terrestrial paradise,

     once beautiful and verdant with waving trees; singing birds enchant

     the ear; the turtle-dove soothes with its soft note; the crested

     lark sends up its song toward heaven, and the grave and stately

     stork inspires the mind with thought, and leads it on to meditation

     and repose.  Life here was once idyllic, charming; here were once no

     rich, no poor, no high, no low.  It was a world of ease, simplicity,

     and beauty; now it is a scene of desolation and misery."



This is not an ingenious picture.  It is the worst I ever saw.  It

describes in elaborate detail what it terms a "terrestrial paradise," and

closes with the startling information that this paradise is "a scene of

desolation and misery."



I have given two fair, average specimens of the character of the

testimony offered by the majority of the writers who visit this region.

One says, "Of the beauty of the scene I can not say enough," and then

proceeds to cover up with a woof of glittering sentences a thing which,

when stripped for inspection, proves to be only an unobtrusive basin of

water, some mountainous desolation, and one tree.  The other, after a

conscientious effort to build a terrestrial paradise out of the same

materials, with the addition of a "grave and stately stork," spoils it

all by blundering upon the ghastly truth at the last.



Nearly every book concerning Galilee and its lake describes the scenery

as beautiful.  No--not always so straightforward as that.  Sometimes the

impression intentionally conveyed is that it is beautiful, at the same

time that the author is careful not to say that it is, in plain Saxon.

But a careful analysis of these descriptions will show that the materials

of which they are formed are not individually beautiful and can not be

wrought into combinations that are beautiful.  The veneration and the

affection which some of these men felt for the scenes they were speaking

of, heated their fancies and biased their judgment; but the pleasant

falsities they wrote were full of honest sincerity, at any rate.  Others

wrote as they did, because they feared it would be unpopular to write

otherwise.  Others were hypocrites and deliberately meant to deceive.

Any of them would say in a moment, if asked, that it was always right and

always best to tell the truth.  They would say that, at any rate, if they

did not perceive the drift of the question.



But why should not the truth be spoken of this region?  Is the truth

harmful?  Has it ever needed to hide its face?  God made the Sea of

Galilee and its surroundings as they are.  Is it the province of Mr.

Grimes to improve upon the work?



I am sure, from the tenor of books I have read, that many who have

visited this land in years gone by, were Presbyterians, and came seeking

evidences in support of their particular creed; they found a Presbyterian

Palestine, and they had already made up their minds to find no other,

though possibly they did not know it, being blinded by their zeal.

Others were Baptists, seeking Baptist evidences and a Baptist Palestine.

Others were Catholics, Methodists, Episcopalians, seeking evidences

indorsing their several creeds, and a Catholic, a Methodist, an

Episcopalian Palestine.  Honest as these men's intentions may have been,

they were full of partialities and prejudices, they entered the country

with their verdicts already prepared, and they could no more write

dispassionately and impartially about it than they could about their own

wives and children.  Our pilgrims have brought their verdicts with them.

They have shown it in their conversation ever since we left Beirout.

I can almost tell, in set phrase, what they will say when they see Tabor,

Nazareth, Jericho and Jerusalem--because I have the books they will

"smouch" their ideas from.  These authors write pictures and frame

rhapsodies, and lesser men follow and see with the author's eyes instead

of their own, and speak with his tongue.  What the pilgrims said at

Cesarea Philippi surprised me with its wisdom.  I found it afterwards in

Robinson.  What they said when Genessaret burst upon their vision,

charmed me with its grace.  I find it in Mr. Thompson's "Land and the

Book."  They have spoken often, in happily worded language which never

varied, of how they mean to lay their weary heads upon a stone at Bethel,

as Jacob did, and close their dim eyes, and dream, perchance, of angels

descending out of heaven on a ladder.  It was very pretty.  But I have

recognized the weary head and the dim eyes, finally.  They borrowed the

idea--and the words--and the construction--and the punctuation--from

Grimes.  The pilgrims will tell of Palestine, when they get home, not as

it appeared to them, but as it appeared to Thompson and Robinson and

Grimes--with the tints varied to suit each pilgrim's creed.



Pilgrims, sinners and Arabs are all abed, now, and the camp is still.

Labor in loneliness is irksome.  Since I made my last few notes, I have

been sitting outside the tent for half an hour.  Night is the time to see

Galilee.  Genessaret under these lustrous stars has nothing repulsive

about it.  Genessaret with the glittering reflections of the

constellations flecking its surface, almost makes me regret that I ever

saw the rude glare of the day upon it.  Its history and its associations

are its chiefest charm, in any eyes, and the spells they weave are feeble

in the searching light of the sun.  Then, we scarcely feel the fetters.

Our thoughts wander constantly to the practical concerns of life, and

refuse to dwell upon things that seem vague and unreal.  But when the day

is done, even the most unimpressible must yield to the dreamy influences

of this tranquil starlight.  The old traditions of the place steal upon

his memory and haunt his reveries, and then his fancy clothes all sights

and sounds with the supernatural.  In the lapping of the waves upon the

beach, he hears the dip of ghostly oars; in the secret noises of the

night he hears spirit voices; in the soft sweep of the breeze, the rush

of invisible wings.  Phantom ships are on the sea, the dead of twenty

centuries come forth from the tombs, and in the dirges of the night wind

the songs of old forgotten ages find utterance again.



In the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the

heavens, and is a theatre meet for great events; meet for the birth of a

religion able to save a world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed

to stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees.  But in the

sunlight, one says: Is it for the deeds which were done and the words

which were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand eighteen

centuries gone, that the bells are ringing to-day in the remote islands

of the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference

of the huge globe?



One can comprehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and

created a theatre proper for so grand a drama.









CHAPTER XLIX.



We took another swim in the Sea of Galilee at twilight yesterday, and

another at sunrise this morning.  We have not sailed, but three swims are

equal to a sail, are they not?  There were plenty of fish visible in the

water, but we have no outside aids in this pilgrimage but "Tent Life in

the Holy Land," "The Land and the Book," and other literature of like

description--no fishing-tackle.  There were no fish to be had in the

village of Tiberias.  True, we saw two or three vagabonds mending their

nets, but never trying to catch any thing with them.



We did not go to the ancient warm baths two miles below Tiberias.  I had

no desire in the world to go there.  This seemed a little strange, and

prompted me to try to discover what the cause of this unreasonable

indifference was.  It turned out to be simply because Pliny mentions

them.  I have conceived a sort of unwarrantable unfriendliness toward

Pliny and St. Paul, because it seems as if I can never ferret out a place

that I can have to myself.  It always and eternally transpires that St.

Paul has been to that place, and Pliny has "mentioned" it.



In the early morning we mounted and started.  And then a weird apparition

marched forth at the head of the procession--a pirate, I thought, if ever

a pirate dwelt upon land.  It was a tall Arab, as swarthy as an Indian;

young-say thirty years of age.  On his head he had closely bound a

gorgeous yellow and red striped silk scarf, whose ends, lavishly fringed

with tassels, hung down between his shoulders and dallied with the wind.

From his neck to his knees, in ample folds, a robe swept down that was a

very star-spangled banner of curved and sinuous bars of black and white.

Out of his back, somewhere, apparently, the long stem of a chibouk

projected, and reached far above his right shoulder.  Athwart his back,

diagonally, and extending high above his left shoulder, was an Arab gum

of Saladin's time, that was splendid with silver plating from stock clear

up to the end of its measureless stretch of barrel.  About his waist was

bound many and many a yard of elaborately figured but sadly tarnished

stuff that came from sumptuous Persia, and among the baggy folds in front

the sunbeams glinted from a formidable battery of old brass-mounted

horse-pistols and the gilded hilts of blood-thirsty knives.  There were

holsters for more pistols appended to the wonderful stack of long-haired

goat-skins and Persian carpets, which the man had been taught to regard

in the light of a saddle; and down among the pendulous rank of vast

tassels that swung from that saddle, and clanging against the iron shovel

of a stirrup that propped the warrior's knees up toward his chin, was a

crooked, silver-clad scimitar of such awful dimensions and such

implacable expression that no man might hope to look upon it and not

shudder.  The fringed and bedizened prince whose privilege it is to ride

the pony and lead the elephant into a country village is poor and naked

compared to this chaos of paraphernalia, and the happy vanity of the one

is the very poverty of satisfaction compared to the majestic serenity,

the overwhelming complacency of the other.



"Who is this?  What is this?"  That was the trembling inquiry all down

the line.



"Our guard!  From Galilee to the birthplace of the Savior, the country is

infested with fierce Bedouins, whose sole happiness it is, in this life,

to cut and stab and mangle and murder unoffending Christians.  Allah be

with us!"



"Then hire a regiment!  Would you send us out among these desperate

hordes, with no salvation in our utmost need but this old turret?"



The dragoman laughed--not at the facetiousness of the simile, for verily,

that guide or that courier or that dragoman never yet lived upon earth

who had in him the faintest appreciation of a joke, even though that joke

were so broad and so ponderous that if it fell on him it would flatten

him out like a postage stamp--the dragoman laughed, and then, emboldened

by some thought that was in his brain, no doubt, proceeded to extremities

and winked.



In straits like these, when a man laughs, it is encouraging when he

winks, it is positively reassuring.  He finally intimated that one guard

would be sufficient to protect us, but that that one was an absolute

necessity.  It was because of the moral weight his awful panoply would

have with the Bedouins.  Then I said we didn't want any guard at all.

If one fantastic vagabond could protect eight armed Christians and a pack

of Arab servants from all harm, surely that detachment could protect

themselves.  He shook his head doubtfully.  Then I said, just think of

how it looks--think of how it would read, to self-reliant Americans, that

we went sneaking through this deserted wilderness under the protection of

this masquerading Arab, who would break his neck getting out of the

country if a man that was a man ever started after him.  It was a mean,

low, degrading position.  Why were we ever told to bring navy revolvers

with us if we had to be protected at last by this infamous star-spangled

scum of the desert?  These appeals were vain--the dragoman only smiled

and shook his head.



I rode to the front and struck up an acquaintance with King Solomon-in-

all-his-glory, and got him to show me his lingering eternity of a gun.

It had a rusty flint lock; it was ringed and barred and plated with

silver from end to end, but it was as desperately out of the

perpendicular as are the billiard cues of '49 that one finds yet in

service in the ancient mining camps of California.  The muzzle was eaten

by the rust of centuries into a ragged filigree-work, like the end of a

burnt-out stove-pipe.  I shut one eye and peered within--it was flaked

with iron rust like an old steamboat boiler.  I borrowed the ponderous

pistols and snapped them.  They were rusty inside, too--had not been

loaded for a generation.  I went back, full of encouragement, and

reported to the guide, and asked him to discharge this dismantled

fortress.  It came out, then.  This fellow was a retainer of the Sheik of

Tiberias.  He was a source of Government revenue.  He was to the Empire

of Tiberias what the customs are to America.  The Sheik imposed guards

upon travelers and charged them for it.  It is a lucrative source of

emolument, and sometimes brings into the national treasury as much as

thirty-five or forty dollars a year.



I knew the warrior's secret now; I knew the hollow vanity of his rusty

trumpery, and despised his asinine complacency.  I told on him, and with

reckless daring the cavalcade straight ahead into the perilous solitudes

of the desert, and scorned his frantic warnings of the mutilation and

death that hovered about them on every side.



Arrived at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above the lake, (I ought

to mention that the lake lies six hundred feet below the level of the

Mediterranean--no traveler ever neglects to flourish that fragment of

news in his letters,) as bald and unthrilling a panorama as any land can

afford, perhaps, was spread out before us.  Yet it was so crowded with

historical interest, that if all the pages that have been written about

it were spread upon its surface, they would flag it from horizon to

horizon like a pavement.  Among the localities comprised in this view,

were Mount Hermon; the hills that border Cesarea Philippi, Dan, the

Sources of the Jordan and the Waters of Merom; Tiberias; the Sea of

Galilee; Joseph's Pit; Capernaum; Bethsaida; the supposed scenes of the

Sermon on the Mount, the feeding of the multitudes and the miraculous

draught of fishes; the declivity down which the swine ran to the sea; the

entrance and the exit of the Jordan; Safed, "the city set upon a hill,"

one of the four holy cities of the Jews, and the place where they believe

the real Messiah will appear when he comes to redeem the world; part of

the battle-field of Hattin, where the knightly Crusaders fought their

last fight, and in a blaze of glory passed from the stage and ended their

splendid career forever; Mount Tabor, the traditional scene of the Lord's

Transfiguration.  And down toward the southeast lay a landscape that

suggested to my mind a quotation (imperfectly remembered, no doubt:)



     "The Ephraimites, not being called upon to share in the rich spoils

     of the Ammonitish war, assembled a mighty host to fight against

     Jeptha, Judge of Israel; who, being apprised of their approach,

     gathered together the men of Israel and gave them battle and put

     them to flight.  To make his victory the more secure, he stationed

     guards at the different fords and passages of the Jordan, with

     instructions to let none pass who could not say Shibboleth.  The

     Ephraimites, being of a different tribe, could not frame to

     pronounce the word right, but called it Sibboleth, which proved them

     enemies and cost them their lives; wherefore, forty and two thousand

     fell at the different fords and passages of the Jordan that day."



We jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from Damascus to

Jerusalem and Egypt, past Lubia and other Syrian hamlets, perched, in the

unvarying style, upon the summit of steep mounds and hills, and fenced

round about with giant cactuses, (the sign of worthless land,) with

prickly pears upon them like hams, and came at last to the battle-field

of Hattin.



It is a grand, irregular plateau, and looks as if it might have been

created for a battle-field.  Here the peerless Saladin met the Christian

host some seven hundred years ago, and broke their power in Palestine for

all time to come.  There had long been a truce between the opposing

forces, but according to the Guide-Book, Raynauld of Chatillon, Lord of

Kerak, broke it by plundering a Damascus caravan, and refusing to give up

either the merchants or their goods when Saladin demanded them.  This

conduct of an insolent petty chieftain stung the Sultan to the quick, and

he swore that he would slaughter Raynauld with his own hand, no matter

how, or when, or where he found him.  Both armies prepared for war.

Under the weak King of Jerusalem was the very flower of the Christian

chivalry.  He foolishly compelled them to undergo a long, exhausting

march, in the scorching sun, and then, without water or other

refreshment, ordered them to encamp in this open plain.  The splendidly

mounted masses of Moslem soldiers swept round the north end of

Genessaret, burning and destroying as they came, and pitched their camp

in front of the opposing lines.  At dawn the terrific fight began.

Surrounded on all sides by the Sultan's swarming battalions, the

Christian Knights fought on without a hope for their lives.  They fought

with desperate valor, but to no purpose; the odds of heat and numbers,

and consuming thirst, were too great against them.  Towards the middle of

the day the bravest of their band cut their way through the Moslem ranks

and gained the summit of a little hill, and there, hour after hour, they

closed around the banner of the Cross, and beat back the charging

squadrons of the enemy.



But the doom of the Christian power was sealed.  Sunset found Saladin

Lord of Palestine, the Christian chivalry strewn in heaps upon the field,

and the King of Jerusalem, the Grand Master of the Templars, and Raynauld

of Chatillon, captives in the Sultan's tent.  Saladin treated two of the

prisoners with princely courtesy, and ordered refreshments to be set

before them.  When the King handed an iced Sherbet to Chatillon, the

Sultan said," It is thou that givest it to him, not I."  He remembered

his oath, and slaughtered the hapless Knight of Chatillon with his own

hand.



It was hard to realize that this silent plain had once resounded with

martial music and trembled to the tramp of armed men.  It was hard to

people this solitude with rushing columns of cavalry, and stir its torpid

pulses with the shouts of victors, the shrieks of the wounded, and the

flash of banner and steel above the surging billows of war.  A desolation

is here that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life and

action.



We reached Tabor safely, and considerably in advance of that old iron-

clad swindle of a guard.  We never saw a human being on the whole route,

much less lawless hordes of Bedouins.  Tabor stands solitary and alone,

a giant sentinel above the Plain of Esdraelon.  It rises some fourteen

hundred feet above the surrounding level, a green, wooden cone,

symmetrical and full of grace--a prominent landmark, and one that is

exceedingly pleasant to eyes surfeited with the repulsive monotony of

desert Syria.  We climbed the steep path to its summit, through breezy

glades of thorn and oak.  The view presented from its highest peak was

almost beautiful.  Below, was the broad, level plain of Esdraelon,

checkered with fields like a chess-board, and full as smooth and level,

seemingly; dotted about its borders with white, compact villages, and

faintly penciled, far and near, with the curving lines of roads and

trails.  When it is robed in the fresh verdure of spring, it must form a

charming picture, even by itself.  Skirting its southern border rises

"Little Hermon," over whose summit a glimpse of Gilboa is caught.  Nain,

famous for the raising of the widow's son, and Endor, as famous for the

performances of her witch are in view.  To the eastward lies the Valley

of the Jordan and beyond it the mountains of Gilead.  Westward is Mount

Carmel.  Hermon in the north--the table-lands of Bashan--Safed, the holy

city, gleaming white upon a tall spur of the mountains of Lebanon--a

steel-blue corner of the Sea of Galilee--saddle-peaked Hattin,

traditional "Mount of Beatitudes" and mute witness brave fights of the

Crusading host for Holy Cross--these fill up the picture.



To glance at the salient features of this landscape through the

picturesque framework of a ragged and ruined stone window--arch of the

time of Christ, thus hiding from sight all that is unattractive, is to

secure to yourself a pleasure worth climbing the mountain to enjoy.  One

must stand on his head to get the best effect in a fine sunset, and set a

landscape in a bold, strong framework that is very close at hand, to

bring out all its beauty.  One learns this latter truth never more to

forget it, in that mimic land of enchantment, the wonderful garden of my

lord the Count Pallavicini, near Genoa.  You go wandering for hours among

hills and wooded glens, artfully contrived to leave the impression that

Nature shaped them and not man; following winding paths and coming

suddenly upon leaping cascades and rustic bridges; finding sylvan lakes

where you expected them not; loitering through battered mediaeval castles

in miniature that seem hoary with age and yet were built a dozen years

ago; meditating over ancient crumbling tombs, whose marble columns were

marred and broken purposely by the modern artist that made them;

stumbling unawares upon toy palaces, wrought of rare and costly

materials, and again upon a peasant's hut, whose dilapidated furniture

would never suggest that it was made so to order; sweeping round and

round in the midst of a forest on an enchanted wooden horse that is moved

by some invisible agency; traversing Roman roads and passing under

majestic triumphal arches; resting in quaint bowers where unseen spirits

discharge jets of water on you from every possible direction, and where

even the flowers you touch assail you with a shower; boating on a

subterranean lake among caverns and arches royally draped with clustering

stalactites, and passing out into open day upon another lake, which is

bordered with sloping banks of grass and gay with patrician barges that

swim at anchor in the shadow of a miniature marble temple that rises out

of the clear water and glasses its white statues, its rich capitals and

fluted columns in the tranquil depths.  So, from marvel to marvel you

have drifted on, thinking all the time that the one last seen must be the

chiefest.  And, verily, the chiefest wonder is reserved until the last,

but you do not see it until you step ashore, and passing through a

wilderness of rare flowers, collected from every corner of the earth, you

stand at the door of one more mimic temple.  Right in this place the

artist taxed his genius to the utmost, and fairly opened the gates of

fairy land.  You look through an unpretending pane of glass, stained

yellow--the first thing you see is a mass of quivering foliage, ten short

steps before you, in the midst of which is a ragged opening like a

gateway-a thing that is common enough in nature, and not apt to excite

suspicions of a deep human design--and above the bottom of the gateway,

project, in the most careless way! a few broad tropic leaves and

brilliant flowers.  All of a sudden, through this bright, bold gateway,

you catch a glimpse of the faintest, softest, richest picture that ever

graced the dream of a dying Saint, since John saw the New Jerusalem

glimmering above the clouds of Heaven.  A broad sweep of sea, flecked

with careening sails; a sharp, jutting cape, and a lofty lighthouse on

it; a sloping lawn behind it; beyond, a portion of the old "city of

palaces," with its parks and hills and stately mansions; beyond these, a

prodigious mountain, with its strong outlines sharply cut against ocean

and sky; and over all, vagrant shreds and flakes of cloud, floating in a

sea of gold.  The ocean is gold, the city is gold, the meadow, the

mountain, the sky--every thing is golden-rich, and mellow, and dreamy as

a vision of Paradise.  No artist could put upon canvas, its entrancing

beauty, and yet, without the yellow glass, and the carefully contrived

accident of a framework that cast it into enchanted distance and shut out

from it all unattractive features, it was not a picture to fall into

ecstasies over.  Such is life, and the trail of the serpent is over us

all.



There is nothing for it now but to come back to old Tabor, though the

subject is tiresome enough, and I can not stick to it for wandering off

to scenes that are pleasanter to remember.  I think I will skip, any how.

There is nothing about Tabor (except we concede that it was the scene of

the Transfiguration,) but some gray old ruins, stacked up there in all

ages of the world from the days of stout Gideon and parties that

flourished thirty centuries ago to the fresh yesterday of Crusading

times.  It has its Greek Convent, and the coffee there is good, but never

a splinter of the true cross or bone of a hallowed saint to arrest the

idle thoughts of worldlings and turn them into graver channels.

A Catholic church is nothing to me that has no relics.



The plain of Esdraelon--"the battle-field of the nations"--only sets one

to dreaming of Joshua, and Benhadad, and Saul, and Gideon; Tamerlane,

Tancred, Coeur de Lion, and Saladin; the warrior Kings of Persia, Egypt's

heroes, and Napoleon--for they all fought here.  If the magic of the

moonlight could summon from the graves of forgotten centuries and many

lands the countless myriads that have battled on this wide, far-reaching

floor, and array them in the thousand strange Costumes of their hundred

nationalities, and send the vast host sweeping down the plain, splendid

with plumes and banners and glittering lances, I could stay here an age

to see the phantom pageant.  But the magic of the moonlight is a vanity

and a fraud; and whoso putteth his trust in it shall suffer sorrow and

disappointment.



Down at the foot of Tabor, and just at the edge of the storied Plain of

Esdraelon, is the insignificant village of Deburieh, where Deborah,

prophetess of Israel, lived.  It is just like Magdala.









CHAPTER L.



We descended from Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, followed a hilly,

rocky road to Nazareth--distant two hours.  All distances in the East are

measured by hours, not miles.  A good horse will walk three miles an hour

over nearly any kind of a road; therefore, an hour, here, always stands

for three miles.  This method of computation is bothersome and annoying;

and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries no

intelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan

hours into Christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of a

foreign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough to

catch the meaning in a moment.  Distances traveled by human feet are also

estimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of the

calculation is.  In Constantinople you ask, "How far is it to the

Consulate?" and they answer, "About ten minutes."  "How far is it to the

Lloyds' Agency?"  "Quarter of an hour."  "How far is it to the lower

bridge?"  "Four minutes."  I can not be positive about it, but I think

that there, when a man orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants them

a quarter of a minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.



Two hours from Tabor to Nazareth--and as it was an uncommonly narrow,

crooked trail, we necessarily met all the camel trains and jackass

caravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular place and

nowhere else.  The donkeys do not matter so much, because they are so

small that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of

spirit, but a camel is not jumpable.  A camel is as tall as any ordinary

dwelling-house in Syria--which is to say a camel is from one to two, and

sometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man.  In this part

of the country his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks--one

on each side.  He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage.

Think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail.  The camel

would not turn out for a king.  He stalks serenely along, bringing his

cushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, and

whatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped out

forcibly by the bulky sacks.  It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectly

exhausting to the horses.  We were compelled to jump over upwards of

eighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseated

less than sixty times by the camels.  This seems like a powerful

statement, but the poet has said, "Things are not what they seem."  I can

not think of any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than to

have a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear

with its cold, flabby under-lip.  A camel did this for one of the boys,

who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study.  He glanced up and saw

the majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to

get out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder

before he accomplished it.  This was the only pleasant incident of the

journey.



At Nazareth we camped in an olive grove near the Virgin Mary's fountain,

and that wonderful Arab "guard" came to collect some bucksheesh for his

"services" in following us from Tiberias and warding off invisible

dangers with the terrors of his armament.  The dragoman had paid his

master, but that counted as nothing--if you hire a man to sneeze for you,

here, and another man chooses to help him, you have got to pay both.

They do nothing whatever without pay.  How it must have surprised these

people to hear the way of salvation offered to them "without money and

without price."  If the manners, the people or the customs of this

country have changed since the Saviour's time, the figures and metaphors

of the Bible are not the evidences to prove it by.



We entered the great Latin Convent which is built over the traditional

dwelling-place of the Holy Family.  We went down a flight of fifteen

steps below the ground level, and stood in a small chapel tricked out

with tapestry hangings, silver lamps, and oil paintings.  A spot marked

by a cross, in the marble floor, under the altar, was exhibited as the

place made forever holy by the feet of the Virgin when she stood up to

receive the message of the angel.  So simple, so unpretending a locality,

to be the scene of so mighty an event!  The very scene of the

Annunciation--an event which has been commemorated by splendid shrines

and august temples all over the civilized world, and one which the

princes of art have made it their loftiest ambition to picture worthily

on their canvas; a spot whose history is familiar to the very children of

every house, and city, and obscure hamlet of the furthest lands of

Christendom; a spot which myriads of men would toil across the breadth of

a world to see, would consider it a priceless privilege to look upon.

It was easy to think these thoughts.  But it was not easy to bring myself

up to the magnitude of the situation.  I could sit off several thousand

miles and imagine the angel appearing, with shadowy wings and lustrous

countenance, and note the glory that streamed downward upon the Virgin's

head while the message from the Throne of God fell upon her ears--any one

can do that, beyond the ocean, but few can do it here.  I saw the little

recess from which the angel stepped, but could not fill its void.  The

angels that I know are creatures of unstable fancy--they will not fit in

niches of substantial stone.  Imagination labors best in distant fields.

I doubt if any man can stand in the Grotto of the Annunciation and people

with the phantom images of his mind its too tangible walls of stone.



They showed us a broken granite pillar, depending from the roof, which

they said was hacked in two by the Moslem conquerors of Nazareth, in the

vain hope of pulling down the sanctuary.  But the pillar remained

miraculously suspended in the air, and, unsupported itself, supported

then and still supports the roof.  By dividing this statement up among

eight, it was found not difficult to believe it.



These gifted Latin monks never do any thing by halves.  If they were to

show you the Brazen Serpent that was elevated in the wilderness, you

could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on

also, and even the hole it stood in.  They have got the "Grotto" of the

Annunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one's throat is to his

mouth, they have also the Virgin's Kitchen, and even her sitting-room,

where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with Hebrew toys

eighteen hundred years ago.  All under one roof, and all clean, spacious,

comfortable "grottoes."  It seems curious that personages intimately

connected with the Holy Family always lived in grottoes--in Nazareth, in

Bethlehem, in imperial Ephesus--and yet nobody else in their day and

generation thought of doing any thing of the kind.  If they ever did,

their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder at the

peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of.  When the Virgin

fled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the same

is there to this day.  The slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem was

done in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a grotto--both are shown to

pilgrims yet.  It is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events all

happened in grottoes--and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because the

strongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the living

rock will last forever.  It is an imposture--this grotto stuff--but it is

one that all men ought to thank the Catholics for.  Wherever they ferret

out a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they straightway

build a massive--almost imperishable--church there, and preserve the

memory of that locality for the gratification of future generations.  If

it had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy work, we would not

even know where Jerusalem is to-day, and the man who could go and put his

finger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world.  The world owes the

Catholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out these

bogus grottoes in the rock; for it is infinitely more satisfactory to

look at a grotto, where people have faithfully believed for centuries

that the Virgin once lived, than to have to imagine a dwelling-place for

her somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and at large all over this town

of Nazareth.  There is too large a scope of country.  The imagination can

not work.  There is no one particular spot to chain your eye, rivet your

interest, and make you think.  The memory of the Pilgrims can not perish

while Plymouth Rock remains to us.  The old monks are wise.  They know

how to drive a stake through a pleasant tradition that will hold it to

its place forever.



We visited the places where Jesus worked for fifteen years as a

carpenter, and where he attempted to teach in the synagogue and was

driven out by a mob.  Catholic chapels stand upon these sites and protect

the little fragments of the ancient walls which remain.  Our pilgrims

broke off specimens.  We visited, also, a new chapel, in the midst of the

town, which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feet

thick; the priests discovered, a few years ago, that the disciples had

sat upon this rock to rest, once, when they had walked up from Capernaum.

They hastened to preserve the relic.  Relics are very good property.

Travelers are expected to pay for seeing them, and they do it cheerfully.

We like the idea.  One's conscience can never be the worse for the

knowledge that he has paid his way like a man.  Our pilgrims would have

liked very well to get out their lampblack and stencil-plates and paint

their names on that rock, together with the names of the villages they

hail from in America, but the priests permit nothing of that kind.

To speak the strict truth, however, our party seldom offend in that way,

though we have men in the ship who never lose an opportunity to do it.

Our pilgrims' chief sin is their lust for "specimens."  I suppose that by

this time they know the dimensions of that rock to an inch, and its

weight to a ton; and I do not hesitate to charge that they will go back

there to-night and try to carry it off.



This "Fountain of the Virgin" is the one which tradition says Mary used

to get water from, twenty times a day, when she was a girl, and bear it

away in a jar upon her head.  The water streams through faucets in the

face of a wall of ancient masonry which stands removed from the houses of

the village.  The young girls of Nazareth still collect about it by the

dozen and keep up a riotous laughter and sky-larking.  The Nazarene girls

are homely.  Some of them have large, lustrous eyes, but none of them

have pretty faces.  These girls wear a single garment, usually, and it is

loose, shapeless, of undecided color; it is generally out of repair, too.

They wear, from crown to jaw, curious strings of old coins, after the

manner of the belles of Tiberias, and brass jewelry upon their wrists and

in their ears.  They wear no shoes and stockings.  They are the most

human girls we have found in the country yet, and the best natured.

But there is no question that these picturesque maidens sadly lack

comeliness.



A pilgrim--the "Enthusiast"--said: "See that tall, graceful girl! look at

the Madonna-like beauty of her countenance!"



Another pilgrim came along presently and said: "Observe that tall,

graceful girl; what queenly Madonna-like gracefulness of beauty is in her

countenance."



I said: "She is not tall, she is short; she is not beautiful, she is

homely; she is graceful enough, I grant, but she is rather boisterous."



The third and last pilgrim moved by, before long, and he said: "Ah, what

a tall, graceful girl! what Madonna-like gracefulness of queenly beauty!"



The verdicts were all in.  It was time, now, to look up the authorities

for all these opinions.  I found this paragraph, which follows.  Written

by whom?  Wm. C. Grimes:



     "After we were in the saddle, we rode down to the spring to have a

     last look at the women of Nazareth, who were, as a class, much the

     prettiest that we had seen in the East.  As we approached the crowd

     a tall girl of nineteen advanced toward Miriam and offered her a cup

     of water.  Her movement was graceful and queenly.  We exclaimed on

     the spot at the Madonna-like beauty of her countenance.  Whitely was

     suddenly thirsty, and begged for water, and drank it slowly, with

     his eyes over the top of the cup, fixed on her large black eyes,

     which gazed on him quite as curiously as he on her.  Then Moreright

     wanted water.  She gave it to him and he managed to spill it so as

     to ask for another cup, and by the time she came to me she saw

     through the operation; her eyes were full of fun as she looked at

     me.  I laughed outright, and she joined me in as gay a shout as ever

     country maiden in old Orange county.  I wished for a picture of her.

     A Madonna, whose face was a portrait of that beautiful Nazareth

     girl, would be a 'thing of beauty' and 'a joy forever.'"



That is the kind of gruel which has been served out from Palestine for

ages.  Commend me to Fennimore Cooper to find beauty in the Indians, and

to Grimes to find it in the Arabs.  Arab men are often fine looking, but

Arab women are not.  We can all believe that the Virgin Mary was

beautiful; it is not natural to think otherwise; but does it follow that

it is our duty to find beauty in these present women of Nazareth?



I love to quote from Grimes, because he is so dramatic.  And because he

is so romantic.  And because he seems to care but little whether he tells

the truth or not, so he scares the reader or excites his envy or his

admiration.



He went through this peaceful land with one hand forever on his revolver,

and the other on his pocket-handkerchief.  Always, when he was not on the

point of crying over a holy place, he was on the point of killing an

Arab.  More surprising things happened to him in Palestine than ever

happened to any traveler here or elsewhere since Munchausen died.



At Beit Jin, where nobody had interfered with him, he crept out of his

tent at dead of night and shot at what he took to be an Arab lying on a

rock, some distance away, planning evil.  The ball killed a wolf.  Just

before he fired, he makes a dramatic picture of himself--as usual, to

scare the reader:



     "Was it imagination, or did I see a moving object on the surface of

     the rock?  If it were a man, why did he not now drop me?  He had a

     beautiful shot as I stood out in my black boornoose against the

     white tent.  I had the sensation of an entering bullet in my throat,

     breast, brain."



Reckless creature!



Riding toward Genessaret, they saw two Bedouins, and "we looked to our

pistols and loosened them quietly in our shawls," etc.  Always cool.



In Samaria, he charged up a hill, in the face of a volley of stones; he

fired into the crowd of men who threw them.  He says:



     "I never lost an opportunity of impressing the Arabs with the

     perfection of American and English weapons, and the danger of

     attacking any one of the armed Franks.  I think the lesson of that

     ball not lost."



At Beit Jin he gave his whole band of Arab muleteers a piece of his mind,

and then--



     "I contented myself with a solemn assurance that if there occurred

     another instance of disobedience to orders I would thrash the

     responsible party as he never dreamed of being thrashed, and if I

     could not find who was responsible, I would whip them all, from

     first to last, whether there was a governor at hand to do it or I

     had to do it myself"



Perfectly fearless, this man.



He rode down the perpendicular path in the rocks, from the Castle of

Banias to the oak grove, at a flying gallop, his horse striding "thirty

feet" at every bound.  I stand prepared to bring thirty reliable

witnesses to prove that Putnam's famous feat at Horseneck was

insignificant compared to this.



Behold him--always theatrical--looking at Jerusalem--this time, by an

oversight, with his hand off his pistol for once.



     "I stood in the road, my hand on my horse's neck, and with my dim

     eyes sought to trace the outlines of the holy places which I had

     long before fixed in my mind, but the fast-flowing tears forbade my

     succeeding.  There were our Mohammedan servants, a Latin monk, two

     Armenians and a Jew in our cortege, and all alike gazed with

     overflowing eyes."



If Latin monks and Arabs cried, I know to a moral certainty that the

horses cried also, and so the picture is complete.



But when necessity demanded, he could be firm as adamant.  In the Lebanon

Valley an Arab youth--a Christian; he is particular to explain that

Mohammedans do not steal--robbed him of a paltry ten dollars' worth of

powder and shot.  He convicted him before a sheik and looked on while he

was punished by the terrible bastinado.  Hear him:



     "He (Mousa) was on his back in a twinkling, howling, shouting,

     screaming, but he was carried out to the piazza before the door,

     where we could see the operation, and laid face down.  One man sat

     on his back and one on his legs, the latter holding up his feet,

     while a third laid on the bare soles a rhinoceros-hide koorbash

     --["A Koorbash is Arabic for cowhide, the cow being a rhinoceros.

     It is the most cruel whip known to fame.  Heavy as lead, and

     flexible as India-rubber, usually about forty inches long and

     tapering gradually from an inch in diameter to a point, it

     administers a blow which leaves its mark for time."--Scow Life in

     Egypt, by the same author.]--that whizzed through the air at every

     stroke.  Poor Moreright was in agony, and Nama and Nama the Second

     (mother and sister of Mousa,) were on their faces begging and

     wailing, now embracing my knees and now Whitely's, while the

     brother, outside, made the air ring with cries louder than Mousa's.

     Even Yusef came and asked me on his knees to relent, and last of

     all, Betuni--the rascal had lost a feed-bag in their house and had

     been loudest in his denunciations that morning--besought the Howajji

     to have mercy on the fellow."



But not he!  The punishment was "suspended," at the fifteenth blow to

hear the confession.  Then Grimes and his party rode away, and left the

entire Christian family to be fined and as severely punished as the

Mohammedan sheik should deem proper.



     "As I mounted, Yusef once more begged me to interfere and have mercy

     on them, but I looked around at the dark faces of the crowd, and I

     couldn't find one drop of pity in my heart for them."



He closes his picture with a rollicking burst of humor which contrasts

finely with the grief of the mother and her children.



One more paragraph:



     "Then once more I bowed my head.  It is no shame to have wept in

     Palestine.  I wept, when I saw Jerusalem, I wept when I lay in the

     starlight at Bethlehem.  I wept on the blessed shores of Galilee.

     My hand was no less firm on the rein, my anger did not tremble on

     the trigger of my pistol when I rode with it in my right hand along

     the shore of the blue sea" (weeping.) "My eye was not dimmed by

     those tears nor my heart in aught weakened.  Let him who would sneer

     at my emotion close this volume here, for he will find little to his

     taste in my journeyings through Holy Land."



He never bored but he struck water.



I am aware that this is a pretty voluminous notice of Mr. Grimes' book.

However, it is proper and legitimate to speak of it, for "Nomadic Life in

Palestine" is a representative book--the representative of a class of

Palestine books--and a criticism upon it will serve for a criticism upon

them all.  And since I am treating it in the comprehensive capacity of a

representative book, I have taken the liberty of giving to both book and

author fictitious names.  Perhaps it is in better taste, any how, to do

this.









CHAPTER LI.



Nazareth is wonderfully interesting because the town has an air about it

of being precisely as Jesus left it, and one finds himself saying, all

the time, "The boy Jesus has stood in this doorway--has played in that

street--has touched these stones with his hands--has rambled over these

chalky hills."  Whoever shall write the boyhood of Jesus ingeniously will

make a book which will possess a vivid interest for young and old alike.

I judge so from the greater interest we found in Nazareth than any of our

speculations upon Capernaum and the Sea of Galilee gave rise to.  It was

not possible, standing by the Sea of Galilee, to frame more than a vague,

far-away idea of the majestic Personage who walked upon the crested waves

as if they had been solid earth, and who touched the dead and they rose

up and spoke.  I read among my notes, now, with a new interest, some

sentences from an edition of 1621 of the Apocryphal New Testament.

[Extract.]



     "Christ, kissed by a bride made dumb by sorcerers, cures her.  A

     leprous girl cured by the water in which the infant Christ was

     washed, and becomes the servant of Joseph and Mary.  The leprous son

     of a Prince cured in like manner.



     "A young man who had been bewitched and turned into a mule,

     miraculously cured by the infant Savior being put on his back, and

     is married to the girl who had been cured of leprosy.  Whereupon the

     bystanders praise God.



     "Chapter 16.  Christ miraculously widens or contracts gates, milk-

     pails, sieves or boxes, not properly made by Joseph, he not being

     skillful at his carpenter's trade.  The King of Jerusalem gives

     Joseph an order for a throne.  Joseph works on it for two years and

     makes it two spans too short.  The King being angry with him, Jesus

     comforts him--commands him to pull one side of the throne while he

     pulls the other, and brings it to its proper dimensions.



     "Chapter 19.  Jesus, charged with throwing a boy from the roof of a

     house, miraculously causes the dead boy to speak and acquit him;

     fetches water for his mother, breaks the pitcher and miraculously

     gathers the water in his mantle and brings it home.



     "Sent to a schoolmaster, refuses to tell his letters, and the

     schoolmaster going to whip him, his hand withers."



Further on in this quaint volume of rejected gospels is an epistle of St.

Clement to the Corinthians, which was used in the churches and considered

genuine fourteen or fifteen hundred years ago.  In it this account of the

fabled phoenix occurs:



     "1.  Let us consider that wonderful type of the resurrection, which

     is seen in the Eastern countries, that is to say, in Arabia.



     "2.  There is a certain bird called a phoenix.  Of this there is

     never but one at a time, and that lives five hundred years.  And

     when the time of its dissolution draws near, that it must die, it

     makes itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh, and other spices,

     into which, when its time is fulfilled, it enters and dies.



     "3.  But its flesh, putrefying, breeds a certain worm, which, being

     nourished by the juice of the dead bird, brings forth feathers; and

     when it is grown to a perfect state, it takes up the nest in which

     the bones of its parent lie, and carries it from Arabia into Egypt,

     to a city called Heliopolis:



     "4.  And flying in open day in the sight of all men, lays it upon

     the altar of the sun, and so returns from whence it came.



     "5.  The priests then search into the records of the time, and find

     that it returned precisely at the end of five hundred years."



Business is business, and there is nothing like punctuality, especially

in a phoenix.



The few chapters relating to the infancy of the Saviour contain many

things which seem frivolous and not worth preserving.  A large part of

the remaining portions of the book read like good Scripture, however.

There is one verse that ought not to have been rejected, because it so

evidently prophetically refers to the general run of Congresses of the

United States:



     "199.  They carry themselves high, and as prudent men; and though

     they are fools, yet would seem to be teachers."



I have set these extracts down, as I found them.  Everywhere among the

cathedrals of France and Italy, one finds traditions of personages that

do not figure in the Bible, and of miracles that are not mentioned in its

pages.  But they are all in this Apocryphal New Testament, and though

they have been ruled out of our modern Bible, it is claimed that they

were accepted gospel twelve or fifteen centuries ago, and ranked as high

in credit as any.  One needs to read this book before he visits those

venerable cathedrals, with their treasures of tabooed and forgotten

tradition.



They imposed another pirate upon us at Nazareth--another invincible Arab

guard.  We took our last look at the city, clinging like a whitewashed

wasp's nest to the hill-side, and at eight o'clock in the morning

departed.  We dismounted and drove the horses down a bridle-path which I

think was fully as crooked as a corkscrew, which I know to be as steep as

the downward sweep of a rainbow, and which I believe to be the worst

piece of road in the geography, except one in the Sandwich Islands, which

I remember painfully, and possibly one or two mountain trails in the

Sierra Nevadas.  Often, in this narrow path the horse had to poise

himself nicely on a rude stone step and then drop his fore-feet over the

edge and down something more than half his own height.  This brought his

nose near the ground, while his tail pointed up toward the sky somewhere,

and gave him the appearance of preparing to stand on his head.  A horse

cannot look dignified in this position.  We accomplished the long descent

at last, and trotted across the great Plain of Esdraelon.



Some of us will be shot before we finish this pilgrimage.  The pilgrims

read "Nomadic Life" and keep themselves in a constant state of Quixotic

heroism.  They have their hands on their pistols all the time, and every

now and then, when you least expect it, they snatch them out and take aim

at Bedouins who are not visible, and draw their knives and make savage

passes at other Bedouins who do not exist.  I am in deadly peril always,

for these spasms are sudden and irregular, and of course I cannot tell

when to be getting out of the way.  If I am accidentally murdered, some

time, during one of these romantic frenzies of the pilgrims, Mr. Grimes

must be rigidly held to answer as an accessory before the fact.  If the

pilgrims would take deliberate aim and shoot at a man, it would be all

right and proper--because that man would not be in any danger; but these

random assaults are what I object to.  I do not wish to see any more

places like Esdraelon, where the ground is level and people can gallop.

It puts melodramatic nonsense into the pilgrims' heads.  All at once,

when one is jogging along stupidly in the sun, and thinking about

something ever so far away, here they come, at a stormy gallop, spurring

and whooping at those ridgy old sore-backed plugs till their heels fly

higher than their heads, and as they whiz by, out comes a little potato-

gum of a revolver, there is a startling little pop, and a small pellet

goes singing through the air.  Now that I have begun this pilgrimage, I

intend to go through with it, though sooth to say, nothing but the most

desperate valor has kept me to my purpose up to the present time.  I do

not mind Bedouins,--I am not afraid of them; because neither Bedouins nor

ordinary Arabs have shown any disposition to harm us, but I do feel

afraid of my own comrades.



Arriving at the furthest verge of the Plain, we rode a little way up a

hill and found ourselves at Endor, famous for its witch.  Her descendants

are there yet.  They were the wildest horde of half-naked savages we have

found thus far.  They swarmed out of mud bee-hives; out of hovels of the

dry-goods box pattern; out of gaping caves under shelving rocks; out of

crevices in the earth.  In five minutes the dead solitude and silence of

the place were no more, and a begging, screeching, shouting mob were

struggling about the horses' feet and blocking the way.  "Bucksheesh!

bucksheesh!  bucksheesh!  howajji, bucksheesh!"  It was Magdala over

again, only here the glare from the infidel eyes was fierce and full of

hate.  The population numbers two hundred and fifty, and more than half

the citizens live in caves in the rock.  Dirt, degradation and savagery

are Endor's specialty.  We say no more about Magdala and Deburieh now.

Endor heads the list.  It is worse than any Indian 'campoodie'.  The hill

is barren, rocky, and forbidding.  No sprig of grass is visible, and only

one tree.  This is a fig-tree, which maintains a precarious footing among

the rocks at the mouth of the dismal cavern once occupied by the

veritable Witch of Endor.  In this cavern, tradition says, Saul, the

king, sat at midnight, and stared and trembled, while the earth shook,

the thunders crashed among the hills, and out of the midst of fire and

smoke the spirit of the dead prophet rose up and confronted him.  Saul

had crept to this place in the darkness, while his army slept, to learn

what fate awaited him in the morrow's battle.  He went away a sad man, to

meet disgrace and death.



A spring trickles out of the rock in the gloomy recesses of the cavern,

and we were thirsty.  The citizens of Endor objected to our going in

there.  They do not mind dirt; they do not mind rags; they do not mind

vermin; they do not mind barbarous ignorance and savagery; they do not

mind a reasonable degree of starvation, but they do like to be pure and

holy before their god, whoever he may be, and therefore they shudder and

grow almost pale at the idea of Christian lips polluting a spring whose

waters must descend into their sanctified gullets.  We had no wanton

desire to wound even their feelings or trample upon their prejudices, but

we were out of water, thus early in the day, and were burning up with

thirst.  It was at this time, and under these circumstances, that I

framed an aphorism which has already become celebrated.  I said:

"Necessity knows no law."  We went in and drank.



We got away from the noisy wretches, finally, dropping them in squads and

couples as we filed over the hills--the aged first, the infants next, the

young girls further on; the strong men ran beside us a mile, and only

left when they had secured the last possible piastre in the way of

bucksheesh.



In an hour, we reached Nain, where Christ raised the widow's son to life.

Nain is Magdala on a small scale.  It has no population of any

consequence.  Within a hundred yards of it is the original graveyard, for

aught I know; the tombstones lie flat on the ground, which is Jewish

fashion in Syria.  I believe the Moslems do not allow them to have

upright tombstones.  A Moslem grave is usually roughly plastered over and

whitewashed, and has at one end an upright projection which is shaped

into exceedingly rude attempts at ornamentation.  In the cities, there is

often no appearance of a grave at all; a tall, slender marble tombstone,

elaborately lettred, gilded and painted, marks the burial place, and this

is surmounted by a turban, so carved and shaped as to signify the dead

man's rank in life.



They showed a fragment of ancient wall which they said was one side of

the gate out of which the widow's dead son was being brought so many

centuries ago when Jesus met the procession:



     "Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold there was a

     dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a

     widow: and much people of the city was with her.



     "And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said, Weep

     not.



     "And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood

     still.  And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, arise.



     "And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.  And he delivered

     him to his mother.



     "And there came a fear on all.  And they glorified God, saying, That

     a great prophet is risen up among us; and That God hath visited his

     people."



A little mosque stands upon the spot which tradition says was occupied by

the widow's dwelling.  Two or three aged Arabs sat about its door.  We

entered, and the pilgrims broke specimens from the foundation walls,

though they had to touch, and even step, upon the "praying carpets" to do

it.  It was almost the same as breaking pieces from the hearts of those

old Arabs.  To step rudely upon the sacred praying mats, with booted

feet--a thing not done by any Arab--was to inflict pain upon men who had

not offended us in any way.  Suppose a party of armed foreigners were to

enter a village church in America and break ornaments from the altar

railings for curiosities, and climb up and walk upon the Bible and the

pulpit cushions?  However, the cases are different.  One is the

profanation of a temple of our faith--the other only the profanation of a

pagan one.



We descended to the Plain again, and halted a moment at a well--of

Abraham's time, no doubt.  It was in a desert place.  It was walled three

feet above ground with squared and heavy blocks of stone, after the

manner of Bible pictures.  Around it some camels stood, and others knelt.

There was a group of sober little donkeys with naked, dusky children

clambering about them, or sitting astride their rumps, or pulling their

tails.  Tawny, black-eyed, barefooted maids, arrayed in rags and adorned

with brazen armlets and pinchbeck ear-rings, were poising water-jars upon

their heads, or drawing water from the well.  A flock of sheep stood by,

waiting for the shepherds to fill the hollowed stones with water, so that

they might drink--stones which, like those that walled the well, were

worn smooth and deeply creased by the chafing chins of a hundred

generations of thirsty animals.  Picturesque Arabs sat upon the ground,

in groups, and solemnly smoked their long-stemmed chibouks.  Other Arabs

were filling black hog-skins with water--skins which, well filled, and

distended with water till the short legs projected painfully out of the

proper line, looked like the corpses of hogs bloated by drowning.  Here

was a grand Oriental picture which I had worshiped a thousand times in

soft, rich steel engravings!  But in the engraving there was no

desolation; no dirt; no rags; no fleas; no ugly features; no sore eyes;

no feasting flies; no besotted ignorance in the countenances; no raw

places on the donkeys' backs; no disagreeable jabbering in unknown

tongues; no stench of camels; no suggestion that a couple of tons of

powder placed under the party and touched off would heighten the effect

and give to the scene a genuine interest and a charm which it would

always be pleasant to recall, even though a man lived a thousand years.

Oriental scenes look best in steel engravings.  I cannot be imposed upon

any more by that picture of the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon.  I shall

say to myself, You look fine, Madam but your feet are not clean and you

smell like a camel.



Presently a wild Arab in charge of a camel train recognized an old friend

in Ferguson, and they ran and fell upon each other's necks and kissed

each other's grimy, bearded faces upon both cheeks.  It explained

instantly a something which had always seemed to me only a farfetched

Oriental figure of speech.  I refer to the circumstance of Christ's

rebuking a Pharisee, or some such character, and reminding him that from

him he had received no "kiss of welcome."  It did not seem reasonable to

me that men should kiss each other, but I am aware, now, that they did.

There was reason in it, too.  The custom was natural and proper; because

people must kiss, and a man would not be likely to kiss one of the women

of this country of his own free will and accord.  One must travel, to

learn.  Every day, now, old Scriptural phrases that never possessed any

significance for me before, take to themselves a meaning.



We journeyed around the base of the mountain--"Little Hermon,"--past the

old Crusaders' castle of El Fuleh, and arrived at Shunem.  This was

another Magdala, to a fraction, frescoes and all.  Here, tradition says,

the prophet Samuel was born, and here the Shunamite woman built a little

house upon the city wall for the accommodation of the prophet Elisha.

Elisha asked her what she expected in return.  It was a perfectly natural

question, for these people are and were in the habit of proffering favors

and services and then expecting and begging for pay.  Elisha knew them

well.  He could not comprehend that any body should build for him that

humble little chamber for the mere sake of old friendship, and with no

selfish motive whatever.  It used to seem a very impolite, not to say a

rude, question, for Elisha to ask the woman, but it does not seem so to

me now.  The woman said she expected nothing.  Then for her goodness and

her unselfishness, he rejoiced her heart with the news that she should

bear a son.  It was a high reward--but she would not have thanked him for

a daughter--daughters have always been unpopular here.  The son was born,

grew, waxed strong, died.  Elisha restored him to life in Shunem.



We found here a grove of lemon trees--cool, shady, hung with fruit.  One

is apt to overestimate beauty when it is rare, but to me this grove

seemed very beautiful.  It was beautiful.  I do not overestimate it.  I

must always remember Shunem gratefully, as a place which gave to us this

leafy shelter after our long, hot ride.  We lunched, rested, chatted,

smoked our pipes an hour, and then mounted and moved on.



As we trotted across the Plain of Jezreel, we met half a dozen Digger

Indians (Bedouins) with very long spears in their hands, cavorting around

on old crowbait horses, and spearing imaginary enemies; whooping, and

fluttering their rags in the wind, and carrying on in every respect like

a pack of hopeless lunatics.  At last, here were the "wild, free sons of

the desert, speeding over the plain like the wind, on their beautiful

Arabian mares" we had read so much about and longed so much to see!  Here

were the "picturesque costumes!"  This was the "gallant spectacle!"

Tatterdemalion vagrants--cheap braggadocio--"Arabian mares" spined and

necked like the ichthyosaurus in the museum, and humped and cornered like

a dromedary!  To glance at the genuine son of the desert is to take the

romance out of him forever--to behold his steed is to long in charity to

strip his harness off and let him fall to pieces.



Presently we came to a ruinous old town on a hill, the same being the

ancient Jezreel.



Ahab, King of Samaria, (this was a very vast kingdom, for those days, and

was very nearly half as large as Rhode Island) dwelt in the city of

Jezreel, which was his capital.  Near him lived a man by the name of

Naboth, who had a vineyard.  The King asked him for it, and when he would

not give it, offered to buy it.  But Naboth refused to sell it.  In those

days it was considered a sort of crime to part with one's inheritance at

any price--and even if a man did part with it, it reverted to himself or

his heirs again at the next jubilee year.  So this spoiled child of a

King went and lay down on the bed with his face to the wall, and grieved

sorely.  The Queen, a notorious character in those days, and whose name

is a by-word and a reproach even in these, came in and asked him

wherefore he sorrowed, and he told her.  Jezebel said she could secure

the vineyard; and she went forth and forged letters to the nobles and

wise men, in the King's name, and ordered them to proclaim a fast and set

Naboth on high before the people, and suborn two witnesses to swear that

he had blasphemed.  They did it, and the people stoned the accused by the

city wall, and he died.  Then Jezebel came and told the King, and said,

Behold, Naboth is no more--rise up and seize the vineyard.  So Ahab

seized the vineyard, and went into it to possess it.  But the Prophet

Elijah came to him there and read his fate to him, and the fate of

Jezebel; and said that in the place where dogs licked the blood of

Naboth, dogs should also lick his blood--and he said, likewise, the dogs

should eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.  In the course of time, the

King was killed in battle, and when his chariot wheels were washed in the

pool of Samaria, the dogs licked the blood.  In after years, Jehu, who

was King of Israel, marched down against Jezreel, by order of one of the

Prophets, and administered one of those convincing rebukes so common

among the people of those days: he killed many kings and their subjects,

and as he came along he saw Jezebel, painted and finely dressed, looking

out of a window, and ordered that she be thrown down to him.  A servant

did it, and Jehu's horse trampled her under foot.  Then Jehu went in and

sat down to dinner; and presently he said, Go and bury this cursed woman,

for she is a King's daughter.  The spirit of charity came upon him too

late, however, for the prophecy had already been fulfilled--the dogs had

eaten her, and they "found no more of her than the skull, and the feet,

and the palms of her hands."



Ahab, the late King, had left a helpless family behind him, and Jehu

killed seventy of the orphan sons.  Then he killed all the relatives, and

teachers, and servants and friends of the family, and rested from his

labors, until he was come near to Samaria, where he met forty-two persons

and asked them who they were; they said they were brothers of the King of

Judah.  He killed them.  When he got to Samaria, he said he would show

his zeal for the Lord; so he gathered all the priests and people together

that worshiped Baal, pretending that he was going to adopt that worship

and offer up a great sacrifice; and when they were all shut up where they

could not defend themselves, he caused every person of them to be killed.

Then Jehu, the good missionary, rested from his labors once more.



We went back to the valley, and rode to the Fountain of Ain Jelud.  They

call it the Fountain of Jezreel, usually.  It is a pond about one hundred

feet square and four feet deep, with a stream of water trickling into it

from under an overhanging ledge of rocks.  It is in the midst of a great

solitude.  Here Gideon pitched his camp in the old times; behind Shunem

lay the "Midianites, the Amalekites, and the Children of the East," who

were "as grasshoppers for multitude; both they and their camels were

without number, as the sand by the sea-side for multitude."  Which means

that there were one hundred and thirty-five thousand men, and that they

had transportation service accordingly.



Gideon, with only three hundred men, surprised them in the night, and

stood by and looked on while they butchered each other until a hundred

and twenty thousand lay dead on the field.



We camped at Jenin before night, and got up and started again at one

o'clock in the morning.  Somewhere towards daylight we passed the

locality where the best authenticated tradition locates the pit into

which Joseph's brethren threw him, and about noon, after passing over a

succession of mountain tops, clad with groves of fig and olive trees,

with the Mediterranean in sight some forty miles away, and going by many

ancient Biblical cities whose inhabitants glowered savagely upon our

Christian procession, and were seemingly inclined to practice on it with

stones, we came to the singularly terraced and unlovely hills that

betrayed that we were out of Galilee and into Samaria at last.



We climbed a high hill to visit the city of Samaria, where the woman may

have hailed from who conversed with Christ at Jacob's Well, and from

whence, no doubt, came also the celebrated Good Samaritan.  Herod the

Great is said to have made a magnificent city of this place, and a great

number of coarse limestone columns, twenty feet high and two feet

through, that are almost guiltless of architectural grace of shape and

ornament, are pointed out by many authors as evidence of the fact.  They

would not have been considered handsome in ancient Greece, however.



The inhabitants of this camp are particularly vicious, and stoned two

parties of our pilgrims a day or two ago who brought about the difficulty

by showing their revolvers when they did not intend to use them--a thing

which is deemed bad judgment in the Far West, and ought certainly to be

so considered any where.  In the new Territories, when a man puts his

hand on a weapon, he knows that he must use it; he must use it instantly

or expect to be shot down where he stands.  Those pilgrims had been

reading Grimes.



There was nothing for us to do in Samaria but buy handfuls of old Roman

coins at a franc a dozen, and look at a dilapidated church of the

Crusaders and a vault in it which once contained the body of John the

Baptist.  This relic was long ago carried away to Genoa.



Samaria stood a disastrous siege, once, in the days of Elisha, at the

hands of the King of Syria.  Provisions reached such a figure that "an

ass' head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a

cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver."



An incident recorded of that heavy time will give one a very good idea of

the distress that prevailed within these crumbling walls.  As the King

was walking upon the battlements one day, "a woman cried out, saying,

Help, my lord, O King!  And the King said, What aileth thee?  and she

answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-

day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.  So we boiled my son, and did eat

him; and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat

him; and she hath hid her son."



The prophet Elisha declared that within four and twenty hours the prices

of food should go down to nothing, almost, and it was so.  The Syrian

army broke camp and fled, for some cause or other, the famine was

relieved from without, and many a shoddy speculator in dove's dung and

ass's meat was ruined.



We were glad to leave this hot and dusty old village and hurry on.  At

two o'clock we stopped to lunch and rest at ancient Shechem, between the

historic Mounts of Gerizim and Ebal, where in the old times the books of

the law, the curses and the blessings, were read from the heights to the

Jewish multitudes below.









CHAPTER LII.



The narrow canon in which Nablous, or Shechem, is situated, is under high

cultivation, and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile.  It is well

watered, and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with the

barren hills that tower on either side.  One of these hills is the

ancient Mount of Blessings and the other the Mount of Curses and wise men

who seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder of

this kind--to wit, that the Mount of Blessings is strangely fertile and

its mate as strangely unproductive.  We could not see that there was

really much difference between them in this respect, however.



Shechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch Jacob,

and as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from their

brethren of Israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with those

of the original Jewish creed.  For thousands of years this clan have

dwelt in Shechem under strict tabu, and having little commerce or

fellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality.  For

generations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred, but they

still adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rites and

ceremonies.  Talk of family and old descent!  Princes and nobles pride

themselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of years.

What is this trifle to this handful of old first families of Shechem who

can name their fathers straight back without a flaw for thousands--

straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a country where

the days of two hundred years ago are called "ancient" times grow dazed

and bewildered when they try to comprehend it!  Here is respectability

for you--here is "family"--here is high descent worth talking about.

This sad, proud remnant of a once mighty community still hold themselves

aloof from all the world; they still live as their fathers lived, labor

as their fathers labored, think as they did, feel as they did, worship in

the same place, in sight of the same landmarks, and in the same quaint,

patriarchal way their ancestors did more than thirty centuries ago.  I

found myself gazing at any straggling scion of this strange race with a

riveted fascination, just as one would stare at a living mastodon, or a

megatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of creation and seen the

wonders of that mysterious world that was before the flood.



Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community

is a MSS.  copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldest

document on earth.  It is written on vellum, and is some four or five

thousand years old.  Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight.  Its

fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts so

many authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast

upon it.  Speaking of this MSS. reminds me that I procured from the high-

priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a secret

document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary interest,

which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished translating it.



Joshua gave his dying injunction to the children of Israel at Shechem,

and buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there about the

same time.  The superstitious Samaritans have always been afraid to hunt

for it.  They believe it is guarded by fierce spirits invisible to men.



About a mile and a half from Shechem we halted at the base of Mount Ebal

before a little square area, inclosed by a high stone wall, neatly

whitewashed.  Across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after the

manner of the Moslems.  It is the tomb of Joseph.  No truth is better

authenticated than this.



When Joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the Israelites from

Egypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards.  At the same time he

exacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the land of

Canaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the ancient

inheritance of his fathers.  The oath was kept. "And the bones of Joseph,

which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in

Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor

the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver."



Few tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men of

divers creeds as this of Joseph.  "Samaritan and Jew, Moslem and

Christian alike, revere it, and honor it with their visits.  The tomb of

Joseph, the dutiful son, the affectionate, forgiving brother, the

virtuous man, the wise Prince and ruler.  Egypt felt his influence--the

world knows his history."



In this same "parcel of ground" which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor

for a hundred pieces of silver, is Jacob's celebrated well.  It is cut in

the solid rock, and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep.  The name

of this unpretending hole in the ground, which one might pass by and take

no notice of, is as familiar as household words to even the children and

the peasants of many a far-off country.  It is more famous than the

Parthenon; it is older than the Pyramids.



It was by this well that Jesus sat and talked with a woman of that

strange, antiquated Samaritan community I have been speaking of, and told

her of the mysterious water of life.  As descendants of old English

nobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this king

or that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred years

ago, no doubt the descendants of the woman of Samaria, living there in

Shechem, still refer with pardonable vanity to this conversation of their

ancestor, held some little time gone by, with the Messiah of the

Christians.  It is not likely that they undervalue a distinction such as

this.  Samaritan nature is human nature, and human nature remembers

contact with the illustrious, always.



For an offense done to the family honor, the sons of Jacob exterminated

all Shechem once.



We left Jacob's Well and traveled till eight in the evening, but rather

slowly, for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours, and the horses were

cruelly tired.  We got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp in

an Arab village, and sleep on the ground.  We could have slept in the

largest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it was

populous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly,

and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys in

the parlor.  Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky,

ragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages grouped

themselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and

criticised us with noisy tongues till midnight.  We did not mind the

noise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almost

an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are looking

at you.  We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started once

more.  Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition in

life is to get ahead of each other.



About daylight we passed Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant rested

three hundred years, and at whose gates good old Eli fell down and "brake

his neck" when the messenger, riding hard from the battle, told him of

the defeat of his people, the death of his sons, and, more than all, the

capture of Israel's pride, her hope, her refuge, the ancient Ark her

forefathers brought with them out of Egypt.  It is little wonder that

under circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck.  But

Shiloh had no charms for us.  We were so cold that there was no comfort

but in motion, and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses.



After a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins, which still bears the

name of Bethel.  It was here that Jacob lay down and had that superb

vision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from the

clouds to earth, and caught glimpses of their blessed home through the

open gates of Heaven.



The pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin, and we pressed on

toward the goal of our crusade, renowned Jerusalem.



The further we went the hotter the sun got, and the more rocky and bare,

repulsive and dreary the landscape became.  There could not have been

more fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world, if

every ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a separate and

distinct stonecutter's establishment for an age.  There was hardly a tree

or a shrub any where.  Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends

of a worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.  No landscape

exists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds the

approaches to Jerusalem.  The only difference between the roads and the

surrounding country, perhaps, is that there are rather more rocks in the

roads than in the surrounding country.



We passed Ramah, and Beroth, and on the right saw the tomb of the prophet

Samuel, perched high upon a commanding eminence.  Still no Jerusalem came

in sight.  We hurried on impatiently.  We halted a moment at the ancient

Fountain of Beira, but its stones, worn deeply by the chins of thirsty

animals that are dead and gone centuries ago, had no interest for us--we

longed to see Jerusalem.  We spurred up hill after hill, and usually

began to stretch our necks minutes before we got to the top--but

disappointment always followed:--more stupid hills beyond--more unsightly

landscape--no Holy City.



At last, away in the middle of the day, ancient bite of wall and

crumbling arches began to line the way--we toiled up one more hill, and

every pilgrim and every sinner swung his hat on high!  Jerusalem!



Perched on its eternal hills, white and domed and solid, massed together

and hooped with high gray walls, the venerable city gleamed in the sun.

So small!  Why, it was no larger than an American village of four

thousand inhabitants, and no larger than an ordinary Syrian city of

thirty thousand.  Jerusalem numbers only fourteen thousand people.



We dismounted and looked, without speaking a dozen sentences, across the

wide intervening valley for an hour or more; and noted those prominent

features of the city that pictures make familiar to all men from their

school days till their death.  We could recognize the Tower of Hippicus,

the Mosque of Omar, the Damascus Gate, the Mount of Olives, the Valley of

Jehoshaphat, the Tower of David, and the Garden of Gethsemane--and dating

from these landmarks could tell very nearly the localities of many others

we were not able to distinguish.



I record it here as a notable but not discreditable fact that not even

our pilgrims wept.  I think there was no individual in the party whose

brain was not teeming with thoughts and images and memories invoked by

the grand history of the venerable city that lay before us, but still

among them all was no "voice of them that wept."



There was no call for tears.  Tears would have been out of place.  The

thoughts Jerusalem suggests are full of poetry, sublimity, and more than

all, dignity.  Such thoughts do not find their appropriate expression in

the emotions of the nursery.



Just after noon we entered these narrow, crooked streets, by the ancient

and the famed Damascus Gate, and now for several hours I have been trying

to comprehend that I am actually in the illustrious old city where

Solomon dwelt, where Abraham held converse with the Deity, and where

walls still stand that witnessed the spectacle of the Crucifixion.









CHAPTER LIII.



A fast walker could go outside the walls of Jerusalem and walk entirely

around the city in an hour.  I do not know how else to make one

understand how small it is.  The appearance of the city is peculiar.  It

is as knobby with countless little domes as a prison door is with bolt-

heads.  Every house has from one to half a dozen of these white plastered

domes of stone, broad and low, sitting in the centre of, or in a cluster

upon, the flat roof.  Wherefore, when one looks down from an eminence,

upon the compact mass of houses (so closely crowded together, in fact,

that there is no appearance of streets at all, and so the city looks

solid,) he sees the knobbiest town in the world, except Constantinople.

It looks as if it might be roofed, from centre to circumference, with

inverted saucers.  The monotony of the view is interrupted only by the

great Mosque of Omar, the Tower of Hippicus, and one or two other

buildings that rise into commanding prominence.



The houses are generally two stories high, built strongly of masonry,

whitewashed or plastered outside, and have a cage of wooden lattice-work

projecting in front of every window.  To reproduce a Jerusalem street, it

would only be necessary to up-end a chicken-coop and hang it before each

window in an alley of American houses.



The streets are roughly and badly paved with stone, and are tolerably

crooked--enough so to make each street appear to close together

constantly and come to an end about a hundred yards ahead of a pilgrim as

long as he chooses to walk in it.  Projecting from the top of the lower

story of many of the houses is a very narrow porch-roof or shed, without

supports from below; and I have several times seen cats jump across the

street from one shed to the other when they were out calling.  The cats

could have jumped double the distance without extraordinary exertion.  I

mention these things to give an idea of how narrow the streets are.

Since a cat can jump across them without the least inconvenience, it is

hardly necessary to state that such streets are too narrow for carriages.

These vehicles cannot navigate the Holy City.



The population of Jerusalem is composed of Moslems, Jews, Greeks, Latins,

Armenians, Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics, and a handful of

Protestants.  One hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now in

this birthplace of Christianity.  The nice shades of nationality

comprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, are

altogether too numerous to mention.  It seems to me that all the races

and colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among the

fourteen thousand souls that dwell in Jerusalem.  Rags, wretchedness,

poverty and dirt, those signs and symbols that indicate the presence of

Moslem rule more surely than the crescent-flag itself, abound.  Lepers,

cripples, the blind, and the idiotic, assail you on every hand, and they

know but one word of but one language apparently--the eternal

"bucksheesh."  To see the numbers of maimed, malformed and diseased

humanity that throng the holy places and obstruct the gates, one might

suppose that the ancient days had come again, and that the angel of the

Lord was expected to descend at any moment to stir the waters of

Bethesda.  Jerusalem is mournful, and dreary, and lifeless.  I would not

desire to live here.



One naturally goes first to the Holy Sepulchre.  It is right in the city,

near the western gate; it and the place of the Crucifixion, and, in fact,

every other place intimately connected with that tremendous event, are

ingeniously massed together and covered by one roof--the dome of the

Church of the Holy Sepulchre.



Entering the building, through the midst of the usual assemblage of

beggars, one sees on his left a few Turkish guards--for Christians of

different sects will not only quarrel, but fight, also, in this sacred

place, if allowed to do it.  Before you is a marble slab, which covers

the Stone of Unction, whereon the Saviour's body was laid to prepare it

for burial.  It was found necessary to conceal the real stone in this way

in order to save it from destruction.  Pilgrims were too much given to

chipping off pieces of it to carry home.  Near by is a circular railing

which marks the spot where the Virgin stood when the Lord's body was

anointed.



Entering the great Rotunda, we stand before the most sacred locality in

Christendom--the grave of Jesus.  It is in the centre of the church, and

immediately under the great dome.  It is inclosed in a sort of little

temple of yellow and white stone, of fanciful design.  Within the little

temple is a portion of the very stone which was rolled away from the door

of the Sepulchre, and on which the angel was sitting when Mary came

thither "at early dawn."  Stooping low, we enter the vault--the Sepulchre

itself.  It is only about six feet by seven, and the stone couch on which

the dead Saviour lay extends from end to end of the apartment and

occupies half its width.  It is covered with a marble slab which has been

much worn by the lips of pilgrims.  This slab serves as an altar, now.

Over it hang some fifty gold and silver lamps, which are kept always

burning, and the place is otherwise scandalized by trumpery, gewgaws, and

tawdry ornamentation.



All sects of Christians (except Protestants,) have chapels under the roof

of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and each must keep to itself and not

venture upon another's ground.  It has been proven conclusively that they

can not worship together around the grave of the Saviour of the World in

peace.  The chapel of the Syrians is not handsome; that of the Copts is

the humblest of them all.  It is nothing but a dismal cavern, roughly

hewn in the living rock of the Hill of Calvary.  In one side of it two

ancient tombs are hewn, which are claimed to be those in which Nicodemus

and Joseph of Aramathea were buried.



As we moved among the great piers and pillars of another part of the

church, we came upon a party of black-robed, animal-looking Italian

monks, with candles in their hands, who were chanting something in Latin,

and going through some kind of religious performance around a disk of

white marble let into the floor.  It was there that the risen Saviour

appeared to Mary Magdalen in the likeness of a gardener.  Near by was a

similar stone, shaped like a star--here the Magdalen herself stood, at

the same time.  Monks were performing in this place also.  They perform

everywhere--all over the vast building, and at all hours.  Their candles

are always flitting about in the gloom, and making the dim old church

more dismal than there is any necessity that it should be, even though it

is a tomb.



We were shown the place where our Lord appeared to His mother after the

Resurrection.  Here, also, a marble slab marks the place where St.

Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, found the crosses about

three hundred years after the Crucifixion.  According to the legend, this

great discovery elicited extravagant demonstrations of joy.  But they

were of short duration.  The question intruded itself: "Which bore the

blessed Saviour, and which the thieves?"  To be in doubt, in so mighty a

matter as this--to be uncertain which one to adore--was a grievous

misfortune.  It turned the public joy to sorrow.  But when lived there a

holy priest who could not set so simple a trouble as this at rest?  One

of these soon hit upon a plan that would be a certain test.  A noble lady

lay very ill in Jerusalem.  The wise priests ordered that the three

crosses be taken to her bedside one at a time.  It was done.  When her

eyes fell upon the first one, she uttered a scream that was heard beyond

the Damascus Gate, and even upon the Mount of Olives, it was said, and

then fell back in a deadly swoon.  They recovered her and brought the

second cross.  Instantly she went into fearful convulsions, and it was

with the greatest difficulty that six strong men could hold her.  They

were afraid, now, to bring in the third cross.  They began to fear that

possibly they had fallen upon the wrong crosses, and that the true cross

was not with this number at all.  However, as the woman seemed likely to

die with the convulsions that were tearing her, they concluded that the

third could do no more than put her out of her misery with a happy

dispatch.  So they brought it, and behold, a miracle!  The woman sprang

from her bed, smiling and joyful, and perfectly restored to health.  When

we listen to evidence like this, we cannot but believe.  We would be

ashamed to doubt, and properly, too.  Even the very part of Jerusalem

where this all occurred is there yet.  So there is really no room for

doubt.



The priests tried to show us, through a small screen, a fragment of the

genuine Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when they

scourged him.  But we could not see it, because it was dark inside the

screen.  However, a baton is kept here, which the pilgrim thrusts through

a hole in the screen, and then he no longer doubts that the true Pillar

of Flagellation is in there.  He can not have any excuse to doubt it, for

he can feel it with the stick.  He can feel it as distinctly as he could

feel any thing.



Not far from here was a niche where they used to preserve a piece of the

True Cross, but it is gone, now.  This piece of the cross was discovered

in the sixteenth century.  The Latin priests say it was stolen away, long

ago, by priests of another sect.  That seems like a hard statement to

make, but we know very well that it was stolen, because we have seen it

ourselves in several of the cathedrals of Italy and France.



But the relic that touched us most was the plain old sword of that stout

Crusader, Godfrey of Bulloigne--King Godfrey of Jerusalem.  No blade in

Christendom wields such enchantment as this--no blade of all that rust in

the ancestral halls of Europe is able to invoke such visions of romance

in the brain of him who looks upon it--none that can prate of such

chivalric deeds or tell such brave tales of the warrior days of old.  It

stirs within a man every memory of the Holy Wars that has been sleeping

in his brain for years, and peoples his thoughts with mail-clad images,

with marching armies, with battles and with sieges.  It speaks to him of

Baldwin, and Tancred, the princely Saladin, and great Richard of the Lion

Heart.  It was with just such blades as these that these splendid heroes

of romance used to segregate a man, so to speak, and leave the half of

him to fall one way and the other half the other.  This very sword has

cloven hundreds of Saracen Knights from crown to chin in those old times

when Godfrey wielded it.  It was enchanted, then, by a genius that was

under the command of King Solomon.  When danger approached its master's

tent it always struck the shield and clanged out a fierce alarm upon the

startled ear of night.  In times of doubt, or in fog or darkness, if it

were drawn from its sheath it would point instantly toward the foe, and

thus reveal the way--and it would also attempt to start after them of its

own accord.  A Christian could not be so disguised that it would not know

him and refuse to hurt him--nor a Moslem so disguised that it would not

leap from its scabbard and take his life.  These statements are all well

authenticated in many legends that are among the most trustworthy legends

the good old Catholic monks preserve.  I can never forget old Godfrey's

sword, now.  I tried it on a Moslem, and clove him in twain like a

doughnut.  The spirit of Grimes was upon me, and if I had had a graveyard

I would have destroyed all the infidels in Jerusalem.  I wiped the blood

off the old sword and handed it back to the priest--I did not want the

fresh gore to obliterate those sacred spots that crimsoned its brightness

one day six hundred years ago and thus gave Godfrey warning that before

the sun went down his journey of life would end.



Still moving through the gloom of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre we

came to a small chapel, hewn out of the rock--a place which has been

known as "The Prison of Our Lord" for many centuries.  Tradition says

that here the Saviour was confined just previously to the crucifixion.

Under an altar by the door was a pair of stone stocks for human legs.

These things are called the "Bonds of Christ," and the use they were once

put to has given them the name they now bear.



The Greek Chapel is the most roomy, the richest and the showiest chapel

in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Its altar, like that of all the

Greek churches, is a lofty screen that extends clear across the chapel,

and is gorgeous with gilding and pictures.  The numerous lamps that hang

before it are of gold and silver, and cost great sums.



But the feature of the place is a short column that rises from the middle

of the marble pavement of the chapel, and marks the exact centre of the

earth.  The most reliable traditions tell us that this was known to be

the earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ was upon earth he set

all doubts upon the subject at rest forever, by stating with his own lips

that the tradition was correct.  Remember, He said that that particular

column stood upon the centre of the world.  If the centre of the world

changes, the column changes its position accordingly.  This column has

moved three different times of its own accord.  This is because, in great

convulsions of nature, at three different times, masses of the earth--

whole ranges of mountains, probably--have flown off into space, thus

lessening the diameter of the earth, and changing the exact locality of

its centre by a point or two.  This is a very curious and interesting

circumstance, and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would

make us believe that it is not possible for any portion of the earth to

fly off into space.



To satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre of the earth, a

sceptic once paid well for the privilege of ascending to the dome of the

church to see if the sun gave him a shadow at noon.  He came down

perfectly convinced.  The day was very cloudy and the sun threw no

shadows at all; but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come out

and made shadows it could not have made any for him.  Proofs like these

are not to be set aside by the idle tongues of cavilers.  To such as are

not bigoted, and are willing to be convinced, they carry a conviction

that nothing can ever shake.



If even greater proofs than those I have mentioned are wanted, to satisfy

the headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuine centre of the

earth, they are here.  The greatest of them lies in the fact that from

under this very column was taken the dust from which Adam was made.  This

can surely be regarded in the light of a settler.  It is not likely that

the original first man would have been made from an inferior quality of

earth when it was entirely convenient to get first quality from the

world's centre.  This will strike any reflecting mind forcibly.  That

Adam was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply proven by the

fact that in six thousand years no man has ever been able to prove that

the dirt was not procured here whereof he was made.



It is a singular circumstance that right under the roof of this same

great church, and not far away from that illustrious column, Adam

himself, the father of the human race, lies buried.  There is no question

that he is actually buried in the grave which is pointed out as his--

there can be none--because it has never yet been proven that that grave

is not the grave in which he is buried.



The tomb of Adam!  How touching it was, here in a land of strangers, far

away from home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discover

the grave of a blood relation.  True, a distant one, but still a

relation.  The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition.  The

fountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest depths,

and I gave way to tumultuous emotion.  I leaned upon a pillar and burst

into tears.  I deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poor

dead relative.  Let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volume

here, for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through Holy

Land.  Noble old man--he did not live to see me--he did not live to see

his child.  And I--I--alas, I did not live to see him.  Weighed down by

sorrow and disappointment, he died before I was born--six thousand brief

summers before I was born.  But let us try to bear it with fortitude.

Let us trust that he is better off where he is.  Let us take comfort in

the thought that his loss is our eternal gain.



The next place the guide took us to in the holy church was an altar

dedicated to the Roman soldier who was of the military guard that

attended at the Crucifixion to keep order, and who--when the vail of the

Temple was rent in the awful darkness that followed; when the rock of

Golgotha was split asunder by an earthquake; when the artillery of heaven

thundered, and in the baleful glare of the lightnings the shrouded dead

flitted about the streets of Jerusalem--shook with fear and said, "Surely

this was the Son of God!"  Where this altar stands now, that Roman

soldier stood then, in full view of the crucified Saviour--in full sight

and hearing of all the marvels that were transpiring far and wide about

the circumference of the Hill of Calvary.  And in this self-same spot the

priests of the Temple beheaded him for those blasphemous words he had

spoken.



In this altar they used to keep one of the most curious relics that human

eyes ever looked upon--a thing that had power to fascinate the beholder

in some mysterious way and keep him gazing for hours together.  It was

nothing less than the copper plate Pilate put upon the Saviour's cross,

and upon which he wrote, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."  I think St.

Helena, the mother of Constantine, found this wonderful memento when she

was here in the third century.  She traveled all over Palestine, and was

always fortunate.  Whenever the good old enthusiast found a thing

mentioned in her Bible, Old or New, she would go and search for that

thing, and never stop until she found it.  If it was Adam, she would find

Adam; if it was the Ark, she would find the Ark; if it was Goliath, or

Joshua, she would find them.  She found the inscription here that I was

speaking of, I think.  She found it in this very spot, close to where the

martyred Roman soldier stood.  That copper plate is in one of the

churches in Rome, now.  Any one can see it there.  The inscription is

very distinct.



We passed along a few steps and saw the altar built over the very spot

where the good Catholic priests say the soldiers divided the raiment of

the Saviour.



Then we went down into a cavern which cavilers say was once a cistern.

It is a chapel, now, however--the Chapel of St. Helena.  It is fifty-one

feet long by forty-three wide.  In it is a marble chair which Helena used

to sit in while she superintended her workmen when they were digging and

delving for the True Cross.  In this place is an altar dedicated to St.

Dimas, the penitent thief.  A new bronze statue is here--a statue of St.

Helena.  It reminded us of poor Maximilian, so lately shot.  He presented

it to this chapel when he was about to leave for his throne in Mexico.



From the cistern we descended twelve steps into a large roughly-shaped

grotto, carved wholly out of the living rock.  Helena blasted it out when

she was searching for the true Cross.  She had a laborious piece of work,

here, but it was richly rewarded.  Out of this place she got the crown of

thorns, the nails of the cross, the true Cross itself, and the cross of

the penitent thief.  When she thought she had found every thing and was

about to stop, she was told in a dream to continue a day longer.  It was

very fortunate.  She did so, and found the cross of the other thief.



The walls and roof of this grotto still weep bitter tears in memory of

the event that transpired on Calvary, and devout pilgrims groan and sob

when these sad tears fall upon them from the dripping rock.  The monks

call this apartment the "Chapel of the Invention of the Cross"--a name

which is unfortunate, because it leads the ignorant to imagine that a

tacit acknowledgment is thus made that the tradition that Helena found

the true Cross here is a fiction--an invention.  It is a happiness to

know, however, that intelligent people do not doubt the story in any of

its particulars.



Priests of any of the chapels and denominations in the Church of the Holy

Sepulchre can visit this sacred grotto to weep and pray and worship the

gentle Redeemer.  Two different congregations are not allowed to enter at

the same time, however, because they always fight.



Still marching through the venerable Church of the Holy Sepulchre, among

chanting priests in coarse long robes and sandals; pilgrims of all colors

and many nationalities, in all sorts of strange costumes; under dusky

arches and by dingy piers and columns; through a sombre cathedral gloom

freighted with smoke and incense, and faintly starred with scores of

candles that appeared suddenly and as suddenly disappeared, or drifted

mysteriously hither and thither about the distant aisles like ghostly

jack-o'-lanterns--we came at last to a small chapel which is called the

"Chapel of the Mocking."  Under the altar was a fragment of a marble

column; this was the seat Christ sat on when he was reviled, and

mockingly made King, crowned with a crown of thorns and sceptred with a

reed.  It was here that they blindfolded him and struck him, and said in

derision, "Prophesy who it is that smote thee."  The tradition that this

is the identical spot of the mocking is a very ancient one.  The guide

said that Saewulf was the first to mention it.  I do not know Saewulf,

but still, I cannot well refuse to receive his evidence--none of us can.



They showed us where the great Godfrey and his brother Baldwin, the first

Christian Kings of Jerusalem, once lay buried by that sacred sepulchre

they had fought so long and so valiantly to wrest from the hands of the

infidel.  But the niches that had contained the ashes of these renowned

crusaders were empty.  Even the coverings of their tombs were gone--

destroyed by devout members of the Greek Church, because Godfrey and

Baldwin were Latin princes, and had been reared in a Christian faith

whose creed differed in some unimportant respects from theirs.



We passed on, and halted before the tomb of Melchisedek!  You will

remember Melchisedek, no doubt; he was the King who came out and levied a

tribute on Abraham the time that he pursued Lot's captors to Dan, and

took all their property from them.  That was about four thousand years

ago, and Melchisedek died shortly afterward.  However, his tomb is in a

good state of preservation.



When one enters the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Sepulchre itself is

the first thing he desires to see, and really is almost the first thing

he does see.  The next thing he has a strong yearning to see is the spot

where the Saviour was crucified.  But this they exhibit last.  It is the

crowning glory of the place.  One is grave and thoughtful when he stands

in the little Tomb of the Saviour--he could not well be otherwise in such

a place--but he has not the slightest possible belief that ever the Lord

lay there, and so the interest he feels in the spot is very, very greatly

marred by that reflection.  He looks at the place where Mary stood, in

another part of the church, and where John stood, and Mary Magdalen;

where the mob derided the Lord; where the angel sat; where the crown of

thorns was found, and the true Cross; where the risen Saviour appeared--

he looks at all these places with interest, but with the same conviction

he felt in the case of the Sepulchre, that there is nothing genuine about

them, and that they are imaginary holy places created by the monks.  But

the place of the Crucifixion affects him differently.  He fully believes

that he is looking upon the very spot where the Savior gave up his

life.  He remembers that Christ was very celebrated, long before he came

to Jerusalem; he knows that his fame was so great that crowds followed

him all the time; he is aware that his entry into the city produced a

stirring sensation, and that his reception was a kind of ovation; he can

not overlook the fact that when he was crucified there were very many in

Jerusalem who believed that he was the true Son of God.  To publicly

execute such a personage was sufficient in itself to make the locality of

the execution a memorable place for ages; added to this, the storm, the

darkness, the earthquake, the rending of the vail of the Temple, and the

untimely waking of the dead, were events calculated to fix the execution

and the scene of it in the memory of even the most thoughtless witness.

Fathers would tell their sons about the strange affair, and point out the

spot; the sons would transmit the story to their children, and thus a

period of three hundred years would easily be spanned--[The thought is

Mr. Prime's, not mine, and is full of good sense.  I borrowed it from his

"Tent Life."--M.  T.]--at which time Helena came and built a church upon

Calvary to commemorate the death and burial of the Lord and preserve the

sacred place in the memories of men; since that time there has always

been a church there.  It is not possible that there can be any mistake

about the locality of the Crucifixion.  Not half a dozen persons knew

where they buried the Saviour, perhaps, and a burial is not a startling

event, any how; therefore, we can be pardoned for unbelief in the

Sepulchre, but not in the place of the Crucifixion.  Five hundred years

hence there will be no vestige of Bunker Hill Monument left, but America

will still know where the battle was fought and where Warren fell.  The

crucifixion of Christ was too notable an event in Jerusalem, and the Hill

of Calvary made too celebrated by it, to be forgotten in the short space

of three hundred years.  I climbed the stairway in the church which

brings one to the top of the small inclosed pinnacle of rock, and looked

upon the place where the true cross once stood, with a far more absorbing

interest than I had ever felt in any thing earthly before.  I could not

believe that the three holes in the top of the rock were the actual ones

the crosses stood in, but I felt satisfied that those crosses had stood

so near the place now occupied by them, that the few feet of possible

difference were a matter of no consequence.



When one stands where the Saviour was crucified, he finds it all he can

do to keep it strictly before his mind that Christ was not crucified in a

Catholic Church.  He must remind himself every now and then that the

great event transpired in the open air, and not in a gloomy, candle-

lighted cell in a little corner of a vast church, up-stairs--a small cell

all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation, in execrable

taste.



Under a marble altar like a table, is a circular hole in the marble

floor, corresponding with the one just under it in which the true Cross

stood.  The first thing every one does is to kneel down and take a candle

and examine this hole.  He does this strange prospecting with an amount

of gravity that can never be estimated or appreciated by a man who has

not seen the operation.  Then he holds his candle before a richly

engraved picture of the Saviour, done on a messy slab of gold, and

wonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds, which hangs above the hole

within the altar, and his solemnity changes to lively admiration.  He

rises and faces the finely wrought figures of the Saviour and the

malefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar, and bright with

a metallic lustre of many colors.  He turns next to the figures close to

them of the Virgin and Mary Magdalen; next to the rift in the living rock

made by the earthquake at the time of the Crucifixion, and an extension

of which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes below; he

looks next at the show-case with a figure of the Virgin in it, and is

amazed at the princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs so

thickly about the form as to hide it like a garment almost.  All about

the apartment the gaudy trappings of the Greek Church offend the eye and

keep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the Place of the

Crucifixion--Golgotha--the Mount of Calvary.  And the last thing he looks

at is that which was also the first--the place where the true Cross

stood.  That will chain him to the spot and compel him to look once more,

and once again, after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost all

interest concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality.



And so I close my chapter on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre--the most

sacred locality on earth to millions and millions of men, and women, and

children, the noble and the humble, bond and free.  In its history from

the first, and in its tremendous associations, it is the most illustrious

edifice in Christendom.  With all its clap-trap side-shows and unseemly

impostures of every kind, it is still grand, reverend, venerable--for a

god died there; for fifteen hundred years its shrines have been wet with

the tears of pilgrims from the earth's remotest confines; for more than

two hundred, the most gallant knights that ever wielded sword wasted

their lives away in a struggle to seize it and hold it sacred from

infidel pollution.  Even in our own day a war, that cost millions of

treasure and rivers of blood, was fought because two rival nations

claimed the sole right to put a new dome upon it.  History is full of

this old Church of the Holy Sepulchre--full of blood that was shed

because of the respect and the veneration in which men held the last

resting-place of the meek and lowly, the mild and gentle, Prince of

Peace!









CHAPTER LIV.



We were standing in a narrow street, by the Tower of Antonio.  "On these

stones that are crumbling away," the guide said, "the Saviour sat and

rested before taking up the cross.  This is the beginning of the

Sorrowful Way, or the Way of Grief."  The party took note of the sacred

spot, and moved on.  We passed under the "Ecce Homo Arch," and saw the

very window from which Pilate's wife warned her husband to have nothing

to do with the persecution of the Just Man.  This window is in an

excellent state of preservation, considering its great age.  They showed

us where Jesus rested the second time, and where the mob refused to give

him up, and said, "Let his blood be upon our heads, and upon our

children's children forever."  The French Catholics are building a church

on this spot, and with their usual veneration for historical relics, are

incorporating into the new such scraps of ancient walls as they have

found there.  Further on, we saw the spot where the fainting Saviour fell

under the weight of his cross.  A great granite column of some ancient

temple lay there at the time, and the heavy cross struck it such a blow

that it broke in two in the middle.  Such was the guide's story when he

halted us before the broken column.



We crossed a street, and came presently to the former residence of St.

Veronica.  When the Saviour passed there, she came out, full of womanly

compassion, and spoke pitying words to him, undaunted by the hootings and

the threatenings of the mob, and wiped the perspiration from his face

with her handkerchief.  We had heard so much of St. Veronica, and seen

her picture by so many masters, that it was like meeting an old friend

unexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in Jerusalem.  The strangest

thing about the incident that has made her name so famous, is, that when

she wiped the perspiration away, the print of the Saviour's face remained

upon the handkerchief, a perfect portrait, and so remains unto this day.

We knew this, because we saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in Paris,

in another in Spain, and in two others in Italy.  In the Milan cathedral

it costs five francs to see it, and at St. Peter's, at Rome, it is almost

impossible to see it at any price.  No tradition is so amply verified as

this of St. Veronica and her handkerchief.



At the next corner we saw a deep indention in the hard stone masonry of

the corner of a house, but might have gone heedlessly by it but that the

guide said it was made by the elbow of the Saviour, who stumbled here and

fell.  Presently we came to just such another indention in a stone wall.

The guide said the Saviour fell here, also, and made this depression with

his elbow.



There were other places where the Lord fell, and others where he rested;

but one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found on this

morning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward Calvary, was a

certain stone built into a house--a stone that was so seamed and scarred

that it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face.  The

projections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the passionate

kisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands.  We asked "Why?"

The guide said it was because this was one of "the very stones of

Jerusalem" that Christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting the

people to cry "Hosannah!"  when he made his memorable entry into the

city upon an ass.  One of the pilgrims said, "But there is no evidence

that the stones did cry out--Christ said that if the people stopped from

shouting Hosannah, the very stones would do it."  The guide was perfectly

serene.  He said, calmly, "This is one of the stones that would have

cried out.  "It was of little use to try to shake this fellow's simple

faith--it was easy to see that.



And so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding interest--

the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has been

celebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years as the

Wandering Jew.  On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he stood in this

old doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the struggling mob

that was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would have sat down and

rested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said, "Move on!"  The

Lord said, "Move on, thou, likewise," and the command has never been

revoked from that day to this.  All men know how that the miscreant upon

whose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down the wide world,

for ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding it--courting death but

always in vain--longing to stop, in city, in wilderness, in desert

solitudes, yet hearing always that relentless warning to march--march on!

They say--do these hoary traditions--that when Titus sacked Jerusalem and

slaughtered eleven hundred thousand Jews in her streets and by-ways, the

Wandering Jew was seen always in the thickest of the fight, and that when

battle-axes gleamed in the air, he bowed his head beneath them; when

swords flashed their deadly lightnings, he sprang in their way; he bared

his breast to whizzing javelins, to hissing arrows, to any and to every

weapon that promised death and forgetfulness, and rest.  But it was

useless--he walked forth out of the carnage without a wound.  And it is

said that five hundred years afterward he followed Mahomet when he

carried destruction to the cities of Arabia, and then turned against him,

hoping in this way to win the death of a traitor.  His calculations were

wrong again.  No quarter was given to any living creature but one, and

that was the only one of all the host that did not want it.  He sought

death five hundred years later, in the wars of the Crusades, and offered

himself to famine and pestilence at Ascalon.  He escaped again--he could

not die.  These repeated annoyances could have at last but one effect--

they shook his confidence.  Since then the Wandering Jew has carried on a

kind of desultory toying with the most promising of the aids and

implements of destruction, but with small hope, as a general thing.  He

has speculated some in cholera and railroads, and has taken almost a

lively interest in infernal machines and patent medicines.  He is old,

now, and grave, as becomes an age like his; he indulges in no light

amusements save that he goes sometimes to executions, and is fond of

funerals.



There is one thing he can not avoid; go where he will about the world, he

must never fail to report in Jerusalem every fiftieth year.  Only a year

or two ago he was here for the thirty-seventh time since Jesus was

crucified on Calvary.  They say that many old people, who are here now,

saw him then, and had seen him before.  He looks always the same--old,

and withered, and hollow-eyed, and listless, save that there is about him

something which seems to suggest that he is looking for some one,

expecting some one--the friends of his youth, perhaps.  But the most of

them are dead, now.  He always pokes about the old streets looking

lonesome, making his mark on a wall here and there, and eyeing the oldest

buildings with a sort of friendly half interest; and he sheds a few tears

at the threshold of his ancient dwelling, and bitter, bitter tears they

are.  Then he collects his rent and leaves again.  He has been seen

standing near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on many a starlight night,

for he has cherished an idea for many centuries that if he could only

enter there, he could rest.  But when he approaches, the doors slam to

with a crash, the earth trembles, and all the lights in Jerusalem burn a

ghastly blue!  He does this every fifty years, just the same.  It is

hopeless, but then it is hard to break habits one has been eighteen

hundred years accustomed to.  The old tourist is far away on his

wanderings, now.  How he must smile to see a pack of blockheads like us,

galloping about the world, and looking wise, and imagining we are finding

out a good deal about it!  He must have a consuming contempt for the

ignorant, complacent asses that go skurrying about the world in these

railroading days and call it traveling.



When the guide pointed out where the Wandering Jew had left his familiar

mark upon a wall, I was filled with astonishment.  It read:



                         "S. T.--1860--X."



All I have revealed about the Wandering Jew can be amply proven by

reference to our guide.



The mighty Mosque of Omar, and the paved court around it, occupy a fourth

part of Jerusalem.  They are upon Mount Moriah, where King Solomon's

Temple stood.  This Mosque is the holiest place the Mohammedan knows,

outside of Mecca.  Up to within a year or two past, no Christian could

gain admission to it or its court for love or money.  But the prohibition

has been removed, and we entered freely for bucksheesh.



I need not speak of the wonderful beauty and the exquisite grace and

symmetry that have made this Mosque so celebrated--because I did not see

them.  One can not see such things at an instant glance--one frequently

only finds out how really beautiful a really beautiful woman is after

considerable acquaintance with her; and the rule applies to Niagara

Falls, to majestic mountains and to mosques--especially to mosques.



The great feature of the Mosque of Omar is the prodigious rock in the

centre of its rotunda.  It was upon this rock that Abraham came so near

offering up his son Isaac--this, at least, is authentic--it is very much

more to be relied on than most of the traditions, at any rate.  On this

rock, also, the angel stood and threatened Jerusalem, and David persuaded

him to spare the city.  Mahomet was well acquainted with this stone.

From it he ascended to heaven.  The stone tried to follow him, and if the

angel Gabriel had not happened by the merest good luck to be there to

seize it, it would have done it.  Very few people have a grip like

Gabriel--the prints of his monstrous fingers, two inches deep, are to be

seen in that rock to-day.



This rock, large as it is, is suspended in the air.  It does not touch

any thing at all.  The guide said so.  This is very wonderful.  In the

place on it where Mahomet stood, he left his foot-prints in the solid

stone.  I should judge that he wore about eighteens.  But what I was

going to say, when I spoke of the rock being suspended, was, that in the

floor of the cavern under it they showed us a slab which they said

covered a hole which was a thing of extraordinary interest to all

Mohammedans, because that hole leads down to perdition, and every soul

that is transferred from thence to Heaven must pass up through this

orifice.  Mahomet stands there and lifts them out by the hair.  All

Mohammedans shave their heads, but they are careful to leave a lock of

hair for the Prophet to take hold of.  Our guide observed that a good

Mohammedan would consider himself doomed to stay with the damned forever

if he were to lose his scalp-lock and die before it grew again.  The most

of them that I have seen ought to stay with the damned, any how, without

reference to how they were barbered.



For several ages no woman has been allowed to enter the cavern where that

important hole is.  The reason is that one of the sex was once caught

there blabbing every thing she knew about what was going on above ground,

to the rapscallions in the infernal regions down below.  She carried her

gossiping to such an extreme that nothing could be kept private--nothing

could be done or said on earth but every body in perdition knew all about

it before the sun went down.  It was about time to suppress this woman's

telegraph, and it was promptly done.  Her breath subsided about the same

time.



The inside of the great mosque is very showy with variegated marble walls

and with windows and inscriptions of elaborate mosaic.  The Turks have

their sacred relics, like the Catholics.  The guide showed us the

veritable armor worn by the great son-in-law and successor of Mahomet,

and also the buckler of Mahomet's uncle.  The great iron railing which

surrounds the rock was ornamented in one place with a thousand rags tied

to its open work.  These are to remind Mahomet not to forget the

worshipers who placed them there.  It is considered the next best thing

to tying threads around his finger by way of reminders.



Just outside the mosque is a miniature temple, which marks the spot where

David and Goliah used to sit and judge the people.--[A pilgrim informs

me that it was not David and Goliah, but David and Saul.  I stick to my

own statement--the guide told me, and he ought to know.]



Every where about the Mosque of Omar are portions of pillars, curiously

wrought altars, and fragments of elegantly carved marble--precious

remains of Solomon's Temple.  These have been dug from all depths in the

soil and rubbish of Mount Moriah, and the Moslems have always shown a

disposition to preserve them with the utmost care.  At that portion of

the ancient wall of Solomon's Temple which is called the Jew's Place of

Wailing, and where the Hebrews assemble every Friday to kiss the

venerated stones and weep over the fallen greatness of Zion, any one can

see a part of the unquestioned and undisputed Temple of Solomon, the same

consisting of three or four stones lying one upon the other, each of

which is about twice as long as a seven-octave piano, and about as thick

as such a piano is high.  But, as I have remarked before, it is only a

year or two ago that the ancient edict prohibiting Christian rubbish like

ourselves to enter the Mosque of Omar and see the costly marbles that

once adorned the inner Temple was annulled.  The designs wrought upon

these fragments are all quaint and peculiar, and so the charm of novelty

is added to the deep interest they naturally inspire.  One meets with

these venerable scraps at every turn, especially in the neighboring

Mosque el Aksa, into whose inner walls a very large number of them are

carefully built for preservation.  These pieces of stone, stained and

dusty with age, dimly hint at a grandeur we have all been taught to

regard as the princeliest ever seen on earth; and they call up pictures

of a pageant that is familiar to all imaginations--camels laden with

spices and treasure--beautiful slaves, presents for Solomon's harem--a

long cavalcade of richly caparisoned beasts and warriors--and Sheba's

Queen in the van of this vision of "Oriental magnificence."  These

elegant fragments bear a richer interest than the solemn vastness of the

stones the Jews kiss in the Place of Wailing can ever have for the

heedless sinner.



Down in the hollow ground, underneath the olives and the orange-trees

that flourish in the court of the great Mosque, is a wilderness of

pillars--remains of the ancient Temple; they supported it.  There are

ponderous archways down there, also, over which the destroying "plough"

of prophecy passed harmless.  It is pleasant to know we are disappointed,

in that we never dreamed we might see portions of the actual Temple of

Solomon, and yet experience no shadow of suspicion that they were a

monkish humbug and a fraud.



We are surfeited with sights.  Nothing has any fascination for us, now,

but the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  We have been there every day, and

have not grown tired of it; but we are weary of every thing else.  The

sights are too many.  They swarm about you at every step; no single foot

of ground in all Jerusalem or within its neighborhood seems to be without

a stirring and important history of its own.  It is a very relief to

steal a walk of a hundred yards without a guide along to talk unceasingly

about every stone you step upon and drag you back ages and ages to the

day when it achieved celebrity.



It seems hardly real when I find myself leaning for a moment on a ruined

wall and looking listlessly down into the historic pool of Bethesda.  I

did not think such things could be so crowded together as to diminish

their interest.  But in serious truth, we have been drifting about, for

several days, using our eyes and our ears more from a sense of duty than

any higher and worthier reason.  And too often we have been glad when it

was time to go home and be distressed no more about illustrious

localities.



Our pilgrims compress too much into one day.  One can gorge sights to

repletion as well as sweetmeats.  Since we breakfasted, this morning, we

have seen enough to have furnished us food for a year's reflection if we

could have seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon them

deliberately.  We visited the pool of Hezekiah, where David saw Uriah's

wife coming from the bath and fell in love with her.



We went out of the city by the Jaffa gate, and of course were told many

things about its Tower of Hippicus.



We rode across the Valley of Hinnom, between two of the Pools of Gihon,

and by an aqueduct built by Solomon, which still conveys water to the

city.  We ascended the Hill of Evil Counsel, where Judas received his

thirty pieces of silver, and we also lingered a moment under the tree a

venerable tradition says he hanged himself on.



We descended to the canon again, and then the guide began to give name

and history to every bank and boulder we came to: "This was the Field of

Blood; these cuttings in the rocks were shrines and temples of Moloch;

here they sacrificed children; yonder is the Zion Gate; the Tyropean

Valley, the Hill of Ophel; here is the junction of the Valley of

Jehoshaphat--on your right is the Well of Job."  We turned up

Jehoshaphat.  The recital went on.  "This is the Mount of Olives; this is

the Hill of Offense; the nest of huts is the Village of Siloam; here,

yonder, every where, is the King's Garden; under this great tree

Zacharias, the high priest, was murdered; yonder is Mount Moriah and the

Temple wall; the tomb of Absalom; the tomb of St. James; the tomb of

Zacharias; beyond, are the Garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of the

Virgin Mary; here is the Pool of Siloam, and----"



We said we would dismount, and quench our thirst, and rest.  We were

burning up with the heat.  We were failing under the accumulated fatigue

of days and days of ceaseless marching.  All were willing.



The Pool is a deep, walled ditch, through which a clear stream of water

runs, that comes from under Jerusalem somewhere, and passing through the

Fountain of the Virgin, or being supplied from it, reaches this place by

way of a tunnel of heavy masonry.  The famous pool looked exactly as it

looked in Solomon's time, no doubt, and the same dusky, Oriental women,

came down in their old Oriental way, and carried off jars of the water on

their heads, just as they did three thousand years ago, and just as they

will do fifty thousand years hence if any of them are still left on

earth.



We went away from there and stopped at the Fountain of the Virgin.  But

the water was not good, and there was no comfort or peace any where, on

account of the regiment of boys and girls and beggars that persecuted us

all the time for bucksheesh.  The guide wanted us to give them some

money, and we did it; but when he went on to say that they were starving

to death we could not but feel that we had done a great sin in throwing

obstacles in the way of such a desirable consummation, and so we tried to

collect it back, but it could not be done.



We entered the Garden of Gethsemane, and we visited the Tomb of the

Virgin, both of which we had seen before.  It is not meet that I should

speak of them now.  A more fitting time will come.



I can not speak now of the Mount of Olives or its view of Jerusalem, the

Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab; nor of the Damascus Gate or the tree

that was planted by King Godfrey of Jerusalem.  One ought to feel

pleasantly when he talks of these things.  I can not say any thing about

the stone column that projects over Jehoshaphat from the Temple wall like

a cannon, except that the Moslems believe Mahomet will sit astride of it

when he comes to judge the world.  It is a pity he could not judge it

from some roost of his own in Mecca, without trespassing on our holy

ground.  Close by is the Golden Gate, in the Temple wall--a gate that was

an elegant piece of sculpture in the time of the Temple, and is even so

yet.  From it, in ancient times, the Jewish High Priest turned loose the

scapegoat and let him flee to the wilderness and bear away his twelve-

month load of the sins of the people.  If they were to turn one loose

now, he would not get as far as the Garden of Gethsemane, till these

miserable vagabonds here would gobble him up,--[Favorite pilgrim

expression.]--sins and all.  They wouldn't care.  Mutton-chops and sin is

good enough living for them.  The Moslems watch the Golden Gate with a

jealous eye, and an anxious one, for they have an honored tradition that

when it falls, Islamism will fall and with it the Ottoman Empire.  It did

not grieve me any to notice that the old gate was getting a little shaky.



We are at home again.  We are exhausted.  The sun has roasted us, almost.

We have full comfort in one reflection, however.  Our experiences in

Europe have taught us that in time this fatigue will be forgotten; the

heat will be forgotten; the thirst, the tiresome volubility of the guide,

the persecutions of the beggars--and then, all that will be left will be

pleasant memories of Jerusalem, memories we shall call up with always

increasing interest as the years go by, memories which some day will

become all beautiful when the last annoyance that incumbers them shall

have faded out of our minds never again to return.  School-boy days are

no happier than the days of after life, but we look back upon them

regretfully because we have forgotten our punishments at school, and how

we grieved when our marbles were lost and our kites destroyed--because we

have forgotten all the sorrows and privations of that canonized epoch and

remember only its orchard robberies, its wooden sword pageants and its

fishing holydays.  We are satisfied.  We can wait.  Our reward will come.

To us, Jerusalem and to-day's experiences will be an enchanted memory a

year hence--memory which money could not buy from us.









CHAPTER LV.



We cast up the account.  It footed up pretty fairly.  There was nothing

more at Jerusalem to be seen, except the traditional houses of Dives and

Lazarus of the parable, the Tombs of the Kings, and those of the Judges;

the spot where they stoned one of the disciples to death, and beheaded

another; the room and the table made celebrated by the Last Supper; the

fig-tree that Jesus withered; a number of historical places about

Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives, and fifteen or twenty others in

different portions of the city itself.



We were approaching the end.  Human nature asserted itself, now.

Overwork and consequent exhaustion began to have their natural effect.

They began to master the energies and dull the ardor of the party.

Perfectly secure now, against failing to accomplish any detail of the

pilgrimage, they felt like drawing in advance upon the holiday soon to be

placed to their credit.  They grew a little lazy.  They were late to

breakfast and sat long at dinner.  Thirty or forty pilgrims had arrived

from the ship, by the short routes, and much swapping of gossip had to be

indulged in.  And in hot afternoons, they showed a strong disposition to

lie on the cool divans in the hotel and smoke and talk about pleasant

experiences of a month or so gone by--for even thus early do episodes of

travel which were sometimes annoying, sometimes exasperating and full as

often of no consequence at all when they transpired, begin to rise above

the dead level of monotonous reminiscences and become shapely landmarks

in one's memory.  The fog-whistle, smothered among a million of trifling

sounds, is not noticed a block away, in the city, but the sailor hears it

far at sea, whither none of those thousands of trifling sounds can reach.

When one is in Rome, all the domes are alike; but when he has gone away

twelve miles, the city fades utterly from sight and leaves St. Peter's

swelling above the level plain like an anchored balloon.  When one is

traveling in Europe, the daily incidents seem all alike; but when he has

placed them all two months and two thousand miles behind him, those that

were worthy of being remembered are prominent, and those that were really

insignificant have vanished.  This disposition to smoke, and idle and

talk, was not well.  It was plain that it must not be allowed to gain

ground.  A diversion must be tried, or demoralization would ensue.  The

Jordan, Jericho and the Dead Sea were suggested.  The remainder of

Jerusalem must be left unvisited, for a little while.  The journey was

approved at once.  New life stirred in every pulse.  In the saddle--

abroad on the plains--sleeping in beds bounded only by the horizon: fancy

was at work with these things in a moment.--It was painful to note how

readily these town-bred men had taken to the free life of the camp and

the desert The nomadic instinct is a human instinct; it was born with

Adam and transmitted through the patriarchs, and after thirty centuries

of steady effort, civilization has not educated it entirely out of us

yet.  It has a charm which, once tasted, a man will yearn to taste again.

The nomadic instinct can not be educated out of an Indian at all.



The Jordan journey being approved, our dragoman was notified.



At nine in the morning the caravan was before the hotel door and we were

at breakfast.  There was a commotion about the place.  Rumors of war and

bloodshed were flying every where.  The lawless Bedouins in the Valley of

the Jordan and the deserts down by the Dead Sea were up in arms, and were

going to destroy all comers.  They had had a battle with a troop of

Turkish cavalry and defeated them; several men killed.  They had shut up

the inhabitants of a village and a Turkish garrison in an old fort near

Jericho, and were besieging them.  They had marched upon a camp of our

excursionists by the Jordan, and the pilgrims only saved their lives by

stealing away and flying to Jerusalem under whip and spur in the darkness

of the night.  Another of our parties had been fired on from an ambush

and then attacked in the open day.  Shots were fired on both sides.

Fortunately there was no bloodshed.  We spoke with the very pilgrim who

had fired one of the shots, and learned from his own lips how, in this

imminent deadly peril, only the cool courage of the pilgrims, their

strength of numbers and imposing display of war material, had saved them

from utter destruction.  It was reported that the Consul had requested

that no more of our pilgrims should go to the Jordan while this state of

things lasted; and further, that he was unwilling that any more should

go, at least without an unusually strong military guard.  Here was

trouble.  But with the horses at the door and every body aware of what

they were there for, what would you have done?  Acknowledged that you

were afraid, and backed shamefully out?  Hardly.  It would not be human

nature, where there were so many women.  You would have done as we did:

said you were not afraid of a million Bedouins--and made your will and

proposed quietly to yourself to take up an unostentatious position in the

rear of the procession.



I think we must all have determined upon the same line of tactics, for it

did seem as if we never would get to Jericho.  I had a notoriously slow

horse, but somehow I could not keep him in the rear, to save my neck.

He was forever turning up in the lead.  In such cases I trembled a

little, and got down to fix my saddle.  But it was not of any use.  The

others all got down to fix their saddles, too.  I never saw such a time

with saddles.  It was the first time any of them had got out of order in

three weeks, and now they had all broken down at once.  I tried walking,

for exercise--I had not had enough in Jerusalem searching for holy

places.  But it was a failure.  The whole mob were suffering for

exercise, and it was not fifteen minutes till they were all on foot and I

had the lead again.  It was very discouraging.



This was all after we got beyond Bethany.  We stopped at the village of

Bethany, an hour out from Jerusalem.  They showed us the tomb of Lazarus.

I had rather live in it than in any house in the town.  And they showed

us also a large "Fountain of Lazarus," and in the centre of the village

the ancient dwelling of Lazarus.  Lazarus appears to have been a man of

property.  The legends of the Sunday Schools do him great injustice; they

give one the impression that he was poor.  It is because they get him

confused with that Lazarus who had no merit but his virtue, and virtue

never has been as respectable as money.  The house of Lazarus is a three-

story edifice, of stone masonry, but the accumulated rubbish of ages has

buried all of it but the upper story.  We took candles and descended to

the dismal cell-like chambers where Jesus sat at meat with Martha and

Mary, and conversed with them about their brother.  We could not but look

upon these old dingy apartments with a more than common interest.



We had had a glimpse, from a mountain top, of the Dead Sea, lying like a

blue shield in the plain of the Jordan, and now we were marching down a

close, flaming, rugged, desolate defile, where no living creature could

enjoy life, except, perhaps, a salamander.  It was such a dreary,

repulsive, horrible solitude!  It was the "wilderness" where John

preached, with camel's hair about his loins--raiment enough--but he never

could have got his locusts and wild honey here.  We were moping along

down through this dreadful place, every man in the rear.  Our guards--two

gorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols and

daggers on board--were loafing ahead.



"Bedouins!"



Every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle.

My first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins.  My second

was to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that

direction.  I acted on the latter impulse.  So did all the others.  If

any Bedouins had approached us, then, from that point of the compass,

they would have paid dearly for their rashness.  We all remarked that,

afterwards.  There would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed there

that no pen could describe.  I know that, because each man told what he

would have done, individually; and such a medley of strange and unheard-

of inventions of cruelty you could not conceive of.  One man said he had

calmly made up his mind to perish where he stood, if need be, but never

yield an inch; he was going to wait, with deadly patience, till he could

count the stripes upon the first Bedouin's jacket, and then count them

and let him have it.  Another was going to sit still till the first lance

reached within an inch of his breast, and then dodge it and seize it.  I

forbear to tell what he was going to do to that Bedouin that owned it.

It makes my blood run cold to think of it.  Another was going to scalp

such Bedouins as fell to his share, and take his bald-headed sons of the

desert home with him alive for trophies.  But the wild-eyed pilgrim

rhapsodist was silent.  His orbs gleamed with a deadly light, but his

lips moved not.  Anxiety grew, and he was questioned.  If he had got a

Bedouin, what would he have done with him--shot him?  He smiled a smile

of grim contempt and shook his head.  Would he have stabbed him?  Another

shake.  Would he have quartered him--flayed him?  More shakes.  Oh!

horror what would he have done?



"Eat him!"



Such was the awful sentence that thundered from his lips.  What was

grammar to a desperado like that?  I was glad in my heart that I had been

spared these scenes of malignant carnage.  No Bedouins attacked our

terrible rear.  And none attacked the front.  The new-comers were only a

reinforcement of cadaverous Arabs, in shirts and bare legs, sent far

ahead of us to brandish rusty guns, and shout and brag, and carry on like

lunatics, and thus scare away all bands of marauding Bedouins that might

lurk about our path.  What a shame it is that armed white Christians must

travel under guard of vermin like this as a protection against the

prowling vagabonds of the desert--those sanguinary outlaws who are always

going to do something desperate, but never do it.  I may as well mention

here that on our whole trip we saw no Bedouins, and had no more use for

an Arab guard than we could have had for patent leather boots and white

kid gloves.  The Bedouins that attacked the other parties of pilgrims so

fiercely were provided for the occasion by the Arab guards of those

parties, and shipped from Jerusalem for temporary service as Bedouins.

They met together in full view of the pilgrims, after the battle, and

took lunch, divided the bucksheesh extorted in the season of danger, and

then accompanied the cavalcade home to the city!  The nuisance of an Arab

guard is one which is created by the Sheiks and the Bedouins together,

for mutual profit, it is said, and no doubt there is a good deal of truth

in it.



We visited the fountain the prophet Elisha sweetened (it is sweet yet,)

where he remained some time and was fed by the ravens.



Ancient Jericho is not very picturesque as a ruin.  When Joshua marched

around it seven times, some three thousand years ago, and blew it down

with his trumpet, he did the work so well and so completely that he

hardly left enough of the city to cast a shadow.  The curse pronounced

against the rebuilding of it, has never been removed.  One King, holding

the curse in light estimation, made the attempt, but was stricken sorely

for his presumption.  Its site will always remain unoccupied; and yet it

is one of the very best locations for a town we have seen in all

Palestine.



At two in the morning they routed us out of bed--another piece of

unwarranted cruelty--another stupid effort of our dragoman to get ahead

of a rival.  It was not two hours to the Jordan.  However, we were

dressed and under way before any one thought of looking to see what time

it was, and so we drowsed on through the chill night air and dreamed of

camp fires, warm beds, and other comfortable things.



There was no conversation.  People do not talk when they are cold, and

wretched, and sleepy.  We nodded in the saddle, at times, and woke up

with a start to find that the procession had disappeared in the gloom.

Then there was energy and attention to business until its dusky outlines

came in sight again.  Occasionally the order was passed in a low voice

down the line: "Close up--close up!  Bedouins lurk here, every where!"

What an exquisite shudder it sent shivering along one's spine!



We reached the famous river before four o'clock, and the night was so

black that we could have ridden into it without seeing it.  Some of us

were in an unhappy frame of mind.  We waited and waited for daylight, but

it did not come.  Finally we went away in the dark and slept an hour on

the ground, in the bushes, and caught cold.  It was a costly nap, on that

account, but otherwise it was a paying investment because it brought

unconsciousness of the dreary minutes and put us in a somewhat fitter

mood for a first glimpse of the sacred river.



With the first suspicion of dawn, every pilgrim took off his clothes and

waded into the dark torrent, singing:



               "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,

               And cast a wistful eye

               To Canaan's fair and happy land,

               Where my possessions lie."



But they did not sing long.  The water was so fearfully cold that they

were obliged to stop singing and scamper out again.  Then they stood on

the bank shivering, and so chagrined and so grieved, that they merited

holiest compassion.  Because another dream, another cherished hope, had

failed.  They had promised themselves all along that they would cross the

Jordan where the Israelites crossed it when they entered Canaan from

their long pilgrimage in the desert.  They would cross where the twelve

stones were placed in memory of that great event.  While they did it they

would picture to themselves that vast army of pilgrims marching through

the cloven waters, bearing the hallowed ark of the covenant and shouting

hosannahs, and singing songs of thanksgiving and praise.  Each had

promised himself that he would be the first to cross.  They were at the

goal of their hopes at last, but the current was too swift, the water was

too cold!



It was then that Jack did them a service.  With that engaging

recklessness of consequences which is natural to youth, and so proper and

so seemly, as well, he went and led the way across the Jordan, and all

was happiness again.  Every individual waded over, then, and stood upon

the further bank.  The water was not quite breast deep, any where.  If it

had been more, we could hardly have accomplished the feat, for the strong

current would have swept us down the stream, and we would have been

exhausted and drowned before reaching a place where we could make a

landing.  The main object compassed, the drooping, miserable party sat

down to wait for the sun again, for all wanted to see the water as well

as feel it.  But it was too cold a pastime.  Some cans were filled from

the holy river, some canes cut from its banks, and then we mounted and

rode reluctantly away to keep from freezing to death.  So we saw the

Jordan very dimly.  The thickets of bushes that bordered its banks threw

their shadows across its shallow, turbulent waters ("stormy," the hymn

makes them, which is rather a complimentary stretch of fancy,) and we

could not judge of the width of the stream by the eye.  We knew by our

wading experience, however, that many streets in America are double as

wide as the Jordan.



Daylight came, soon after we got under way, and in the course of an hour

or two we reached the Dead Sea.  Nothing grows in the flat, burning

desert around it but weeds and the Dead Sea apple the poets say is

beautiful to the eye, but crumbles to ashes and dust when you break it.

Such as we found were not handsome, but they were bitter to the taste.

They yielded no dust.  It was because they were not ripe, perhaps.



The desert and the barren hills gleam painfully in the sun, around the

Dead Sea, and there is no pleasant thing or living creature upon it or

about its borders to cheer the eye.  It is a scorching, arid, repulsive

solitude.  A silence broods over the scene that is depressing to the

spirits.  It makes one think of funerals and death.



The Dead Sea is small.  Its waters are very clear, and it has a pebbly

bottom and is shallow for some distance out from the shores.  It yields

quantities of asphaltum; fragments of it lie all about its banks; this

stuff gives the place something of an unpleasant smell.



All our reading had taught us to expect that the first plunge into the

Dead Sea would be attended with distressing results--our bodies would

feel as if they were suddenly pierced by millions of red-hot needles; the

dreadful smarting would continue for hours; we might even look to be

blistered from head to foot, and suffer miserably for many days.  We were

disappointed.  Our eight sprang in at the same time that another party of

pilgrims did, and nobody screamed once.  None of them ever did complain

of any thing more than a slight pricking sensation in places where their

skin was abraded, and then only for a short time.  My face smarted for a

couple of hours, but it was partly because I got it badly sun-burned

while I was bathing, and staid in so long that it became plastered over

with salt.



No, the water did not blister us; it did not cover us with a slimy ooze

and confer upon us an atrocious fragrance; it was not very slimy; and I

could not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have always

smelt since we have been in Palestine.  It was only a different kind of

smell, but not conspicuous on that account, because we have a great deal

of variety in that respect.  We didn't smell, there on the Jordan, the

same as we do in Jerusalem; and we don't smell in Jerusalem just as we

did in Nazareth, or Tiberias, or Cesarea Philippi, or any of those other

ruinous ancient towns in Galilee.  No, we change all the time, and

generally for the worse.  We do our own washing.



It was a funny bath.  We could not sink.  One could stretch himself at

full length on his back, with his arms on his breast, and all of his body

above a line drawn from the corner of his jaw past the middle of his

side, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain out

of water.  He could lift his head clear out, if he chose.  No position

can be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first on your

back and then on your face, and so on.  You can lie comfortably, on your

back, with your head out, and your legs out from your knees down, by

steadying yourself with your hands.  You can sit, with your knees drawn

up to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound to

turn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position.  You can

stand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle of

your breast upward you will not be wet.  But you can not remain so.  The

water will soon float your feet to the surface.  You can not swim on your

back and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stick

away above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with but

your heels.  If you swim on your face, you kick up the water like a

stern-wheel boat.  You make no headway.  A horse is so top-heavy that he

can neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea.  He turns over on his side

at once.  Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came out

coated with salt till we shone like icicles.  We scrubbed it off with a

coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it was

one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for

several weeks enjoying.  It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it

that charmed us.  Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of

the lake.  In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.



When I was a boy I somehow got the impression that the river Jordan was

four thousand miles long and thirty-five miles wide.  It is only ninety

miles long, and so crooked that a man does not know which side of it he

is on half the time.  In going ninety miles it does not get over more

than fifty miles of ground.  It is not any wider than Broadway in New

York.



There is the Sea of Galilee and this Dead Sea--neither of them twenty

miles long or thirteen wide.  And yet when I was in Sunday School I

thought they were sixty thousand miles in diameter.



Travel and experience mar the grandest pictures and rob us of the most

cherished traditions of our boyhood.  Well, let them go.  I have already

seen the Empire of King Solomon diminish to the size of the State of

Pennsylvania; I suppose I can bear the reduction of the seas and the

river.



We looked every where, as we passed along, but never saw grain or crystal

of Lot's wife.  It was a great disappointment.  For many and many a year

we had known her sad story, and taken that interest in her which

misfortune always inspires.  But she was gone.  Her picturesque form no

longer looms above the desert of the Dead Sea to remind the tourist of

the doom that fell upon the lost cities.



I can not describe the hideous afternoon's ride from the Dead Sea to Mars

Saba.  It oppresses me yet, to think of it.  The sun so pelted us that

the tears ran down our cheeks once or twice.  The ghastly, treeless,

grassless, breathless canons smothered us as if we had been in an oven.

The sun had positive weight to it, I think.  Not a man could sit erect

under it.  All drooped low in the saddles.  John preached in this

"Wilderness!"  It must have been exhausting work.  What a very heaven the

messy towers and ramparts of vast Mars Saba looked to us when we caught a

first glimpse of them!



We staid at this great convent all night, guests of the hospitable

priests.  Mars Saba, perched upon a crag, a human nest stock high up

against a perpendicular mountain wall, is a world of grand masonry that

rises, terrace upon terrace away above your head, like the terraced and

retreating colonnades one sees in fanciful pictures of Belshazzar's Feast

and the palaces of the ancient Pharaohs.  No other human dwelling is

near.  It was founded many ages ago by a holy recluse who lived at first

in a cave in the rock--a cave which is inclosed in the convent walls,

now, and was reverently shown to us by the priests.  This recluse, by his

rigorous torturing of his flesh, his diet of bread and water, his utter

withdrawal from all society and from the vanities of the world, and his

constant prayer and saintly contemplation of a skull, inspired an

emulation that brought about him many disciples.  The precipice on the

opposite side of the canyon is well perforated with the small holes they

dug in the rock to live in.  The present occupants of Mars Saba, about

seventy in number, are all hermits.  They wear a coarse robe, an ugly,

brimless stove-pipe of a hat, and go without shoes.  They eat nothing

whatever but bread and salt; they drink nothing but water.  As long as

they live they can never go outside the walls, or look upon a woman--for

no woman is permitted to enter Mars Saba, upon any pretext whatsoever.



Some of those men have been shut up there for thirty years.  In all that

dreary time they have not heard the laughter of a child or the blessed

voice of a woman; they have seen no human tears, no human smiles; they

have known no human joys, no wholesome human sorrows.  In their hearts

are no memories of the past, in their brains no dreams of the future.

All that is lovable, beautiful, worthy, they have put far away from them;

against all things that are pleasant to look upon, and all sounds that

are music to the ear, they have barred their massive doors and reared

their relentless walls of stone forever.  They have banished the tender

grace of life and left only the sapped and skinny mockery.  Their lips

are lips that never kiss and never sing; their hearts are hearts that

never hate and never love; their breasts are breasts that never swell

with the sentiment, "I have a country and a flag."  They are dead men who

walk.



I set down these first thoughts because they are natural--not because

they are just or because it is right to set them down.  It is easy for

book-makers to say "I thought so and so as I looked upon such and such a

scene"--when the truth is, they thought all those fine things afterwards.

One's first thought is not likely to be strictly accurate, yet it is no

crime to think it and none to write it down, subject to modification by

later experience.  These hermits are dead men, in several respects, but

not in all; and it is not proper, that, thinking ill of them at first, I

should go on doing so, or, speaking ill of them I should reiterate the

words and stick to them.  No, they treated us too kindly for that.  There

is something human about them somewhere.  They knew we were foreigners

and Protestants, and not likely to feel admiration or much friendliness

toward them.  But their large charity was above considering such things.

They simply saw in us men who were hungry, and thirsty, and tired, and

that was sufficient.  They opened their doors and gave us welcome.  They

asked no questions, and they made no self-righteous display of their

hospitality.  They fished for no compliments.  They moved quietly about,

setting the table for us, making the beds, and bringing water to wash in,

and paid no heed when we said it was wrong for them to do that when we

had men whose business it was to perform such offices.  We fared most

comfortably, and sat late at dinner.  We walked all over the building

with the hermits afterward, and then sat on the lofty battlements and

smoked while we enjoyed the cool air, the wild scenery and the sunset.

One or two chose cosy bed-rooms to sleep in, but the nomadic instinct

prompted the rest to sleep on the broad divan that extended around the

great hall, because it seemed like sleeping out of doors, and so was more

cheery and inviting.  It was a royal rest we had.



When we got up to breakfast in the morning, we were new men.  For all

this hospitality no strict charge was made.  We could give something if

we chose; we need give nothing, if we were poor or if we were stingy.

The pauper and the miser are as free as any in the Catholic Convents of

Palestine.  I have been educated to enmity toward every thing that is

Catholic, and sometimes, in consequence of this, I find it much easier to

discover Catholic faults than Catholic merits.  But there is one thing I

feel no disposition to overlook, and no disposition to forget: and that

is, the honest gratitude I and all pilgrims owe, to the Convent Fathers

in Palestine.  Their doors are always open, and there is always a welcome

for any worthy man who comes, whether he comes in rags or clad in purple.

The Catholic Convents are a priceless blessing to the poor.  A pilgrim

without money, whether he be a Protestant or a Catholic, can travel the

length and breadth of Palestine, and in the midst of her desert wastes

find wholesome food and a clean bed every night, in these buildings.

Pilgrims in better circumstances are often stricken down by the sun and

the fevers of the country, and then their saving refuge is the Convent.

Without these hospitable retreats, travel in Palestine would be a

pleasure which none but the strongest men could dare to undertake.  Our

party, pilgrims and all, will always be ready and always willing, to

touch glasses and drink health, prosperity and long life to the Convent

Fathers of Palestine.



So, rested and refreshed, we fell into line and filed away over the

barren mountains of Judea, and along rocky ridges and through sterile

gorges, where eternal silence and solitude reigned.  Even the scattering

groups of armed shepherds we met the afternoon before, tending their

flocks of long-haired goats, were wanting here.  We saw but two living

creatures.  They were gazelles, of "soft-eyed" notoriety.  They looked

like very young kids, but they annihilated distance like an express

train.  I have not seen animals that moved faster, unless I might say it

of the antelopes of our own great plains.



At nine or ten in the morning we reached the Plain of the Shepherds, and

stood in a walled garden of olives where the shepherds were watching

their flocks by night, eighteen centuries ago, when the multitude of

angels brought them the tidings that the Saviour was born.  A quarter of

a mile away was Bethlehem of Judea, and the pilgrims took some of the

stone wall and hurried on.



The Plain of the Shepherds is a desert, paved with loose stones, void of

vegetation, glaring in the fierce sun.  Only the music of the angels it

knew once could charm its shrubs and flowers to life again and restore

its vanished beauty.  No less potent enchantment could avail to work this

miracle.



In the huge Church of the Nativity, in Bethlehem, built fifteen hundred

years ago by the inveterate St. Helena, they took us below ground, and

into a grotto cut in the living rock.  This was the "manger" where Christ

was born.  A silver star set in the floor bears a Latin inscription to

that effect.  It is polished with the kisses of many generations of

worshiping pilgrims.  The grotto was tricked out in the usual tasteless

style observable in all the holy places of Palestine.  As in the Church

of the Holy Sepulchre, envy and uncharitableness were apparent here.  The

priests and the members of the Greek and Latin churches can not come by

the same corridor to kneel in the sacred birthplace of the Redeemer, but

are compelled to approach and retire by different avenues, lest they

quarrel and fight on this holiest ground on earth.



I have no "meditations," suggested by this spot where the very first

"Merry Christmas!" was uttered in all the world, and from whence the

friend of my childhood, Santa Claus, departed on his first journey, to

gladden and continue to gladden roaring firesides on wintry mornings in

many a distant land forever and forever.  I touch, with reverent finger,

the actual spot where the infant Jesus lay, but I think--nothing.



You can not think in this place any more than you can in any other in

Palestine that would be likely to inspire reflection.  Beggars, cripples

and monks compass you about, and make you think only of bucksheesh when

you would rather think of something more in keeping with the character of

the spot.



I was glad to get away, and glad when we had walked through the grottoes

where Eusebius wrote, and Jerome fasted, and Joseph prepared for the

flight into Egypt, and the dozen other distinguished grottoes, and knew

we were done.  The Church of the Nativity is almost as well packed with

exceeding holy places as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself.  They

even have in it a grotto wherein twenty thousand children were

slaughtered by Herod when he was seeking the life of the infant Saviour.



We went to the Milk Grotto, of course--a cavern where Mary hid herself

for a while before the flight into Egypt.  Its walls were black before

she entered, but in suckling the Child, a drop of her milk fell upon the

floor and instantly changed the darkness of the walls to its own snowy

hue.  We took many little fragments of stone from here, because it is

well known in all the East that a barren woman hath need only to touch

her lips to one of these and her failing will depart from her.  We took

many specimens, to the end that we might confer happiness upon certain

households that we wot of.



We got away from Bethlehem and its troops of beggars and relic-peddlers

in the afternoon, and after spending some little time at Rachel's tomb,

hurried to Jerusalem as fast as possible.  I never was so glad to get

home again before.  I never have enjoyed rest as I have enjoyed it during

these last few hours.  The journey to the Dead Sea, the Jordan and

Bethlehem was short, but it was an exhausting one.  Such roasting heat,

such oppressive solitude, and such dismal desolation can not surely exist

elsewhere on earth.  And such fatigue!



The commonest sagacity warns me that I ought to tell the customary

pleasant lie, and say I tore myself reluctantly away from every noted

place in Palestine.  Every body tells that, but with as little

ostentation as I may, I doubt the word of every he who tells it.  I could

take a dreadful oath that I have never heard any one of our forty

pilgrims say any thing of the sort, and they are as worthy and as

sincerely devout as any that come here.  They will say it when they get

home, fast enough, but why should they not?  They do not wish to array

themselves against all the Lamartines and Grimeses in the world.  It does

not stand to reason that men are reluctant to leave places where the very

life is almost badgered out of them by importunate swarms of beggars and

peddlers who hang in strings to one's sleeves and coat-tails and shriek

and shout in his ears and horrify his vision with the ghastly sores and

malformations they exhibit.  One is glad to get away.  I have heard

shameless people say they were glad to get away from Ladies' Festivals

where they were importuned to buy by bevies of lovely young ladies.

Transform those houris into dusky hags and ragged savages, and replace

their rounded forms with shrunken and knotted distortions, their soft

hands with scarred and hideous deformities, and the persuasive music of

their voices with the discordant din of a hated language, and then see

how much lingering reluctance to leave could be mustered.  No, it is the

neat thing to say you were reluctant, and then append the profound

thoughts that "struggled for utterance," in your brain; but it is the

true thing to say you were not reluctant, and found it impossible to

think at all--though in good sooth it is not respectable to say it, and

not poetical, either.



We do not think, in the holy places; we think in bed, afterwards, when

the glare, and the noise, and the confusion are gone, and in fancy we

revisit alone, the solemn monuments of the past, and summon the phantom

pageants of an age that has passed away.









CHAPTER LVI.



We visited all the holy places about Jerusalem which we had left

unvisited when we journeyed to the Jordan and then, about three o'clock

one afternoon, we fell into procession and marched out at the stately

Damascus gate, and the walls of Jerusalem shut us out forever.  We paused

on the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a final

farewell to the venerable city which had been such a good home to us.



For about four hours we traveled down hill constantly.  We followed a

narrow bridle-path which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges, and

when we could we got out of the way of the long trains of laden camels

and asses, and when we could not we suffered the misery of being mashed

up against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by the

passing freight.  Jack was caught two or three times, and Dan and Moult

as often.  One horse had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks, and the

others had narrow escapes.  However, this was as good a road as we had

found in Palestine, and possibly even the best, and so there was not much

grumbling.



Sometimes, in the glens, we came upon luxuriant orchards of figs,

apricots, pomegranates, and such things, but oftener the scenery was

rugged, mountainous, verdureless and forbidding.  Here and there, towers

were perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost inaccessible.

This fashion is as old as Palestine itself and was adopted in ancient

times for security against enemies.



We crossed the brook which furnished David the stone that killed Goliah,

and no doubt we looked upon the very ground whereon that noted battle was

fought.  We passed by a picturesque old gothic ruin whose stone pavements

had rung to the armed heels of many a valorous Crusader, and we rode

through a piece of country which we were told once knew Samson as a

citizen.



We staid all night with the good monks at the convent of Ramleh, and in

the morning got up and galloped the horses a good part of the distance

from there to Jaffa, or Joppa, for the plain was as level as a floor and

free from stones, and besides this was our last march in Holy Land.

These two or three hours finished, we and the tired horses could have

rest and sleep as long as we wanted it.  This was the plain of which

Joshua spoke when he said, "Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon, and thou

moon in the valley of Ajalon."  As we drew near to Jaffa, the boys

spurred up the horses and indulged in the excitement of an actual race--

an experience we had hardly had since we raced on donkeys in the Azores

islands.



We came finally to the noble grove of orange-trees in which the Oriental

city of Jaffa lies buried; we passed through the walls, and rode again

down narrow streets and among swarms of animated rags, and saw other

sights and had other experiences we had long been familiar with.  We

dismounted, for the last time, and out in the offing, riding at anchor,

we saw the ship!  I put an exclamation point there because we felt one

when we saw the vessel.  The long pilgrimage was ended, and somehow we

seemed to feel glad of it.



[For description of Jaffa, see Universal Gazetteer.] Simon the Tanner

formerly lived here.  We went to his house.  All the pilgrims visit Simon

the Tanner's house.  Peter saw the vision of the beasts let down in a

sheet when he lay upon the roof of Simon the Tanner's house.  It was from

Jaffa that Jonah sailed when he was told to go and prophesy against

Nineveh, and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threw

him up when he discovered that he had no ticket.  Jonah was disobedient,

and of a fault-finding, complaining disposition, and deserves to be

lightly spoken of, almost.  The timbers used in the construction of

Solomon's Temple were floated to Jaffa in rafts, and the narrow opening

in the reef through which they passed to the shore is not an inch wider

or a shade less dangerous to navigate than it was then.  Such is the

sleepy nature of the population Palestine's only good seaport has now and

always had.  Jaffa has a history and a stirring one.  It will not be

discovered any where in this book.  If the reader will call at the

circulating library and mention my name, he will be furnished with books

which will afford him the fullest information concerning Jaffa.



So ends the pilgrimage.  We ought to be glad that we did not make it for

the purpose of feasting our eyes upon fascinating aspects of nature, for

we should have been disappointed--at least at this season of the year.  A

writer in "Life in the Holy Land" observes:



     "Monotonous and uninviting as much of the Holy Land will appear to

     persons accustomed to the almost constant verdure of flowers, ample

     streams and varied surface of our own country, we must remember that

     its aspect to the Israelites after the weary march of forty years

     through the desert must have been very different."



Which all of us will freely grant.  But it truly is "monotonous and

uninviting," and there is no sufficient reason for describing it as being

otherwise.



Of all the lands there are for dismal scenery, I think Palestine must be

the prince.  The hills are barren, they are dull of color, they are

unpicturesque in shape.  The valleys are unsightly deserts fringed with a

feeble vegetation that has an expression about it of being sorrowful and

despondent.  The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee sleep in the midst of a

vast stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasant

tint, no striking object, no soft picture dreaming in a purple haze or

mottled with the shadows of the clouds.  Every outline is harsh, every

feature is distinct, there is no perspective--distance works no

enchantment here.  It is a hopeless, dreary, heart-broken land.



Small shreds and patches of it must be very beautiful in the full flush

of spring, however, and all the more beautiful by contrast with the far-

reaching desolation that surrounds them on every side.  I would like much

to see the fringes of the Jordan in spring-time, and Shechem, Esdraelon,

Ajalon and the borders of Galilee--but even then these spots would seem

mere toy gardens set at wide intervals in the waste of a limitless

desolation.



Palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes.  Over it broods the spell of a

curse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies.  Where

Sodom and Gomorrah reared their domes and towers, that solemn sea now

floods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing exists--over

whose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and dead--

about whose borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts of

cane, and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to parching

lips, but turns to ashes at the touch.  Nazareth is forlorn; about that

ford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised Land with

songs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic Bedouins

of the desert; Jericho the accursed, lies a moldering ruin, to-day, even

as Joshua's miracle left it more than three thousand years ago; Bethlehem

and Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have nothing about

them now to remind one that they once knew the high honor of the

Saviour's presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched their

flocks by night, and where the angels sang Peace on earth, good will to

men, is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any feature

that is pleasant to the eye.  Renowned Jerusalem itself, the stateliest

name in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is become a

pauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to compel the

admiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple which was

the pride and the glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman crescent is

lifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day in the annals of

the world, they reared the Holy Cross.  The noted Sea of Galilee, where

Roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the Saviour sailed

in their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of war and

commerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is a

shapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida and

Chorazin have vanished from the earth, and the "desert places" round

about them where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour's voice

and ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that is

inhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.



Palestine is desolate and unlovely.  And why should it be otherwise?  Can

the curse of the Deity beautify a land?



Palestine is no more of this work-day world.  It is sacred to poetry and

tradition--it is dream-land.









CHAPTER LVII.



It was worth a kingdom to be at sea again.  It was a relief to drop all

anxiety whatsoever--all questions as to where we should go; how long we

should stay; whether it were worth while to go or not; all anxieties

about the condition of the horses; all such questions as "Shall we ever

get to water?"  "Shall we ever lunch?"  "Ferguson, how many more million

miles have we got to creep under this awful sun before we camp?"  It was

a relief to cast all these torturing little anxieties far away--ropes of

steel they were, and every one with a separate and distinct strain on it

--and feel the temporary contentment that is born of the banishment of

all care and responsibility.  We did not look at the compass: we did not

care, now, where the ship went to, so that she went out of sight of land

as quickly as possible.  When I travel again, I wish to go in a pleasure

ship.  No amount of money could have purchased for us, in a strange

vessel and among unfamiliar faces, the perfect satisfaction and the sense

of being at home again which we experienced when we stepped on board the

"Quaker City,"--our own ship--after this wearisome pilgrimage.  It is a

something we have felt always when we returned to her, and a something we

had no desire to sell.



We took off our blue woollen shirts, our spurs, and heavy boots, our

sanguinary revolvers and our buckskin-seated pantaloons, and got shaved

and came out in Christian costume once more.  All but Jack, who changed

all other articles of his dress, but clung to his traveling pantaloons.

They still preserved their ample buckskin seat intact; and so his short

pea jacket and his long, thin legs assisted to make him a picturesque

object whenever he stood on the forecastle looking abroad upon the ocean

over the bows.  At such times his father's last injunction suggested

itself to me.  He said:



"Jack, my boy, you are about to go among a brilliant company of gentlemen

and ladies, who are refined and cultivated, and thoroughly accomplished

in the manners and customs of good society.  Listen to their

conversation, study their habits of life, and learn.  Be polite and

obliging to all, and considerate towards every one's opinions, failings

and prejudices.  Command the just respect of all your fellow-voyagers,

even though you fail to win their friendly regard.  And Jack--don't you

ever dare, while you live, appear in public on those decks in fair

weather, in a costume unbecoming your mother's drawing-room!"



It would have been worth any price if the father of this hopeful youth

could have stepped on board some time, and seen him standing high on the

fore-castle, pea jacket, tasseled red fez, buckskin patch and all,

placidly contemplating the ocean--a rare spectacle for any body's

drawing-room.



After a pleasant voyage and a good rest, we drew near to Egypt and out of

the mellowest of sunsets we saw the domes and minarets of Alexandria rise

into view.  As soon as the anchor was down, Jack and I got a boat and

went ashore.  It was night by this time, and the other passengers were

content to remain at home and visit ancient Egypt after breakfast.  It

was the way they did at Constantinople.  They took a lively interest in

new countries, but their school-boy impatience had worn off, and they had

learned that it was wisdom to take things easy and go along comfortably--

these old countries do not go away in the night; they stay till after

breakfast.



When we reached the pier we found an army of Egyptian boys with donkeys

no larger than themselves, waiting for passengers--for donkeys are the

omnibuses of Egypt.  We preferred to walk, but we could not have our own

way.  The boys crowded about us, clamored around us, and slewed their

donkeys exactly across our path, no matter which way we turned.  They

were good-natured rascals, and so were the donkeys.  We mounted, and the

boys ran behind us and kept the donkeys in a furious gallop, as is the

fashion at Damascus.  I believe I would rather ride a donkey than any

beast in the world.  He goes briskly, he puts on no airs, he is docile,

though opinionated.  Satan himself could not scare him, and he is

convenient--very convenient.  When you are tired riding you can rest your

feet on the ground and let him gallop from under you.



We found the hotel and secured rooms, and were happy to know that the

Prince of Wales had stopped there once.  They had it every where on

signs.  No other princes had stopped there since, till Jack and I came.

We went abroad through the town, then, and found it a city of huge

commercial buildings, and broad, handsome streets brilliant with gas-

light.  By night it was a sort of reminiscence of Paris.  But finally

Jack found an ice-cream saloon, and that closed investigations for that

evening.  The weather was very hot, it had been many a day since Jack had

seen ice-cream, and so it was useless to talk of leaving the saloon till

it shut up.



In the morning the lost tribes of America came ashore and infested the

hotels and took possession of all the donkeys and other open barouches

that offered.  They went in picturesque procession to the American

Consul's; to the great gardens; to Cleopatra's Needles; to Pompey's

Pillar; to the palace of the Viceroy of Egypt; to the Nile; to the superb

groves of date-palms.  One of our most inveterate relic-hunters had his

hammer with him, and tried to break a fragment off the upright Needle and

could not do it; he tried the prostrate one and failed; he borrowed a

heavy sledge hammer from a mason and tried again.  He tried Pompey's

Pillar, and this baffled him.  Scattered all about the mighty monolith

were sphinxes of noble countenance, carved out of Egyptian granite as

hard as blue steel, and whose shapely features the wear of five thousand

years had failed to mark or mar.  The relic-hunter battered at these

persistently, and sweated profusely over his work.  He might as well have

attempted to deface the moon.  They regarded him serenely with the

stately smile they had worn so long, and which seemed to say, "Peck away,

poor insect; we were not made to fear such as you; in ten-score dragging

ages we have seen more of your kind than there are sands at your feet:

have they left a blemish upon us?"



But I am forgetting the Jaffa Colonists.  At Jaffa we had taken on board

some forty members of a very celebrated community.  They were male and

female; babies, young boys and young girls; young married people, and

some who had passed a shade beyond the prime of life.  I refer to the

"Adams Jaffa Colony."  Others had deserted before.  We left in Jaffa Mr.

Adams, his wife, and fifteen unfortunates who not only had no money but

did not know where to turn or whither to go.  Such was the statement made

to us.  Our forty were miserable enough in the first place, and they lay

about the decks seasick all the voyage, which about completed their

misery, I take it.  However, one or two young men remained upright, and

by constant persecution we wormed out of them some little information.

They gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary condition, for, having

been shamefully humbugged by their prophet, they felt humiliated and

unhappy.  In such circumstances people do not like to talk.



The colony was a complete fiasco.  I have already said that such as could

get away did so, from time to time.  The prophet Adams--once an actor,

then several other things, afterward a Mormon and a missionary, always an

adventurer--remains at Jaffa with his handful of sorrowful subjects.  The

forty we brought away with us were chiefly destitute, though not all of

them.  They wished to get to Egypt.  What might become of them then they

did not know and probably did not care--any thing to get away from hated

Jaffa.  They had little to hope for.  Because after many appeals to the

sympathies of New England, made by strangers of Boston, through the

newspapers, and after the establishment of an office there for the

reception of moneyed contributions for the Jaffa colonists, One Dollar

was subscribed.  The consul-general for Egypt showed me the newspaper

paragraph which mentioned the circumstance and mentioned also the

discontinuance of the effort and the closing of the office.  It was

evident that practical New England was not sorry to be rid of such

visionaries and was not in the least inclined to hire any body to bring

them back to her.  Still, to get to Egypt, was something, in the eyes of

the unfortunate colonists, hopeless as the prospect seemed of ever

getting further.



Thus circumstanced, they landed at Alexandria from our ship.  One of our

passengers, Mr. Moses S. Beach, of the New York Sun, inquired of the

consul-general what it would cost to send these people to their home in

Maine by the way of Liverpool, and he said fifteen hundred dollars in

gold would do it.  Mr. Beach gave his check for the money and so the

troubles of the Jaffa colonists were at an end.--[It was an unselfish

act of benevolence; it was done without any ostentation, and has never

been mentioned in any newspaper, I think.  Therefore it is refreshing to

learn now, several months after the above narrative was written, that

another man received all the credit of this rescue of the colonists.

Such is life.]



Alexandria was too much like a European city to be novel, and we soon

tired of it.  We took the cars and came up here to ancient Cairo, which

is an Oriental city and of the completest pattern.  There is little about

it to disabuse one's mind of the error if he should take it into his head

that he was in the heart of Arabia.  Stately camels and dromedaries,

swarthy Egyptians, and likewise Turks and black Ethiopians, turbaned,

sashed, and blazing in a rich variety of Oriental costumes of all shades

of flashy colors, are what one sees on every hand crowding the narrow

streets and the honeycombed bazaars.  We are stopping at Shepherd's

Hotel, which is the worst on earth except the one I stopped at once in a

small town in the United States.  It is pleasant to read this sketch in

my note-book, now, and know that I can stand Shepherd's Hotel, sure,

because I have been in one just like it in America and survived:



     I stopped at the Benton House.  It used to be a good hotel, but that

     proves nothing--I used to be a good boy, for that matter.  Both of

     us have lost character of late years.  The Benton is not a good

     hotel.  The Benton lacks a very great deal of being a good hotel.

     Perdition is full of better hotels than the Benton.



     It was late at night when I got there, and I told the clerk I would

     like plenty of lights, because I wanted to read an hour or two.

     When I reached No. 15 with the porter (we came along a dim hall that

     was clad in ancient carpeting, faded, worn out in many places, and

     patched with old scraps of oil cloth--a hall that sank under one's

     feet, and creaked dismally to every footstep,) he struck a light--

     two inches of sallow, sorrowful, consumptive tallow candle, that

     burned blue, and sputtered, and got discouraged and went out.  The

     porter lit it again, and I asked if that was all the light the clerk

     sent.  He said, "Oh no, I've got another one here," and he produced

     another couple of inches of tallow candle.  I said, "Light them both

     --I'll have to have one to see the other by."  He did it, but the

     result was drearier than darkness itself.  He was a cheery,

     accommodating rascal.  He said he would go "somewheres" and steal a

     lamp.  I abetted and encouraged him in his criminal design.  I heard

     the landlord get after him in the hall ten minutes afterward.



     "Where are you going with that lamp?"



     "Fifteen wants it, sir."



     "Fifteen!  why he's got a double lot of candles--does the man want

     to illuminate the house?--does he want to get up a torch-light

     procession?--what is he up to, any how?"



     "He don't like them candles--says he wants a lamp."



     "Why what in the nation does----why I never heard of such a thing?

     What on earth can he want with that lamp?"



     "Well, he only wants to read--that's what he says."



     "Wants to read, does he?--ain't satisfied with a thousand candles,

     but has to have a lamp!--I do wonder what the devil that fellow

     wants that lamp for?  Take him another candle, and then if----"



     "But he wants the lamp--says he'll burn the d--d old house down if

     he don't get a lamp!" (a remark which I never made.)



     "I'd like to see him at it once.  Well, you take it along--but I

     swear it beats my time, though--and see if you can't find out what

     in the very nation he wants with that lamp."



     And he went off growling to himself and still wondering and

     wondering over the unaccountable conduct of No. 15.  The lamp was a

     good one, but it revealed some disagreeable things--a bed in the

     suburbs of a desert of room--a bed that had hills and valleys in it,

     and you'd have to accommodate your body to the impression left in it

     by the man that slept there last, before you could lie comfortably;

     a carpet that had seen better days; a melancholy washstand in a

     remote corner, and a dejected pitcher on it sorrowing over a broken

     nose; a looking-glass split across the centre, which chopped your

     head off at the chin and made you look like some dreadful unfinished

     monster or other; the paper peeling in shreds from the walls.



     I sighed and said: "This is charming; and now don't you think you

     could get me something to read?"



     The porter said, "Oh, certainly; the old man's got dead loads of

     books;" and he was gone before I could tell him what sort of

     literature I would rather have.  And yet his countenance expressed

     the utmost confidence in his ability to execute the commission with

     credit to himself.  The old man made a descent on him.



     "What are you going to do with that pile of books?"



     "Fifteen wants 'em, sir."



     "Fifteen, is it?  He'll want a warming-pan, next--he'll want a

     nurse!  Take him every thing there is in the house--take him the

     bar-keeper--take him the baggage-wagon--take him a chamber-maid!

     Confound me, I never saw any thing like it.  What did he say he

     wants with those books?"



     "Wants to read 'em, like enough; it ain't likely he wants to eat

     'em, I don't reckon."



     "Wants to read 'em--wants to read 'em this time of night, the

     infernal lunatic!  Well, he can't have them."



     "But he says he's mor'ly bound to have 'em; he says he'll just go a-

     rairin' and a-chargin' through this house and raise more--well,

     there's no tellin' what he won't do if he don't get 'em; because

     he's drunk and crazy and desperate, and nothing'll soothe him down

     but them cussed books."  [I had not made any threats, and was not in

     the condition ascribed to me by the porter.]



     "Well, go on; but I will be around when he goes to rairing and

     charging, and the first rair he makes I'll make him rair out of the

     window."  And then the old gentleman went off, growling as before.



     The genius of that porter was something wonderful.  He put an armful

     of books on the bed and said "Good night" as confidently as if he

     knew perfectly well that those books were exactly my style of

     reading matter.  And well he might.  His selection covered the whole

     range of legitimate literature.  It comprised "The Great

     Consummation," by Rev. Dr. Cummings--theology; "Revised Statutes of

     the State of Missouri"--law; "The Complete Horse-Doctor"--medicine;

     "The Toilers of the Sea," by Victor Hugo--romance; "The works of

     William Shakspeare"--poetry.  I shall never cease to admire the tact

     and the intelligence of that gifted porter.



But all the donkeys in Christendom, and most of the Egyptian boys, I

think, are at the door, and there is some noise going on, not to put it

in stronger language.--We are about starting to the illustrious Pyramids

of Egypt, and the donkeys for the voyage are under inspection.  I will go

and select one before the choice animals are all taken.









CHAPTER LVIII.



The donkeys were all good, all handsome, all strong and in good

condition, all fast and all willing to prove it.  They were the best we

had found any where, and the most 'recherche'.  I do not know what

'recherche' is, but that is what these donkeys were, anyhow.  Some were

of a soft mouse-color, and the others were white, black, and vari-

colored.  Some were close-shaven, all over, except that a tuft like a

paint-brush was left on the end of the tail.  Others were so shaven in

fanciful landscape garden patterns, as to mark their bodies with curving

lines, which were bounded on one side by hair and on the other by the

close plush left by the shears.  They had all been newly barbered, and

were exceedingly stylish.  Several of the white ones were barred like

zebras with rainbow stripes of blue and red and yellow paint.  These were

indescribably gorgeous.  Dan and Jack selected from this lot because they

brought back Italian reminiscences of the "old masters."  The saddles

were the high, stuffy, frog-shaped things we had known in Ephesus and

Smyrna.  The donkey-boys were lively young Egyptian rascals who could

follow a donkey and keep him in a canter half a day without tiring.  We

had plenty of spectators when we mounted, for the hotel was full of

English people bound overland to India and officers getting ready for the

African campaign against the Abyssinian King Theodorus.  We were not a

very large party, but as we charged through the streets of the great

metropolis, we made noise for five hundred, and displayed activity and

created excitement in proportion.  Nobody can steer a donkey, and some

collided with camels, dervishes, effendis, asses, beggars and every thing

else that offered to the donkeys a reasonable chance for a collision.

When we turned into the broad avenue that leads out of the city toward

Old Cairo, there was plenty of room.  The walls of stately date-palms

that fenced the gardens and bordered the way, threw their shadows down

and made the air cool and bracing.  We rose to the spirit of the time and

the race became a wild rout, a stampede, a terrific panic.  I wish to

live to enjoy it again.



Somewhere along this route we had a few startling exhibitions of Oriental

simplicity.  A girl apparently thirteen years of age came along the great

thoroughfare dressed like Eve before the fall.  We would have called her

thirteen at home; but here girls who look thirteen are often not more

than nine, in reality.  Occasionally we saw stark-naked men of superb

build, bathing, and making no attempt at concealment.  However, an hour's

acquaintance with this cheerful custom reconciled the pilgrims to it, and

then it ceased to occasion remark.  Thus easily do even the most

startling novelties grow tame and spiritless to these sight-surfeited

wanderers.



Arrived at Old Cairo, the camp-followers took up the donkeys and tumbled

them bodily aboard a small boat with a lateen sail, and we followed and

got under way.  The deck was closely packed with donkeys and men; the two

sailors had to climb over and under and through the wedged mass to work

the sails, and the steersman had to crowd four or five donkeys out of the

way when he wished to swing his tiller and put his helm hard-down.  But

what were their troubles to us?  We had nothing to do; nothing to do but

enjoy the trip; nothing to do but shove the donkeys off our corns and

look at the charming scenery of the Nile.



On the island at our right was the machine they call the Nilometer, a

stone-column whose business it is to mark the rise of the river and

prophecy whether it will reach only thirty-two feet and produce a famine,

or whether it will properly flood the land at forty and produce plenty,

or whether it will rise to forty-three and bring death and destruction to

flocks and crops--but how it does all this they could not explain to us

so that we could understand.  On the same island is still shown the spot

where Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the bulrushes.  Near the spot we

sailed from, the Holy Family dwelt when they sojourned in Egypt till

Herod should complete his slaughter of the innocents.  The same tree they

rested under when they first arrived, was there a short time ago, but the

Viceroy of Egypt sent it to the Empress Eugenie lately.  He was just in

time, otherwise our pilgrims would have had it.



The Nile at this point is muddy, swift and turbid, and does not lack a

great deal of being as wide as the Mississippi.



We scrambled up the steep bank at the shabby town of Ghizeh, mounted the

donkeys again, and scampered away.  For four or five miles the route lay

along a high embankment which they say is to be the bed of a railway the

Sultan means to build for no other reason than that when the Empress of

the French comes to visit him she can go to the Pyramids in comfort.

This is true Oriental hospitality.  I am very glad it is our privilege to

have donkeys instead of cars.



At the distance of a few miles the Pyramids rising above the palms,

looked very clean-cut, very grand and imposing, and very soft and filmy,

as well.  They swam in a rich haze that took from them all suggestions of

unfeeling stone, and made them seem only the airy nothings of a dream--

structures which might blossom into tiers of vague arches, or ornate

colonnades, may be, and change and change again, into all graceful forms

of architecture, while we looked, and then melt deliciously away and

blend with the tremulous atmosphere.



At the end of the levee we left the mules and went in a sailboat across

an arm of the Nile or an overflow, and landed where the sands of the

Great Sahara left their embankment, as straight as a wall, along the

verge of the alluvial plain of the river.  A laborious walk in the

flaming sun brought us to the foot of the great Pyramid of Cheops.  It

was a fairy vision no longer.  It was a corrugated, unsightly mountain of

stone.  Each of its monstrous sides was a wide stairway which rose

upward, step above step, narrowing as it went, till it tapered to a point

far aloft in the air.  Insect men and women--pilgrims from the Quaker

City--were creeping about its dizzy perches, and one little black swarm

were waving postage stamps from the airy summit--handkerchiefs will be

understood.



Of course we were besieged by a rabble of muscular Egyptians and Arabs

who wanted the contract of dragging us to the top--all tourists are.  Of

course you could not hear your own voice for the din that was around you.

Of course the Sheiks said they were the only responsible parties; that

all contracts must be made with them, all moneys paid over to them, and

none exacted from us by any but themselves alone.  Of course they

contracted that the varlets who dragged us up should not mention

bucksheesh once.  For such is the usual routine.  Of course we contracted

with them, paid them, were delivered into the hands of the draggers,

dragged up the Pyramids, and harried and be-deviled for bucksheesh from

the foundation clear to the summit.  We paid it, too, for we were

purposely spread very far apart over the vast side of the Pyramid.  There

was no help near if we called, and the Herculeses who dragged us had a

way of asking sweetly and flatteringly for bucksheesh, which was

seductive, and of looking fierce and threatening to throw us down the

precipice, which was persuasive and convincing.



Each step being full as high as a dinner-table; there being very, very

many of the steps; an Arab having hold of each of our arms and springing

upward from step to step and snatching us with them, forcing us to lift

our feet as high as our breasts every time, and do it rapidly and keep it

up till we were ready to faint, who shall say it is not lively,

exhilarating, lacerating, muscle-straining, bone-wrenching and perfectly

excruciating and exhausting pastime, climbing the Pyramids?  I beseeched

the varlets not to twist all my joints asunder; I iterated, reiterated,

even swore to them that I did not wish to beat any body to the top; did

all I could to convince them that if I got there the last of all I would

feel blessed above men and grateful to them forever; I begged them,

prayed them, pleaded with them to let me stop and rest a moment--only one

little moment: and they only answered with some more frightful springs,

and an unenlisted volunteer behind opened a bombardment of determined

boosts with his head which threatened to batter my whole political

economy to wreck and ruin.



Twice, for one minute, they let me rest while they extorted bucksheesh,

and then continued their maniac flight up the Pyramid.  They wished to

beat the other parties.  It was nothing to them that I, a stranger, must

be sacrificed upon the altar of their unholy ambition.  But in the midst

of sorrow, joy blooms.  Even in this dark hour I had a sweet consolation.

For I knew that except these Mohammedans repented they would go straight

to perdition some day.  And they never repent--they never forsake their

paganism.  This thought calmed me, cheered me, and I sank down, limp and

exhausted, upon the summit, but happy, so happy and serene within.



On the one hand, a mighty sea of yellow sand stretched away toward the

ends of the earth, solemn, silent, shorn of vegetation, its solitude

uncheered by any forms of creature life; on the other, the Eden of Egypt

was spread below us--a broad green floor, cloven by the sinuous river,

dotted with villages, its vast distances measured and marked by the

diminishing stature of receding clusters of palms.  It lay asleep in an

enchanted atmosphere.  There was no sound, no motion.  Above the date-

plumes in the middle distance, swelled a domed and pinnacled mass,

glimmering through a tinted, exquisite mist; away toward the horizon a

dozen shapely pyramids watched over ruined Memphis: and at our feet the

bland impassible Sphynx looked out upon the picture from her throne in

the sands as placidly and pensively as she had looked upon its like full

fifty lagging centuries ago.



We suffered torture no pen can describe from the hungry appeals for

bucksheesh that gleamed from Arab eyes and poured incessantly from Arab

lips.  Why try to call up the traditions of vanished Egyptian grandeur;

why try to fancy Egypt following dead Rameses to his tomb in the Pyramid,

or the long multitude of Israel departing over the desert yonder?  Why

try to think at all?  The thing was impossible.  One must bring his

meditations cut and dried, or else cut and dry them afterward.



The traditional Arab proposed, in the traditional way, to run down

Cheops, cross the eighth of a mile of sand intervening between it and the

tall pyramid of Cephron, ascend to Cephron's summit and return to us on

the top of Cheops--all in nine minutes by the watch, and the whole

service to be rendered for a single dollar.  In the first flush of

irritation, I said let the Arab and his exploits go to the mischief.

But stay.  The upper third of Cephron was coated with dressed marble,

smooth as glass.  A blessed thought entered my brain.  He must infallibly

break his neck.  Close the contract with dispatch, I said, and let him

go.  He started.  We watched.  He went bounding down the vast broadside,

spring after spring, like an ibex.  He grew small and smaller till he

became a bobbing pigmy, away down toward the bottom--then disappeared.

We turned and peered over the other side--forty seconds--eighty seconds--

a hundred--happiness, he is dead already!--two minutes--and a quarter--

"There he goes!"  Too true--it was too true.  He was very small, now.

Gradually, but surely, he overcame the level ground.  He began to spring

and climb again.  Up, up, up--at last he reached the smooth coating--now

for it.  But he clung to it with toes and fingers, like a fly.  He

crawled this way and that--away to the right, slanting upward--away to

the left, still slanting upward--and stood at last, a black peg on the

summit, and waved his pigmy scarf!  Then he crept downward to the raw

steps again, then picked up his agile heels and flew.  We lost him

presently.  But presently again we saw him under us, mounting with

undiminished energy.  Shortly he bounded into our midst with a gallant

war-whoop.  Time, eight minutes, forty-one seconds.  He had won.  His

bones were intact.  It was a failure.  I reflected.  I said to myself, he

is tired, and must grow dizzy.  I will risk another dollar on him.



He started again.  Made the trip again.  Slipped on the smooth coating

--I almost had him.  But an infamous crevice saved him.  He was with us

once more--perfectly sound.  Time, eight minutes, forty-six seconds.



I said to Dan, "Lend me a dollar--I can beat this game, yet."



Worse and worse.  He won again.  Time, eight minutes, forty-eight

seconds.  I was out of all patience, now.  I was desperate.--Money was

no longer of any consequence.  I said, "Sirrah, I will give you a hundred

dollars to jump off this pyramid head first.  If you do not like the

terms, name your bet.  I scorn to stand on expenses now.  I will stay

right here and risk money on you as long as Dan has got a cent."



I was in a fair way to win, now, for it was a dazzling opportunity for an

Arab.  He pondered a moment, and would have done it, I think, but his

mother arrived, then, and interfered.  Her tears moved me--I never can

look upon the tears of woman with indifference--and I said I would give

her a hundred to jump off, too.



But it was a failure.  The Arabs are too high-priced in Egypt.  They put

on airs unbecoming to such savages.



We descended, hot and out of humor.  The dragoman lit candles, and we all

entered a hole near the base of the pyramid, attended by a crazy rabble

of Arabs who thrust their services upon us uninvited.  They dragged us up

a long inclined chute, and dripped candle-grease all over us.  This chute

was not more than twice as wide and high as a Saratoga trunk, and was

walled, roofed and floored with solid blocks of Egyptian granite as wide

as a wardrobe, twice as thick and three times as long.  We kept on

climbing, through the oppressive gloom, till I thought we ought to be

nearing the top of the pyramid again, and then came to the "Queen's

Chamber," and shortly to the Chamber of the King.  These large apartments

were tombs.  The walls were built of monstrous masses of smoothed

granite, neatly joined together.  Some of them were nearly as large

square as an ordinary parlor.  A great stone sarcophagus like a bath-tub

stood in the centre of the King's Chamber.  Around it were gathered a

picturesque group of Arab savages and soiled and tattered pilgrims, who

held their candles aloft in the gloom while they chattered, and the

winking blurs of light shed a dim glory down upon one of the

irrepressible memento-seekers who was pecking at the venerable

sarcophagus with his sacrilegious hammer.



We struggled out to the open air and the bright sunshine, and for the

space of thirty minutes received ragged Arabs by couples, dozens and

platoons, and paid them bucksheesh for services they swore and proved by

each other that they had rendered, but which we had not been aware of

before--and as each party was paid, they dropped into the rear of the

procession and in due time arrived again with a newly-invented delinquent

list for liquidation.



We lunched in the shade of the pyramid, and in the midst of this

encroaching and unwelcome company, and then Dan and Jack and I started

away for a walk.  A howling swarm of beggars followed us--surrounded us--

almost headed us off.  A sheik, in flowing white bournous and gaudy head-

gear, was with them.  He wanted more bucksheesh.  But we had adopted a

new code--it was millions for defense, but not a cent for bucksheesh.  I

asked him if he could persuade the others to depart if we paid him.  He

said yes--for ten francs.  We accepted the contract, and said--



"Now persuade your vassals to fall back."



He swung his long staff round his head and three Arabs bit the dust.  He

capered among the mob like a very maniac.  His blows fell like hail, and

wherever one fell a subject went down.  We had to hurry to the rescue and

tell him it was only necessary to damage them a little, he need not kill

them.--In two minutes we were alone with the sheik, and remained so.

The persuasive powers of this illiterate savage were remarkable.



Each side of the Pyramid of Cheops is about as long as the Capitol at

Washington, or the Sultan's new palace on the Bosporus, and is longer

than the greatest depth of St. Peter's at Rome--which is to say that each

side of Cheops extends seven hundred and some odd feet.  It is about

seventy-five feet higher than the cross on St. Peter's.  The first time I

ever went down the Mississippi, I thought the highest bluff on the river

between St. Louis and New Orleans--it was near Selma, Missouri--was

probably the highest mountain in the world.  It is four hundred and

thirteen feet high.  It still looms in my memory with undiminished

grandeur.  I can still see the trees and bushes growing smaller and

smaller as I followed them up its huge slant with my eye, till they

became a feathery fringe on the distant summit.  This symmetrical Pyramid

of Cheops--this solid mountain of stone reared by the patient hands of

men--this mighty tomb of a forgotten monarch--dwarfs my cherished

mountain.  For it is four hundred and eighty feet high.  In still earlier

years than those I have been recalling, Holliday's Hill, in our town, was

to me the noblest work of God.  It appeared to pierce the skies.  It was

nearly three hundred feet high.  In those days I pondered the subject

much, but I never could understand why it did not swathe its summit with

never-failing clouds, and crown its majestic brow with everlasting snows.

I had heard that such was the custom of great mountains in other parts of

the world.  I remembered how I worked with another boy, at odd afternoons

stolen from study and paid for with stripes, to undermine and start from

its bed an immense boulder that rested upon the edge of that hilltop; I

remembered how, one Saturday afternoon, we gave three hours of honest

effort to the task, and saw at last that our reward was at hand; I

remembered how we sat down, then, and wiped the perspiration away, and

waited to let a picnic party get out of the way in the road below--and

then we started the boulder.  It was splendid.  It went crashing down the

hillside, tearing up saplings, mowing bushes down like grass, ripping and

crushing and smashing every thing in its path--eternally splintered and

scattered a wood pile at the foot of the hill, and then sprang from the

high bank clear over a dray in the road--the negro glanced up once and

dodged--and the next second it made infinitesimal mince-meat of a frame

cooper-shop, and the coopers swarmed out like bees.  Then we said it was

perfectly magnificent, and left.  Because the coopers were starting up

the hill to inquire.



Still, that mountain, prodigious as it was, was nothing to the Pyramid of

Cheops.  I could conjure up no comparison that would convey to my mind a

satisfactory comprehension of the magnitude of a pile of monstrous stones

that covered thirteen acres of ground and stretched upward four hundred

and eighty tiresome feet, and so I gave it up and walked down to the

Sphynx.



After years of waiting, it was before me at last.  The great face was so

sad, so earnest, so longing, so patient.  There was a dignity not of

earth in its mien, and in its countenance a benignity such as never any

thing human wore.  It was stone, but it seemed sentient.  If ever image

of stone thought, it was thinking.  It was looking toward the verge of

the landscape, yet looking at nothing--nothing but distance and vacancy.

It was looking over and beyond every thing of the present, and far into

the past.  It was gazing out over the ocean of Time--over lines of

century-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer and

nearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide, away toward

the horizon of remote antiquity.  It was thinking of the wars of departed

ages; of the empires it had seen created and destroyed; of the nations

whose birth it had witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whose

annihilation it had noted; of the joy and sorrow, the life and death, the

grandeur and decay, of five thousand slow revolving years.  It was the

type of an attribute of man--of a faculty of his heart and brain.  It was

MEMORY--RETROSPECTION--wrought into visible, tangible form.  All who know

what pathos there is in memories of days that are accomplished and faces

that have vanished--albeit only a trifling score of years gone by--will

have some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave eyes that

look so steadfastly back upon the things they knew before History was

born--before Tradition had being--things that were, and forms that moved,

in a vague era which even Poetry and Romance scarce know of--and passed

one by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the midst of a

strange new age, and uncomprehended scenes.



The Sphynx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its magnitude;

it is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its story.  And there is

that in the overshadowing majesty of this eternal figure of stone, with

its accusing memory of the deeds of all ages, which reveals to one

something of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the awful

presence of God.



There are some things which, for the credit of America, should be left

unsaid, perhaps; but these very things happen sometimes to be the very

things which, for the real benefit of Americans, ought to have prominent

notice.  While we stood looking, a wart, or an excrescence of some kind,

appeared on the jaw of the Sphynx.  We heard the familiar clink of a

hammer, and understood the case at once.  One of our well meaning

reptiles--I mean relic-hunters--had crawled up there and was trying to

break a "specimen" from the face of this the most majestic creation the

hand of man has wrought.  But the great image contemplated the dead ages

as calmly as ever, unconscious of the small insect that was fretting at

its jaw.  Egyptian granite that has defied the storms and earthquakes of

all time has nothing to fear from the tack-hammers of ignorant

excursionists--highwaymen like this specimen.  He failed in his

enterprise.  We sent a sheik to arrest him if he had the authority, or to

warn him, if he had not, that by the laws of Egypt the crime he was

attempting to commit was punishable with imprisonment or the bastinado.

Then he desisted and went away.



The Sphynx: a hundred and twenty-five feet long, sixty feet high, and a

hundred and two feet around the head, if I remember rightly--carved out

of one solid block of stone harder than any iron.  The block must have

been as large as the Fifth Avenue Hotel before the usual waste (by the

necessities of sculpture) of a fourth or a half of the original mass was

begun.  I only set down these figures and these remarks to suggest the

prodigious labor the carving of it so elegantly, so symmetrically, so

faultlessly, must have cost.  This species of stone is so hard that

figures cut in it remain sharp and unmarred after exposure to the weather

for two or three thousand years.  Now did it take a hundred years of

patient toil to carve the Sphynx?  It seems probable.



Something interfered, and we did not visit the Red Sea and walk upon the

sands of Arabia.  I shall not describe the great mosque of Mehemet Ali,

whose entire inner walls are built of polished and glistening alabaster;

I shall not tell how the little birds have built their nests in the

globes of the great chandeliers that hang in the mosque, and how they

fill the whole place with their music and are not afraid of any body

because their audacity is pardoned, their rights are respected, and

nobody is allowed to interfere with them, even though the mosque be thus

doomed to go unlighted; I certainly shall not tell the hackneyed story of

the massacre of the Mamelukes, because I am glad the lawless rascals were

massacred, and I do not wish to get up any sympathy in their behalf; I

shall not tell how that one solitary Mameluke jumped his horse a hundred

feet down from the battlements of the citadel and escaped, because I do

not think much of that--I could have done it myself; I shall not tell of

Joseph's well which he dug in the solid rock of the citadel hill and

which is still as good as new, nor how the same mules he bought to draw

up the water (with an endless chain) are still at it yet and are getting

tired of it, too; I shall not tell about Joseph's granaries which he

built to store the grain in, what time the Egyptian brokers were "selling

short," unwitting that there would be no corn in all the land when it

should be time for them to deliver; I shall not tell any thing about the

strange, strange city of Cairo, because it is only a repetition, a good

deal intensified and exaggerated, of the Oriental cities I have already

spoken of; I shall not tell of the Great Caravan which leaves for Mecca

every year, for I did not see it; nor of the fashion the people have of

prostrating themselves and so forming a long human pavement to be ridden

over by the chief of the expedition on its return, to the end that their

salvation may be thus secured, for I did not see that either; I shall not

speak of the railway, for it is like any other railway--I shall only say

that the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies three

thousand years old, purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for that

purpose, and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call out

pettishly, "D--n these plebeians, they don't burn worth a cent--pass out

a King;"--[Stated to me for a fact.  I only tell it as I got it.  I am

willing to believe it.  I can believe any thing.]--I shall not tell of

the groups of mud cones stuck like wasps' nests upon a thousand mounds

above high water-mark the length and breadth of Egypt--villages of the

lower classes; I shall not speak of the boundless sweep of level plain,

green with luxuriant grain, that gladdens the eye as far as it can pierce

through the soft, rich atmosphere of Egypt; I shall not speak of the

vision of the Pyramids seen at a distance of five and twenty miles, for

the picture is too ethereal to be limned by an uninspired pen; I shall

not tell of the crowds of dusky women who flocked to the cars when they

stopped a moment at a station, to sell us a drink of water or a ruddy,

juicy pomegranate; I shall not tell of the motley multitudes and wild

costumes that graced a fair we found in full blast at another barbarous

station; I shall not tell how we feasted on fresh dates and enjoyed the

pleasant landscape all through the flying journey; nor how we thundered

into Alexandria, at last, swarmed out of the cars, rowed aboard the ship,

left a comrade behind, (who was to return to Europe, thence home,) raised

the anchor, and turned our bows homeward finally and forever from the

long voyage; nor how, as the mellow sun went down upon the oldest land on

earth, Jack and Moult assembled in solemn state in the smoking-room and

mourned over the lost comrade the whole night long, and would not be

comforted.  I shall not speak a word of any of these things, or write a

line.  They shall be as a sealed book.  I do not know what a sealed book

is, because I never saw one, but a sealed book is the expression to use

in this connection, because it is popular.



We were glad to have seen the land which was the mother of civilization--

which taught Greece her letters, and through Greece Rome, and through

Rome the world; the land which could have humanized and civilized the

hapless children of Israel, but allowed them to depart out of her borders

little better than savages.  We were glad to have seen that land which

had an enlightened religion with future eternal rewards and punishment in

it, while even Israel's religion contained no promise of a hereafter.

We were glad to have seen that land which had glass three thousand years

before England had it, and could paint upon it as none of us can paint

now; that land which knew, three thousand years ago, well nigh all of

medicine and surgery which science has discovered lately; which had all

those curious surgical instruments which science has invented recently;

which had in high excellence a thousand luxuries and necessities of an

advanced civilization which we have gradually contrived and accumulated

in modern times and claimed as things that were new under the sun; that

had paper untold centuries before we dreampt of it--and waterfalls before

our women thought of them; that had a perfect system of common schools so

long before we boasted of our achievements in that direction that it

seems forever and forever ago; that so embalmed the dead that flesh was

made almost immortal--which we can not do; that built temples which mock

at destroying time and smile grimly upon our lauded little prodigies of

architecture; that old land that knew all which we know now, perchance,

and more; that walked in the broad highway of civilization in the gray

dawn of creation, ages and ages before we were born; that left the

impress of exalted, cultivated Mind upon the eternal front of the Sphynx

to confound all scoffers who, when all her other proofs had passed away,

might seek to persuade the world that imperial Egypt, in the days of her

high renown, had groped in darkness.









CHAPTER LIX.



We were at sea now, for a very long voyage--we were to pass through the

entire length of the Levant; through the entire length of the

Mediterranean proper, also, and then cross the full width of the

Atlantic--a voyage of several weeks.  We naturally settled down into a

very slow, stay-at-home manner of life, and resolved to be quiet,

exemplary people, and roam no more for twenty or thirty days.  No more,

at least, than from stem to stern of the ship.  It was a very comfortable

prospect, though, for we were tired and needed a long rest.



We were all lazy and satisfied, now, as the meager entries in my note-

book (that sure index, to me, of my condition,) prove.  What a stupid

thing a note-book gets to be at sea, any way.  Please observe the style:



     "Sunday--Services, as usual, at four bells.  Services at night,

     also.  No cards.



     "Monday--Beautiful day, but rained hard.  The cattle purchased at

     Alexandria for beef ought to be shingled.  Or else fattened.  The

     water stands in deep puddles in the depressions forward of their

     after shoulders.  Also here and there all over their backs.  It is

     well they are not cows--it would soak in and ruin the milk.  The

     poor devil eagle--[Afterwards presented to the Central Park.]--from

     Syria looks miserable and droopy in the rain, perched on the forward

     capstan.  He appears to have his own opinion of a sea voyage, and if

     it were put into language and the language solidified, it would

     probably essentially dam the widest river in the world.



     "Tuesday--Somewhere in the neighborhood of the island of Malta.  Can

     not stop there.  Cholera.  Weather very stormy.  Many passengers

     seasick and invisible.



     "Wednesday--Weather still very savage.  Storm blew two land birds to

     sea, and they came on board.  A hawk was blown off, also.  He

     circled round and round the ship, wanting to light, but afraid of

     the people.  He was so tired, though, that he had to light, at last,

     or perish.  He stopped in the foretop, repeatedly, and was as often

     blown away by the wind.  At last Harry caught him.  Sea full of

     flying-fish.  They rise in flocks of three hundred and flash along

     above the tops of the waves a distance of two or three hundred feet,

     then fall and disappear.



     "Thursday--Anchored off Algiers, Africa.  Beautiful city, beautiful

     green hilly landscape behind it.  Staid half a day and left.  Not

     permitted to land, though we showed a clean bill of health.  They

     were afraid of Egyptian plague and cholera.



     "Friday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,

     promenading the deck.  Afterwards, charades.



     "Saturday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,

     promenading the decks.  Afterwards, dominoes.



     "Sunday--Morning service, four bells.  Evening service, eight bells.

     Monotony till midnight.--Whereupon, dominoes.



     "Monday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,

     promenading the decks.  Afterward, charades and a lecture from Dr.

     C. Dominoes.



     "No date--Anchored off the picturesque city of Cagliari, Sardinia.

     Staid till midnight, but not permitted to land by these infamous

     foreigners.  They smell inodorously--they do not wash--they dare not

     risk cholera.



     "Thursday--Anchored off the beautiful cathedral city of Malaga,

     Spain.--Went ashore in the captain's boat--not ashore, either, for

     they would not let us land.  Quarantine.  Shipped my newspaper

     correspondence, which they took with tongs, dipped it in sea water,

     clipped it full of holes, and then fumigated it with villainous

     vapors till it smelt like a Spaniard.  Inquired about chances to run

     to blockade and visit the Alhambra at Granada.  Too risky--they

     might hang a body.  Set sail--middle of afternoon.



     "And so on, and so on, and so forth, for several days.  Finally,

     anchored off Gibraltar, which looks familiar and home-like."



It reminds me of the journal I opened with the New Year, once, when I was

a boy and a confiding and a willing prey to those impossible schemes of

reform which well-meaning old maids and grandmothers set for the feet of

unwary youths at that season of the year--setting oversized tasks for

them, which, necessarily failing, as infallibly weaken the boy's strength

of will, diminish his confidence in himself and injure his chances of

success in life.  Please accept of an extract:



     "Monday--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Tuesday--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Wednesday--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Thursday--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Friday--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Next Friday--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Friday fortnight--Got up, washed, went to bed.

     "Following month--Got up, washed, went to bed."



I stopped, then, discouraged.  Startling events appeared to be too rare,

in my career, to render a diary necessary.  I still reflect with pride,

however, that even at that early age I washed when I got up.  That

journal finished me.  I never have had the nerve to keep one since.  My

loss of confidence in myself in that line was permanent.



The ship had to stay a week or more at Gibraltar to take in coal for the

home voyage.



It would be very tiresome staying here, and so four of us ran the

quarantine blockade and spent seven delightful days in Seville, Cordova,

Cadiz, and wandering through the pleasant rural scenery of Andalusia, the

garden of Old Spain.  The experiences of that cheery week were too varied

and numerous for a short chapter and I have not room for a long one.

Therefore I shall leave them all out.









CHAPTER LX.



Ten or eleven o'clock found us coming down to breakfast one morning in

Cadiz.  They told us the ship had been lying at anchor in the harbor two

or three hours.  It was time for us to bestir ourselves.  The ship could

wait only a little while because of the quarantine.  We were soon on

board, and within the hour the white city and the pleasant shores of

Spain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight.  We had seen no

land fade from view so regretfully.



It had long ago been decided in a noisy public meeting in the main cabin

that we could not go to Lisbon, because we must surely be quarantined

there.  We did every thing by mass-meeting, in the good old national way,

from swapping off one empire for another on the programme of the voyage

down to complaining of the cookery and the scarcity of napkins.  I am

reminded, now, of one of these complaints of the cookery made by a

passenger.  The coffee had been steadily growing more and more execrable

for the space of three weeks, till at last it had ceased to be coffee

altogether and had assumed the nature of mere discolored water--so this

person said.  He said it was so weak that it was transparent an inch in

depth around the edge of the cup.  As he approached the table one morning

he saw the transparent edge--by means of his extraordinary vision long

before he got to his seat.  He went back and complained in a high-handed

way to Capt.  Duncan.  He said the coffee was disgraceful.  The Captain

showed his.  It seemed tolerably good.  The incipient mutineer was more

outraged than ever, then, at what he denounced as the partiality shown

the captain's table over the other tables in the ship.  He flourished

back and got his cup and set it down triumphantly, and said:



"Just try that mixture once, Captain Duncan."



He smelt it--tasted it--smiled benignantly--then said:



"It is inferior--for coffee--but it is pretty fair tea."



The humbled mutineer smelt it, tasted it, and returned to his seat.  He

had made an egregious ass of himself before the whole ship.  He did it no

more.  After that he took things as they came.  That was me.



The old-fashioned ship-life had returned, now that we were no longer in

sight of land.  For days and days it continued just the same, one day

being exactly like another, and, to me, every one of them pleasant.  At

last we anchored in the open roadstead of Funchal, in the beautiful

islands we call the Madeiras.



The mountains looked surpassingly lovely, clad as they were in living,

green; ribbed with lava ridges; flecked with white cottages; riven by

deep chasms purple with shade; the great slopes dashed with sunshine and

mottled with shadows flung from the drifting squadrons of the sky, and

the superb picture fitly crowned by towering peaks whose fronts were

swept by the trailing fringes of the clouds.



But we could not land.  We staid all day and looked, we abused the man

who invented quarantine, we held half a dozen mass-meetings and crammed

them full of interrupted speeches, motions that fell still-born,

amendments that came to nought and resolutions that died from sheer

exhaustion in trying to get before the house.  At night we set sail.



We averaged four mass-meetings a week for the voyage--we seemed always in

labor in this way, and yet so often fallaciously that whenever at long

intervals we were safely delivered of a resolution, it was cause for

public rejoicing, and we hoisted the flag and fired a salute.



Days passed--and nights; and then the beautiful Bermudas rose out of the

sea, we entered the tortuous channel, steamed hither and thither among

the bright summer islands, and rested at last under the flag of England

and were welcome.  We were not a nightmare here, where were civilization

and intelligence in place of Spanish and Italian superstition, dirt and

dread of cholera.  A few days among the breezy groves, the flower

gardens, the coral caves, and the lovely vistas of blue water that went

curving in and out, disappearing and anon again appearing through jungle

walls of brilliant foliage, restored the energies dulled by long drowsing

on the ocean, and fitted us for our final cruise--our little run of a

thousand miles to New York--America--HOME.



We bade good-bye to "our friends the Bermudians," as our programme hath

it--the majority of those we were most intimate with were negroes--and

courted the great deep again.  I said the majority.  We knew more negroes

than white people, because we had a deal of washing to be done, but we

made some most excellent friends among the whites, whom it will be a

pleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance.



We sailed, and from that hour all idling ceased.  Such another system of

overhauling, general littering of cabins and packing of trunks we had not

seen since we let go the anchor in the harbor of Beirout.  Every body was

busy.  Lists of all purchases had to be made out, and values attached, to

facilitate matters at the custom-house.  Purchases bought by bulk in

partnership had to be equitably divided, outstanding debts canceled,

accounts compared, and trunks, boxes and packages labeled.  All day long

the bustle and confusion continued.



And now came our first accident.  A passenger was running through a

gangway, between decks, one stormy night, when he caught his foot in the

iron staple of a door that had been heedlessly left off a hatchway, and

the bones of his leg broke at the ancle.  It was our first serious

misfortune.  We had traveled much more than twenty thousand miles, by

land and sea, in many trying climates, without a single hurt, without a

serious case of sickness and without a death among five and sixty

passengers.  Our good fortune had been wonderful.  A sailor had jumped

overboard at Constantinople one night, and was seen no more, but it was

suspected that his object was to desert, and there was a slim chance, at

least, that he reached the shore.  But the passenger list was complete.

There was no name missing from the register.



At last, one pleasant morning, we steamed up the harbor of New York, all

on deck, all dressed in Christian garb--by special order, for there was a

latent disposition in some quarters to come out as Turks--and amid a

waving of handkerchiefs from welcoming friends, the glad pilgrims noted

the shiver of the decks that told that ship and pier had joined hands

again and the long, strange cruise was over.  Amen.









CHAPTER LXI.



In this place I will print an article which I wrote for the New York

Herald the night we arrived.  I do it partly because my contract with my

publishers makes it compulsory; partly because it is a proper, tolerably

accurate, and exhaustive summing up of the cruise of the ship and the

performances of the pilgrims in foreign lands; and partly because some of

the passengers have abused me for writing it, and I wish the public to

see how thankless a task it is to put one's self to trouble to glorify

unappreciative people.  I was charged with "rushing into print" with

these compliments.  I did not rush.  I had written news letters to the

Herald sometimes, but yet when I visited the office that day I did not

say any thing about writing a valedictory.  I did go to the Tribune

office to see if such an article was wanted, because I belonged on the

regular staff of that paper and it was simply a duty to do it.  The

managing editor was absent, and so I thought no more about it.  At night

when the Herald's request came for an article, I did not "rush."  In

fact, I demurred for a while, because I did not feel like writing

compliments then, and therefore was afraid to speak of the cruise lest I

might be betrayed into using other than complimentary language.  However,

I reflected that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and

write a kind word for the Hadjis--Hadjis are people who have made the

pilgrimage--because parties not interested could not do it so feelingly

as I, a fellow-Hadji, and so I penned the valedictory.  I have read it,

and read it again; and if there is a sentence in it that is not fulsomely

complimentary to captain, ship and passengers, I can not find it.  If it

is not a chapter that any company might be proud to have a body write

about them, my judgment is fit for nothing.  With these remarks I

confidently submit it to the unprejudiced judgment of the reader:



     RETURN OF THE HOLY LAND EXCURSIONISTS--THE STORY OF THE CRUISE.



     TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD:



     The steamer Quaker City has accomplished at last her extraordinary

     voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of Wall street.

     The expedition was a success in some respects, in some it was not.

     Originally it was advertised as a "pleasure excursion."  Well,

     perhaps, it was a pleasure excursion, but certainly it did not look

     like one; certainly it did not act like one.  Any body's and every

     body's notion of a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will

     of a necessity be young and giddy and somewhat boisterous.  They

     will dance a good deal, sing a good deal, make love, but sermonize

     very little.  Any body's and every body's notion of a well conducted

     funeral is that there must be a hearse and a corpse, and chief

     mourners and mourners by courtesy, many old people, much solemnity,

     no levity, and a prayer and a sermon withal.  Three-fourths of the

     Quaker City's passengers were between forty and seventy years of

     age!  There was a picnic crowd for you!  It may be supposed that the

     other fourth was composed of young girls.  But it was not.  It was

     chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six years.

     Let us average the ages of the Quaker City's pilgrims and set the

     figure down as fifty years.  Is any man insane enough to imagine

     that this picnic of patriarchs sang, made love, danced, laughed,

     told anecdotes, dealt in ungodly levity?  In my experience they

     sinned little in these matters.  No doubt it was presumed here at

     home that these frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all

     day, and day after day, and kept up a noisy excitement from one end

     of the ship to the other; and that they played blind-man's buff or

     danced quadrilles and waltzes on moonlight evenings on the quarter-

     deck; and that at odd moments of unoccupied time they jotted a

     laconic item or two in the journals they opened on such an elaborate

     plan when they left home, and then skurried off to their whist and

     euchre labors under the cabin lamps.  If these things were presumed,

     the presumption was at fault.  The venerable excursionists were not

     gay and frisky.  They played no blind-man's buff; they dealt not in

     whist; they shirked not the irksome journal, for alas! most of them

     were even writing books.  They never romped, they talked but little,

     they never sang, save in the nightly prayer-meeting.  The pleasure

     ship was a synagogue, and the pleasure trip was a funeral excursion

     without a corpse.  (There is nothing exhilarating about a funeral

     excursion without a corpse.) A free, hearty laugh was a sound that

     was not heard oftener than once in seven days about those decks or

     in those cabins, and when it was heard it met with precious little

     sympathy.  The excursionists danced, on three separate evenings,

     long, long ago, (it seems an age.) quadrilles, of a single set, made

     up of three ladies and five gentlemen, (the latter with

     handkerchiefs around their arms to signify their sex.) who timed

     their feet to the solemn wheezing of a melodeon; but even this

     melancholy orgie was voted to be sinful, and dancing was

     discontinued.



     The pilgrims played dominoes when too much Josephus or Robinson's

     Holy Land Researches, or book-writing, made recreation necessary--

     for dominoes is about as mild and sinless a game as any in the

     world, perhaps, excepting always the ineffably insipid diversion

     they call croquet, which is a game where you don't pocket any balls

     and don't carom on any thing of any consequence, and when you are

     done nobody has to pay, and there are no refreshments to saw off,

     and, consequently, there isn't any satisfaction whatever about it--

     they played dominoes till they were rested, and then they

     blackguarded each other privately till prayer-time.  When they were

     not seasick they were uncommonly prompt when the dinner-gong

     sounded.  Such was our daily life on board the ship--solemnity,

     decorum, dinner, dominoes, devotions, slander.  It was not lively

     enough for a pleasure trip; but if we had only had a corpse it would

     have made a noble funeral excursion.  It is all over now; but when I

     look back, the idea of these venerable fossils skipping forth on a

     six months' picnic, seems exquisitely refreshing.  The advertised

     title of the expedition--"The Grand Holy Land Pleasure Excursion"--

     was a misnomer.  "The Grand Holy Land Funeral Procession" would have

     been better--much better.



     Wherever we went, in Europe, Asia, or Africa, we made a sensation,

     and, I suppose I may add, created a famine.  None of us had ever

     been any where before; we all hailed from the interior; travel was a

     wild novelty to us, and we conducted ourselves in accordance with

     the natural instincts that were in us, and trammeled ourselves with

     no ceremonies, no conventionalities.  We always took care to make it

     understood that we were Americans--Americans!  When we found that a

     good many foreigners had hardly ever heard of America, and that a

     good many more knew it only as a barbarous province away off

     somewhere, that had lately been at war with somebody, we pitied the

     ignorance of the Old World, but abated no jot of our importance.

     Many and many a simple community in the Eastern hemisphere will

     remember for years the incursion of the strange horde in the year of

     our Lord 1867, that called themselves Americans, and seemed to

     imagine in some unaccountable way that they had a right to be proud

     of it.  We generally created a famine, partly because the coffee on

     the Quaker City was unendurable, and sometimes the more substantial

     fare was not strictly first class; and partly because one naturally

     tires of sitting long at the same board and eating from the same

     dishes.



     The people of those foreign countries are very, very ignorant.  They

     looked curiously at the costumes we had brought from the wilds of

     America.  They observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes.

     They noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we

     conveniently could out of a franc, and wondered where in the

     mischief we came from.  In Paris they just simply opened their eyes

     and stared when we spoke to them in French!  We never did succeed in

     making those idiots understand their own language.  One of our

     passengers said to a shopkeeper, in reference to a proposed return

     to buy a pair of gloves, "Allong restay trankeel--may be ve coom

     Moonday;" and would you believe it, that shopkeeper, a born

     Frenchman, had to ask what it was that had been said.  Sometimes it

     seems to me, somehow, that there must be a difference between

     Parisian French and Quaker City French.



     The people stared at us every where, and we stared at them.  We

     generally made them feel rather small, too, before we got done with

     them, because we bore down on them with America's greatness until we

     crushed them.  And yet we took kindly to the manners and customs,

     and especially to the fashions of the various people we visited.

     When we left the Azores, we wore awful capotes and used fine tooth

     combs--successfully.  When we came back from Tangier, in Africa, we

     were topped with fezzes of the bloodiest hue, hung with tassels like

     an Indian's scalp-lock.  In France and Spain we attracted some

     attention in these costumes.  In Italy they naturally took us for

     distempered Garibaldians, and set a gunboat to look for any thing

     significant in our changes of uniform.  We made Rome howl.  We could

     have made any place howl when we had all our clothes on.  We got no

     fresh raiment in Greece--they had but little there of any kind.  But

     at Constantinople, how we turned out!  Turbans, scimetars, fezzes,

     horse-pistols, tunics, sashes, baggy trowsers, yellow slippers--Oh,

     we were gorgeous!  The illustrious dogs of Constantinople barked

     their under jaws off, and even then failed to do us justice.  They

     are all dead by this time.  They could not go through such a run of

     business as we gave them and survive.



     And then we went to see the Emperor of Russia.  We just called on

     him as comfortably as if we had known him a century or so, and when

     we had finished our visit we variegated ourselves with selections

     from Russian costumes and sailed away again more picturesque than

     ever.  In Smyrna we picked up camel's hair shawls and other dressy

     things from Persia; but in Palestine--ah, in Palestine--our splendid

     career ended.  They didn't wear any clothes there to speak of.  We

     were satisfied, and stopped.  We made no experiments.  We did not

     try their costume.  But we astonished the natives of that country.

     We astonished them with such eccentricities of dress as we could

     muster.  We prowled through the Holy Land, from Cesarea Philippi to

     Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, a weird procession of pilgrims, gotten

     up regardless of expense, solemn, gorgeous, green-spectacled,

     drowsing under blue umbrellas, and astride of a sorrier lot of

     horses, camels and asses than those that came out of Noah's ark,

     after eleven months of seasickness and short rations.  If ever those

     children of Israel in Palestine forget when Gideon's Band went

     through there from America, they ought to be cursed once more and

     finished.  It was the rarest spectacle that ever astounded mortal

     eyes, perhaps.



     Well, we were at home in Palestine.  It was easy to see that that

     was the grand feature of the expedition.  We had cared nothing much

     about Europe.  We galloped through the Louvre, the Pitti, the

     Ufizzi, the Vatican--all the galleries--and through the pictured and

     frescoed churches of Venice, Naples, and the cathedrals of Spain;

     some of us said that certain of the great works of the old masters

     were glorious creations of genius, (we found it out in the guide-

     book, though we got hold of the wrong picture sometimes,) and the

     others said they were disgraceful old daubs.  We examined modern and

     ancient statuary with a critical eye in Florence, Rome, or any where

     we found it, and praised it if we saw fit, and if we didn't we said

     we preferred the wooden Indians in front of the cigar stores of

     America.  But the Holy Land brought out all our enthusiasm.  We fell

     into raptures by the barren shores of Galilee; we pondered at Tabor

     and at Nazareth; we exploded into poetry over the questionable

     loveliness of Esdraelon; we meditated at Jezreel and Samaria over

     the missionary zeal of Jehu; we rioted--fairly rioted among the holy

     places of Jerusalem; we bathed in Jordan and the Dead Sea, reckless

     whether our accident-insurance policies were extra-hazardous or not,

     and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places

     that all the country from Jericho to the mountains of Moab will

     suffer from drouth this year, I think.  Yet, the pilgrimage part of

     the excursion was its pet feature--there is no question about that.

     After dismal, smileless Palestine, beautiful Egypt had few charms

     for us.  We merely glanced at it and were ready for home.



     They wouldn't let us land at Malta--quarantine; they would not let

     us land in Sardinia; nor at Algiers, Africa; nor at Malaga, Spain,

     nor Cadiz, nor at the Madeira islands.  So we got offended at all

     foreigners and turned our backs upon them and came home.  I suppose

     we only stopped at the Bermudas because they were in the programme.

     We did not care any thing about any place at all.  We wanted to go

     home.  Homesickness was abroad in the ship--it was epidemic.  If the

     authorities of New York had known how badly we had it, they would

     have quarantined us here.



     The grand pilgrimage is over.  Good-bye to it, and a pleasant memory

     to it, I am able to say in all kindness.  I bear no malice, no ill-

     will toward any individual that was connected with it, either as

     passenger or officer.  Things I did not like at all yesterday I like

     very well to-day, now that I am at home, and always hereafter I

     shall be able to poke fun at the whole gang if the spirit so moves

     me to do, without ever saying a malicious word.  The expedition

     accomplished all that its programme promised that it should

     accomplish, and we ought all to be satisfied with the management of

     the matter, certainly.  Bye-bye!



                                             MARK TWAIN.





I call that complimentary.  It is complimentary; and yet I never have

received a word of thanks for it from the Hadjis; on the contrary I speak

nothing but the serious truth when I say that many of them even took

exceptions to the article.  In endeavoring to please them I slaved over

that sketch for two hours, and had my labor for my pains.  I never will

do a generous deed again.









CONCLUSION.



Nearly one year has flown since this notable pilgrimage was ended; and as

I sit here at home in San Francisco thinking, I am moved to confess that

day by day the mass of my memories of the excursion have grown more and

more pleasant as the disagreeable incidents of travel which encumbered

them flitted one by one out of my mind--and now, if the Quaker City were

weighing her anchor to sail away on the very same cruise again, nothing

could gratify me more than to be a passenger.  With the same captain and

even the same pilgrims, the same sinners.  I was on excellent terms with

eight or nine of the excursionists (they are my staunch friends yet,) and

was even on speaking terms with the rest of the sixty-five.  I have been

at sea quite enough to know that that was a very good average.  Because a

long sea-voyage not only brings out all the mean traits one has, and

exaggerates them, but raises up others which he never suspected he

possessed, and even creates new ones.  A twelve months' voyage at sea

would make of an ordinary man a very miracle of meanness.  On the other

hand, if a man has good qualities, the spirit seldom moves him to exhibit

them on shipboard, at least with any sort of emphasis.  Now I am

satisfied that our pilgrims are pleasant old people on shore; I am also

satisfied that at sea on a second voyage they would be pleasanter,

somewhat, than they were on our grand excursion, and so I say without

hesitation that I would be glad enough to sail with them again.  I could

at least enjoy life with my handful of old friends.  They could enjoy

life with their cliques as well--passengers invariably divide up into

cliques, on all ships.



And I will say, here, that I would rather travel with an excursion party

of Methuselahs than have to be changing ships and comrades constantly, as

people do who travel in the ordinary way.  Those latter are always

grieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over other

comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them.  They learn to

love a ship just in time to change it for another, and they become

attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him.  They have

that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strange

people who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customary

bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants,

repeated over and over again within the compass of every month.  They

have also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of running

the distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendant

upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety.

I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so.

We never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, and

when we returned to it.  Whenever we made a land journey, we estimated

how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should

need, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or two

accordingly, and left the trunks on board.  We chose our comrades from

among our old, tried friends, and started.  We were never dependent upon

strangers for companionship.  We often had occasion to pity Americans

whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to

exchange pains and pleasures with.  Whenever we were coming back from a

land journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship--

and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak, we felt as a

returning wanderer feels when he sees his home.  When we stepped on

board, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship was

home to us.  We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, and

feel safe and at peace and comfortable again.



I have no fault to find with the manner in which our excursion was

conducted.  Its programme was faithfully carried out--a thing which

surprised me, for great enterprises usually promise vastly more than they

perform.  It would be well if such an excursion could be gotten up every

year and the system regularly inaugurated.  Travel is fatal to prejudice,

bigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on

these accounts.  Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things can

not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's

lifetime.



The Excursion is ended, and has passed to its place among the things that

were.  But its varied scenes and its manifold incidents will linger

pleasantly in our memories for many a year to come.  Always on the wing,

as we were, and merely pausing a moment to catch fitful glimpses of the

wonders of half a world, we could not hope to receive or retain vivid

impressions of all it was our fortune to see.  Yet our holyday flight has

not been in vain--for above the confusion of vague recollections, certain

of its best prized pictures lift themselves and will still continue

perfect in tint and outline after their surroundings shall have faded

away.



We shall remember something of pleasant France; and something also of

Paris, though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor, and was gone again,

we hardly knew how or where.  We shall remember, always, how we saw

majestic Gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a Spanish sunset

and swimming in a sea of rainbows.  In fancy we shall see Milan again,

and her stately Cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires.

And Padua--Verona--Como, jeweled with stars; and patrician Venice, afloat

on her stagnant flood--silent, desolate, haughty--scornful of her humbled

state--wrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets, of battle and

triumph, and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed.



We can not forget Florence--Naples--nor the foretaste of heaven that is

in the delicious atmosphere of Greece--and surely not Athens and the

broken temples of the Acropolis.  Surely not venerable Rome--nor the

green plain that compasses her round about, contrasting its brightness

with her gray decay--nor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plain

and clothe their looped and windowed raggedness with vines.  We shall

remember St. Peter's: not as one sees it when he walks the streets of

Rome and fancies all her domes are just alike, but as he sees it leagues

away, when every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one dome

looms superbly up in the flush of sunset, full of dignity and grace,

strongly outlined as a mountain.



We shall remember Constantinople and the Bosporus--the colossal

magnificence of Baalbec--the Pyramids of Egypt--the prodigious form, the

benignant countenance of the Sphynx--Oriental Smyrna--sacred Jerusalem--

Damascus, the "Pearl of the East," the pride of Syria, the fabled Garden

of Eden, the home of princes and genii of the Arabian Nights, the oldest

metropolis on earth, the one city in all the world that has kept its name

and held its place and looked serenely on while the Kingdoms and Empires

of four thousand years have risen to life, enjoyed their little season of

pride and pomp, and then vanished and been forgotten!

        MARK TWAIN'S (BURLESQUE) AUTO-BIOGRAPHY

        FIRST ROMANCE.



1871









BURLESQUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY.



Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would

write an autobiography they would read it, when they got leisure, I yield

at last to this frenzied public demand, and herewith tender my history:



Ours is a noble old house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity.

The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the

family by the name of Higgins.  This was in the eleventh century, when

our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England.  Why it is

that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when

one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert

foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever

felt much desire to stir.  It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we

leave it alone.  All the old families do that way.



Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note a solicitor on the highway

in William Rufus' time.  At about the age of thirty he went to one of

those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about

something, and never returned again.  While there he died suddenly.



Augustus Twain, seems to have made something of a stir about -the year

1160.  He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old

sabre and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night,

and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump.  He was a

born humorist.  But he got to going too far with it; and the first time

he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one

end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it

could contemplate the people and have a good time.  He never liked any

situation so much or stuck to it so long.



Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of

soldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle

singing; right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right

ahead of it.



This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that our

family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out at

right angles, and bore fruit winter, and summer.

                         OUR FAMILY TREE



Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called "the Scholar."

He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand.  And he could imitate anybody's

hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to

see it.  He had infinite sport with his talent.  But by and by he took a

contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled

his hand.  Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone

business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years.

In fact, he died in harness.  During all those long years he gave such

satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till

government gave him another.  He was a perfect pet.  And he was always a

favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their

benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang.  He always wore his

hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by

the government.  He was a sore loss to his country.  For he was so

regular.



Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain.  He came over

to this country with Columbus in 1492, as a passenger.  He appears to

have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition.  He complained of the

food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless

there was a change.  He wanted fresh shad.  Hardly a day passed over his

head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air,

sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew

where he was going to or had ever been there before.  The memorable cry

of "Land ho!" thrilled every heart in the ship but his.  He gazed a while

through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant

water, and then said: "Land be hanged,--it's a raft!"



When this questionable passenger came on board the ship, he brought

nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked

"B. G.," one cotton sock marked "L. W. C." one woollen one marked "D. F."

and a night-shirt marked "O. M. R."  And yet during the voyage he worried

more about his "trunk," and gave himself more airs about it, than all

the rest of the passengers put together.



If the ship was "down by the head," and would got steer, he would go and

move his "trunk" farther aft, and then watch the effect.  If the

ship was "by the stern," he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men

to "shift that baggage."  In storms he had to be gagged, because his

wailings about his "trunk" made it impossible for the men to hear the

orders.  The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any

gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a "curious

circumstance" that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a

newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a

couple of champagne baskets.  But when he came back insinuating in an

insolent, swaggering way, that some of his things were missing, and was

going to search the other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and they

threw him overboard.  They watched long and wonderingly for him to come

up, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide.  But while

every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was

momentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that the

vessel was adrift and the anchor cable hanging limp from the bow.  Then

in the ship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:



          "In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde

          gonne downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to

          ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it,

          ye sonne of a ghun!"



Yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride that

we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever

interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians.

He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day he

claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and

elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever,

labored among them.  At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and

chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see

his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, and

while there received injuries which terminated in his death.



The great grandson of the "Reformer" flourished in sixteen hundred and

something, and was known in our annals as, "the old Admiral," though in

history he had other titles.  He was long in command of fleets of swift

vessels, well armed and, manned, and did great service in hurrying up

merchantmen.  Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always

made good fair time across the ocean.  But if a ship still loitered in

spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could

contain himself no longer--and then he would take that ship home where he

lived and, keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it,

but they never did.  And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out

of the sailors of that ship by compelling, them to take invigorating

exercise and a bath.  He called it "walking a plank."  All the pupils

liked it.  At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying

it.  When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always

burned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost.  At last

this fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors.

And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had

been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated.



Charles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth

century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary.  He converted

sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth

necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to

divine service in.  His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when

his funeral was over, they got up in a body (and came out of the

restaurant) with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that he

was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him.



PAH-GO-TO-WAH-WAH-PUKKETEKEEWIS (Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye) TWAIN

adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided Gen. Braddock

with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington.  It was this

ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree.

So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is

correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth

round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being

reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not

lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously

impairs the integrity of history.  What he did say was:



"It ain't no (hic !) no use.  'At man's so drunk he can't stan' still

long enough for a man to hit him.  I (hic !) I can't 'ford to fool away

any more am'nition on him!"



That was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was, a good

plain matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to

us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.



I always enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving

that every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of

times (two easily grows to seventeen in a century), and missed him,

jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier

for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why

Washington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in his

the prophecy' came true, and in that of the others it didn't.  There are

not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians

and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in his

overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been

fulfilled.



I will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so

thoroughly well known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt

it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the

order of their birth.  Among these may be mentioned RICHARD BRINSLEY

TWAIN, alias Guy Fawkes; JOHN WENTWORTH TWAIN, alias Sixteen-String Jack;

WILLIAM HOGARTH TWAIN, alias Jack Sheppard; ANANIAS TWAIN, alias Baron

Munchausen; JOHN GEORGE TWAIN, alias Capt. Kydd; and them there are

George Francis Train, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar and Baalam's Ass--they

all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distantly

removed from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral branch,

whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order to

acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they have

got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.



It is not well; when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry

down too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely of

your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I now

do.



I was born without teeth--and there Richard III had the advantage of me;

but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the

advantage of him.  My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously

honest.



But now a thought occurs to me.  My own history would really seem so tame

contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave

it unwritten until I am hanged.  If some other biographies I have read

had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have

been a felicitous thing, for the reading public.  How does it strike you?















                            AWFUL, TERRIBLE

                            MEDIEVAL ROMANCE



CHAPTER I



THE SECRET REVEALED.



It was night.  Stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of

Klugenstein.  The year 1222 was drawing to a close.  Far away up in the

tallest of the castle's towers a single light glimmered.  A secret

council was being held there.  The stern old lord of Klugenstein sat in

a chair of state meditating.  Presently he, said, with a tender

accent:



"My daughter!"



A young man of noble presence, clad from head to heel in knightly mail,

answered:



"Speak, father!"



"My daughter, the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hath

puzzled all your young life.  Know, then, that it had its birth in the

matters which I shall now unfold.  My brother Ulrich is the great Duke of

Brandenburgh.  Our father, on his deathbed, decreed that if no son were

born to Ulrich, the succession should pass to my house, provided a son

were born to me.  And further, in case no son, were born to either, but

only daughters, then the succession should pass to Ulrich's daughter,

if she proved stainless; if she did not, my daughter should succeed,

if she retained a blameless name.  And so I, and my old wife here, prayed

fervently for the good boon of a son, but the prayer was vain.  You were

born to us.  I was in despair.  I saw the mighty prize slipping from my

grasp, the splendid dream vanishing away.  And I had been so hopeful!

Five years had Ulrich lived in wedlock, and yet his wife had borne no

heir of either sex.



"'But hold,' I said, 'all is not lost.'  A saving scheme had shot athwart

my brain.  You were born at midnight.  Only the leech, the nurse, and six

waiting-women knew your sex.  I hanged them every one before an hour had

sped.  Next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over the

proclamation that a son was born to Klugenstein, an heir to mighty

Brandenburgh!  And well the secret has been kept.  Your mother's own

sister nursed your infancy, and from that time forward we feared nothing.



"When you were ten years old, a daughter was born to Ulrich.  We grieved,

but hoped for good results from measles, or physicians, or other natural

enemies of infancy, but were always disappointed.  She lived, she throve-

-Heaven's malison upon her!  But it is nothing.  We are safe.  For,

Ha-ha! have we not a son?  And is not our son the future Duke?  Our well-

beloved Conrad, is it not so?--for, woman of eight-and-twenty years--as

you are, my child, none other name than that hath ever fallen to you!



"Now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother,

and he waxes feeble.  The cares of state do tax him sore.  Therefore he

wills that you shall come to him and be already Duke--in act, though not

yet in name.  Your servitors are ready--you journey forth to-night.



"Now listen well.  Remember every word I say.  There is a law as old as

Germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal

chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people,

SHE SHALL DIE! So heed my words.  Pretend humility.  Pronounce your

judgments from the Premier's chair, which stands at the foot of the

throne.  Do this until you are crowned and safe.  It is not likely that

your sex will ever be discovered; but still it is the part of wisdom to

make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life."



"Oh; my father, is it for this my life hath been a lie!  Was it that I

might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights?  Spare me, father,

spare your child!"



"What, huzzy!  Is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has

wrought for thee?  By the bones of my father, this puling sentiment of

thine but ill accords with my humor.



"Betake thee to the Duke, instantly!  And beware how thou meddlest with my

purpose!"



Let this suffice, of the conversation.  It is enough for us to know that

the prayers, the entreaties and the tears of the gentle-natured girl

availed nothing.  They nor anything could move the stout old lord of

Klugenstein.  And so, at last, with a heavy heart, the daughter saw the

castle gates close behind her, and found herself riding away in the

darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed, vassals and a brave

following of servants.



The old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughter's departure,

and then he turned to his sad wife and said:



"Dame, our matters seem speeding fairly.  It is full three months since I

sent the shrewd and handsome Count Detzin on his devilish mission to my

brother's daughter Constance.  If he fail, we are not wholly safe; but if

he do succeed, no power can bar our girl from being Duchess e'en though

ill-fortune should decree she never should be Duke!"



"My heart is full of bodings, yet all may still be well."



"Tush, woman! Leave the owls to croak.  To bed with ye, and dream of

Brandenburgh and grandeur!"









CHAPTER II.



FESTIVITY AND TEARS



Six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter, the

brilliant capital of the Duchy of Brandenburgh was resplendent with

military pageantry, and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes;

for Conrad, the young heir to the crown, was come.  The old Duke's, heart

was full of happiness, for Conrad's handsome person and graceful bearing

had won his love at once.  The great halls of tie palace were thronged

with nobles, who welcomed Conrad bravely; and so bright and happy did all

things seem, that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and giving

place to a comforting contentment.



But in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature

was, transpiring.  By a window stood the Duke's only child, the Lady

Constance.  Her eyes were red and swollen, and full of tears.  She was

alone.  Presently she fell to weeping anew, and said aloud:



"The villain Detzin is gone--has fled the dukedom!  I could not believe

it at first, but alas! it is too true.  And I loved him so.  I dared to

love him though I knew the Duke my father would never let me wed him.

I loved him--but now I hate him!  With all, my soul I hate him!  Oh, what

is to become of me!  I am lost, lost, lost!  I shall go mad!"









CHAPTER III.



THE PLOT THICKENS.



Few months drifted by.  All men published the praises of the young

Conrad's government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments, the

mercifulness of his sentences, and the modesty with which he bore himself

in his great office.  The old Duke soon gave everything into his hands,

and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir

delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier.

It seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men

as Conrad was, could not be otherwise than happy.  But strange enough,

he was not.  For he saw with dismay that the Princess Constance had begun

to love him!  The love of, the rest of the world was happy fortune for

him, but this was freighted with danger!  And he saw, moreover, that the

delighted Duke had discovered his daughter's passion likewise, and was

already dreaming of a marriage.  Every day somewhat of the deep sadness

that had been in the princess' face faded away; every day hope and

animation beamed brighter from her eye; and by and by even vagrant smiles

visited the face that had been so troubled.



Conrad was appalled.  He bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to

the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own

sex when he was new and a stranger in the palace--when he was sorrowful

and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel.  He now

began to avoid, his cousin.  But this only made matters worse, for,

naturally enough, the more he avoided her, the more she cast herself in

his way.  He marveled at this at first; and next it startled him.  The

girl haunted him; she hunted him; she happened upon him at all times and

in all places, in the night as well as in the day.  She seemed singularly

anxious.  There was surely a mystery somewhere.



This could not go on forever.  All the world was talking about it.  The

Duke was beginning to look perplexed.  Poor Conrad was becoming a very

ghost through dread and dire distress.  One day as he was emerging from a

private ante-room attached to the picture gallery, Constance confronted

him, and seizing both his hands, in hers, exclaimed:



"Oh, why, do you avoid me?  What have I done--what have I said, to lose

your kind opinion of me--for, surely I had it once?  Conrad, do not

despise me, but pity a tortured heart?  I cannot--cannot hold the words

unspoken longer, lest they kill me--I LOVE you, CONRAD!  There, despise

me if you must, but they would be uttered!"



Conrad was speechless.  Constance hesitated a moment, and then,

misinterpreting his silence, a wild gladness flamed in her eyes, and she

flung her arms about his neck and said:



"You relent! you relent! You can love me--you will love me! Oh, say you

will, my own, my worshipped Conrad!'"



Conrad groaned aloud.  A sickly pallor overspread his countenance, and

he trembled like an aspen.  Presently, in desperation, he thrust the poor

girl from him, and cried:



"You know not what you ask!  It is forever and ever impossible!"  And then

he fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with amazement.

A minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there, and Conrad was

crying and sobbing in his chamber.  Both were in despair.  Both save ruin

staring them in the face.



By and by Constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away, saying:



"To think that he was despising my love at the very moment that I thought

it was melting his cruel heart!  I hate him!  He spurned me--did this

man--he spurned me from him like a dog!"









CHAPTER IV



THE AWFUL REVELATION.



Time passed on.  A settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance

of the good Duke's daughter.  She and Conrad were seen together no more

now.  The Duke grieved at this.  But as the weeks wore away, Conrad's

color came back to his cheeks and his old-time vivacity to his eye, and

he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom.



Presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace.  It grew

louder; it spread farther.  The gossips of the city got hold-of it.  It

swept the dukedom.  And this is what the whisper said:



"The Lady Constance hath given birth to a child!"



When the lord of Klugenstein heard it, he swung his plumed helmet thrice

around his head and shouted:



"Long live.  Duke Conrad!--for lo, his crown is sure, from this day

forward!  Detzin has done his errand well, and the good scoundrel shall

be rewarded!"



And he spread, the tidings far and wide, and for eight-and-forty hours no

soul in all the barony but did dance and sing, carouse and illuminate, to

celebrate the great event, and all at proud and happy old Klugenstein's

expense.









CHAPTER V.



THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.



The trial was at hand.  All the great lords and barons of Brandenburgh

were assembled in the Hall of Justice in the ducal palace.  No space was

left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit.

Conrad, clad in purple and ermine, sat in the premier's chair, and on

either side sat the great judges of the realm.  The old Duke had sternly

commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed, without favor,

and then had taken to his bed broken-hearted.  His days were numbered.

Poor Conrad had begged, as for his very life, that he might be spared the

misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin's crime, but it did not

avail.



The saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in Conrad's breast.



The gladdest was in his father's.  For, unknown to his daughter "Conrad,"

the old Baron Klugenstein was come, and was among the crowd of nobles,

triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house.



After the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries

had followed, the venerable Lord Chief justice said:



"Prisoner, stand forth!"



The unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast multitude.

The Lord Chief Justice continued:



"Most noble lady, before the great judges of this realm it hath been

charged and proven that out of holy wedlock your Grace hath given birth

unto a child; and by our ancient law the penalty is death, excepting in

one sole contingency, whereof his Grace the acting Duke, our good Lord

Conrad, will advertise you in his solemn sentence now; wherefore, give

heed."



Conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre, and in the self-same moment

the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the doomed

prisoner, and the tears came into his eyes.  He opened his lips to speak,

but the Lord Chief Justice said quickly:



"Not there, your Grace, not there!  It is not lawful to pronounce

judgment upon any of the ducal line SAVE FROM THE DUCAL THRONE!"



A shudder went to the heart of poor Conrad, and a tremor shook the iron

frame of his old father likewise.  CONRAD HAD NOT BEEN CROWNED--dared he

profane the throne? He hesitated and turned pale with fear.  But it must

be done.  Wondering eyes were already upon him.  They would be suspicious

eyes if he hesitated longer.  He ascended the throne.  Presently he

stretched forth the sceptre again, and said:



"Prisoner, in the name of our sovereign lord, Ulrich, Duke of

Brandenburgh, I proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me.

Give heed to my words.  By the ancient law of the land, except you

produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner,

you must surely die.  Embrace this opportunity--save yourself while yet

you may.  Name the father of your child!"



A solemn hush fell upon the great court--a silence so profound that men

could hear their own hearts beat.  Then the princess slowly turned, with

eyes gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight at Conrad,

said:



"Thou art the man!"



An appalling conviction of his helpless, hopeless peril struck a chill to

Conrad's heart like the chill of death itself.  What power on earth could

save him!  To disprove the charge, he must reveal that he was a woman;

and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death!  At one

and the same moment, he and his grim old father swooned and fell to, the

ground.



[The remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will NOT be found in

this or any other publication, either now or at any future time.]



The truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a particularly

close place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get him (or her)

out of it again--and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole

business, and leave that person to get out the best way that offers--or

else stay there.  I thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten

out that little difficulty, but it looks different now.

                                   TO

                           CALVIN H. HIGBIE,

                             Of California,

                         THIS BOOK IS INSCRIBED

                             By the Author,

                     In Memory of the Curious Time

                              When We Two

                    WERE MILLIONAIRES FOR TEN DAYS.









                              ROUGHING IT



                                   BY

                              MARK TWAIN.

                          (SAMUEL L. CLEMENS.)







                               PREFATORY.



This book is merely a personal narrative, and not a pretentious history

or a philosophical dissertation. It is a record of several years of

variegated vagabondizing, and its object is rather to help the resting

reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics, or goad

him with science. Still, there is information in the volume; information

concerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far West, about

which no books have been written by persons who were on the ground in

person, and saw the happenings of the time with their own eyes. I allude

to the rise, growth and culmination of the silver-mining fever in Nevada

-a curious episode, in some respects; the only one, of its peculiar kind,

that has occurred in the land; and the only one, indeed, that is likely

to occur in it.



Yes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of information in the

book. I regret this very much; but really it could not be helped:

information appears to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar

of roses out of the otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would

give worlds if I could retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I calk

up the sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom. Therefore,

I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader, not

justification.

CHAPTER I.



My brother had just been appointed Secretary of Nevada Territory--an

office of such majesty that it concentrated in itself the duties and

dignities of Treasurer, Comptroller, Secretary of State, and Acting

Governor in the Governor's absence.  A salary of eighteen hundred dollars

a year and the title of "Mr. Secretary," gave to the great position an

air of wild and imposing grandeur.  I was young and ignorant, and I

envied my brother.  I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor,

but particularly and especially the long, strange journey he was going to

make, and the curious new world he was going to explore.  He was going to

travel!  I never had been away from home, and that word "travel" had a

seductive charm for me.  Pretty soon he would be hundreds and hundreds of

miles away on the great plains and deserts, and among the mountains of

the Far West, and would see buffaloes and Indians, and prairie dogs, and

antelopes, and have all kinds of adventures, and may be get hanged or

scalped, and have ever such a fine time, and write home and tell us all

about it, and be a hero.  And he would see the gold mines and the silver

mines, and maybe go about of an afternoon when his work was done, and

pick up two or three pailfuls of shining slugs, and nuggets of gold and

silver on the hillside.  And by and by he would become very rich, and

return home by sea, and be able to talk as calmly about San Francisco and

the ocean, and "the isthmus" as if it was nothing of any consequence to

have seen those marvels face to face.  What I suffered in contemplating

his happiness, pen cannot describe.  And so, when he offered me, in cold

blood, the sublime position of private secretary under him, it appeared

to me that the heavens and the earth passed away, and the firmament was

rolled together as a scroll!  I had nothing more to desire.  My

contentment was complete.



At the end of an hour or two I was ready for the journey.  Not much

packing up was necessary, because we were going in the overland stage

from the Missouri frontier to Nevada, and passengers were only allowed a

small quantity of baggage apiece.  There was no Pacific railroad in those

fine times of ten or twelve years ago--not a single rail of it.

I only proposed to stay in Nevada three months--I had no thought of

staying longer than that.  I meant to see all I could that was new and

strange, and then hurry home to business.  I little thought that I would

not see the end of that three-month pleasure excursion for six or seven

uncommonly long years!



I dreamed all night about Indians, deserts, and silver bars, and in due

time, next day, we took shipping at the St. Louis wharf on board a

steamboat bound up the Missouri River.



We were six days going from St. Louis to "St. Jo."--a trip that was so

dull, and sleepy, and eventless that it has left no more impression on my

memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many

days.  No record is left in my mind, now, concerning it, but a confused

jumble of savage-looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with

one wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted, and then

retired from and climbed over in some softer place; and of sand-bars

which we roosted on occasionally, and rested, and then got out our

crutches and sparred over.



In fact, the boat might almost as well have gone to St. Jo. by land, for

she was walking most of the time, anyhow--climbing over reefs and

clambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long.  The

captain said she was a "bully" boat, and all she wanted was more "shear"

and a bigger wheel.  I thought she wanted a pair of stilts, but I had the

deep sagacity not to say so.









CHAPTER II.



The first thing we did on that glad evening that landed us at St. Joseph

was to hunt up the stage-office, and pay a hundred and fifty dollars

apiece for tickets per overland coach to Carson City, Nevada.



The next morning, bright and early, we took a hasty breakfast, and

hurried to the starting-place.  Then an inconvenience presented itself

which we had not properly appreciated before, namely, that one cannot

make a heavy traveling trunk stand for twenty-five pounds of baggage--

because it weighs a good deal more.  But that was all we could take--

twenty-five pounds each.  So we had to snatch our trunks open, and make a

selection in a good deal of a hurry.  We put our lawful twenty-five

pounds apiece all in one valise, and shipped the trunks back to St. Louis

again.  It was a sad parting, for now we had no swallow-tail coats and

white kid gloves to wear at Pawnee receptions in the Rocky Mountains, and

no stove-pipe hats nor patent-leather boots, nor anything else necessary

to make life calm and peaceful.  We were reduced to a war-footing.  Each

of us put on a rough, heavy suit of clothing, woolen army shirt and

"stogy" boots included; and into the valise we crowded a few white

shirts, some under-clothing and such things.  My brother, the Secretary,

took along about four pounds of United States statutes and six pounds of

Unabridged Dictionary; for we did not know--poor innocents--that such

things could be bought in San Francisco on one day and received in Carson

City the next.  I was armed to the teeth with a pitiful little Smith &

Wesson's seven-shooter, which carried a ball like a homoeopathic pill,

and it took the whole seven to make a dose for an adult.  But I thought

it was grand.  It appeared to me to be a dangerous weapon.  It only had

one fault--you could not hit anything with it.  One of our "conductors"

practiced awhile on a cow with it, and as long as she stood still and

behaved herself she was safe; but as soon as she went to moving about,

and he got to shooting at other things, she came to grief.  The Secretary

had a small-sized Colt's revolver strapped around him for protection

against the Indians, and to guard against accidents he carried it

uncapped.  Mr. George Bemis was dismally formidable.  George Bemis was

our fellow-traveler.



We had never seen him before.  He wore in his belt an old original

"Allen" revolver, such as irreverent people called a "pepper-box." Simply

drawing the trigger back, cocked and fired the pistol.  As the trigger

came back, the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn over,

and presently down would drop the hammer, and away would speed the ball.

To aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a feat

which was probably never done with an "Allen" in the world.  But George's

was a reliable weapon, nevertheless, because, as one of the stage-drivers

afterward said, "If she didn't get what she went after, she would fetch

something else." And so she did.  She went after a deuce of spades nailed

against a tree, once, and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards to

the left of it.  Bemis did not want the mule; but the owner came out with

a double-barreled shotgun and persuaded him to buy it, anyhow.  It was a

cheerful weapon--the "Allen." Sometimes all its six barrels would go off

at once, and then there was no safe place in all the region round about,

but behind it.



We took two or three blankets for protection against frosty weather in

the mountains.  In the matter of luxuries we were modest--we took none

along but some pipes and five pounds of smoking tobacco.  We had two

large canteens to carry water in, between stations on the Plains, and we

also took with us a little shot-bag of silver coin for daily expenses in

the way of breakfasts and dinners.



By eight o'clock everything was ready, and we were on the other side of

the river.  We jumped into the stage, the driver cracked his whip, and we

bowled away and left "the States" behind us.  It was a superb summer

morning, and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine.  There was a

freshness and breeziness, too, and an exhilarating sense of emancipation

from all sorts of cares and responsibilities, that almost made us feel

that the years we had spent in the close, hot city, toiling and slaving,

had been wasted and thrown away.  We were spinning along through Kansas,

and in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on the

great Plains.  Just here the land was rolling--a grand sweep of regular

elevations and depressions as far as the eye could reach--like the

stately heave and swell of the ocean's bosom after a storm.  And

everywhere were cornfields, accenting with squares of deeper green, this

limitless expanse of grassy land.  But presently this sea upon dry ground

was to lose its "rolling" character and stretch away for seven hundred

miles as level as a floor!



Our coach was a great swinging and swaying stage, of the most sumptuous

description--an imposing cradle on wheels.  It was drawn by six handsome

horses, and by the side of the driver sat the "conductor," the legitimate

captain of the craft; for it was his business to take charge and care of

the mails, baggage, express matter, and passengers.  We three were the

only passengers, this trip.  We sat on the back seat, inside.  About all

the rest of the coach was full of mail bags--for we had three days'

delayed mails with us.  Almost touching our knees, a perpendicular wall

of mail matter rose up to the roof.  There was a great pile of it

strapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were full.

We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver said--"a

little for Brigham, and Carson, and 'Frisco, but the heft of it for the

Injuns, which is powerful troublesome 'thout they get plenty of truck to

read." But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenance

which was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake, we

guessed that his remark was intended to be facetious, and to mean that we

would unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the Plains and

leave it to the Indians, or whosoever wanted it.



We changed horses every ten miles, all day long, and fairly flew over the

hard, level road.  We jumped out and stretched our legs every time the

coach stopped, and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatigued.



After supper a woman got in, who lived about fifty miles further on, and

we three had to take turns at sitting outside with the driver and

conductor.  Apparently she was not a talkative woman.  She would sit

there in the gathering twilight and fasten her steadfast eyes on a

mosquito rooting into her arm, and slowly she would raise her other hand

till she had got his range, and then she would launch a slap at him that

would have jolted a cow; and after that she would sit and contemplate the

corpse with tranquil satisfaction--for she never missed her mosquito; she

was a dead shot at short range.  She never removed a carcase, but left

them there for bait.  I sat by this grim Sphynx and watched her kill

thirty or forty mosquitoes--watched her, and waited for her to say

something, but she never did.  So I finally opened the conversation

myself.  I said:



"The mosquitoes are pretty bad, about here, madam."



"You bet!"



"What did I understand you to say, madam?"



"You BET!"



Then she cheered up, and faced around and said:



"Danged if I didn't begin to think you fellers was deef and dumb.  I did,

b'gosh.  Here I've sot, and sot, and sot, a-bust'n muskeeters and

wonderin' what was ailin' ye.  Fust I thot you was deef and dumb, then I

thot you was sick or crazy, or suthin', and then by and by I begin to

reckon you was a passel of sickly fools that couldn't think of nothing to

say.  Wher'd ye come from?"



The Sphynx was a Sphynx no more!  The fountains of her great deep were

broken up, and she rained the nine parts of speech forty days and forty

nights, metaphorically speaking, and buried us under a desolating deluge

of trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacle of rejoinder

projecting above the tossing waste of dislocated grammar and decomposed

pronunciation!



How we suffered, suffered, suffered!  She went on, hour after hour, till

I was sorry I ever opened the mosquito question and gave her a start.

She never did stop again until she got to her journey's end toward

daylight; and then she stirred us up as she was leaving the stage (for we

were nodding, by that time), and said:



"Now you git out at Cottonwood, you fellers, and lay over a couple o'

days, and I'll be along some time to-night, and if I can do ye any good

by edgin' in a word now and then, I'm right thar.  Folks'll tell you't

I've always ben kind o' offish and partic'lar for a gal that's raised in

the woods, and I am, with the rag-tag and bob-tail, and a gal has to be,

if she wants to be anything, but when people comes along which is my

equals, I reckon I'm a pretty sociable heifer after all."



We resolved not to "lay by at Cottonwood."









CHAPTER III.



About an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along smoothly

over the road--so smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a gentle,

lulling way, that was gradually soothing us to sleep, and dulling our

consciousness--when something gave away under us!  We were dimly aware of

it, but indifferent to it.  The coach stopped.  We heard the driver and

conductor talking together outside, and rummaging for a lantern, and

swearing because they could not find it--but we had no interest in

whatever had happened, and it only added to our comfort to think of those

people out there at work in the murky night, and we snug in our nest with

the curtains drawn.  But presently, by the sounds, there seemed to be an

examination going on, and then the driver's voice said:



"By George, the thoroughbrace is broke!"



This startled me broad awake--as an undefined sense of calamity is always

apt to do.  I said to myself: "Now, a thoroughbrace is probably part of a

horse; and doubtless a vital part, too, from the dismay in the driver's

voice.  Leg, maybe--and yet how could he break his leg waltzing along

such a road as this?  No, it can't be his leg.  That is impossible,

unless he was reaching for the driver.  Now, what can be the

thoroughbrace of a horse, I wonder?  Well, whatever comes, I shall not

air my ignorance in this crowd, anyway."



Just then the conductor's face appeared at a lifted curtain, and his

lantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter.  He said:

"Gents, you'll have to turn out a spell.  Thoroughbrace is broke."



We climbed out into a chill drizzle, and felt ever so homeless and

dreary.  When I found that the thing they called a "thoroughbrace" was

the massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks itself

in, I said to the driver:



"I never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that, before, that I can

remember.  How did it happen?"



"Why, it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days' mail--

that's how it happened," said he.  "And right here is the very direction

which is wrote on all the newspaper-bags which was to be put out for the

Injuns for to keep 'em quiet.  It's most uncommon lucky, becuz it's so

nation dark I should 'a' gone by unbeknowns if that air thoroughbrace

hadn't broke."



I knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his, though I

could not see his face, because he was bent down at work; and wishing him

a safe delivery, I turned to and helped the rest get out the mail-sacks.

It made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out.  When they

had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again, but put no

mail on top, and only half as much inside as there was before.  The

conductor bent all the seat-backs down, and then filled the coach just

half full of mail-bags from end to end.  We objected loudly to this, for

it left us no seats.  But the conductor was wiser than we, and said a bed

was better than seats, and moreover, this plan would protect his

thoroughbraces.  We never wanted any seats after that.  The lazy bed was

infinitely preferable.  I had many an exciting day, subsequently, lying

on it reading the statutes and the dictionary, and wondering how the

characters would turn out.



The conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station to

take charge of the abandoned mail-bags, and we drove on.



It was now just dawn; and as we stretched our cramped legs full length on

the mail sacks, and gazed out through the windows across the wide wastes

of greensward clad in cool, powdery mist, to where there was an expectant

look in the eastern horizon, our perfect enjoyment took the form of a

tranquil and contented ecstasy.  The stage whirled along at a spanking

gait, the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a most

exhilarating way; the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously, the pattering

of the horses' hoofs, the cracking of the driver's whip, and his "Hi-yi!

g'lang!" were music; the spinning ground and the waltzing trees appeared

to give us a mute hurrah as we went by, and then slack up and look after

us with interest, or envy, or something; and as we lay and smoked the

pipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years of tiresome

city life that had gone before it, we felt that there was only one

complete and satisfying happiness in the world, and we had found it.



After breakfast, at some station whose name I have forgotten, we three

climbed up on the seat behind the driver, and let the conductor have our

bed for a nap.  And by and by, when the sun made me drowsy, I lay down on

my face on top of the coach, grasping the slender iron railing, and slept

for an hour or more.  That will give one an appreciable idea of those

matchless roads.  Instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast hold of

the railing when the stage jolts, but when it only swings and sways, no

grip is necessary.  Overland drivers and conductors used to sit in their

places and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time, on good roads, while

spinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour.  I saw them do

it, often.  There was no danger about it; a sleeping man will seize the

irons in time when the coach jolts.  These men were hard worked, and it

was not possible for them to stay awake all the time.



By and by we passed through Marysville, and over the Big Blue and Little

Sandy; thence about a mile, and entered Nebraska.  About a mile further

on, we came to the Big Sandy--one hundred and eighty miles from St.

Joseph.



As the sun was going down, we saw the first specimen of an animal known

familiarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desert--from Kansas

clear to the Pacific Ocean--as the "jackass rabbit." He is well named.

He is just like any other rabbit, except that he is from one third to

twice as large, has longer legs in proportion to his size, and has the

most preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature but a

jackass.



When he is sitting quiet, thinking about his sins, or is absent-minded or

unapprehensive of danger, his majestic ears project above him

conspicuously; but the breaking of a twig will scare him nearly to death,

and then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for home.  All you can

see, then, for the next minute, is his long gray form stretched out

straight and "streaking it" through the low sage-brush, head erect, eyes

right, and ears just canted a little to the rear, but showing you where

the animal is, all the time, the same as if he carried a jib.  Now and

then he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs, high over the

stunted sage-brush, and scores a leap that would make a horse envious.

Presently he comes down to a long, graceful "lope," and shortly he

mysteriously disappears.  He has crouched behind a sage-bush, and will

sit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of him,

when he will get under way again.  But one must shoot at this creature

once, if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels, and do the

best he knows how.  He is frightened clear through, now, and he lays his

long ears down on his back, straightens himself out like a yard-stick

every spring he makes, and scatters miles behind him with an easy

indifference that is enchanting.



Our party made this specimen "hump himself," as the conductor said.  The

secretary started him with a shot from the Colt; I commenced spitting at

him with my weapon; and all in the same instant the old "Allen's" whole

broadside let go with a rattling crash, and it is not putting it too

strong to say that the rabbit was frantic!  He dropped his ears, set up

his tail, and left for San Francisco at a speed which can only be

described as a flash and a vanish!  Long after he was out of sight we

could hear him whiz.



I do not remember where we first came across "sage-brush," but as I have

been speaking of it I may as well describe it.



This is easily done, for if the reader can imagine a gnarled and

venerable live oak-tree reduced to a little shrub two feet-high, with its

rough bark, its foliage, its twisted boughs, all complete, he can picture

the "sage-brush" exactly.  Often, on lazy afternoons in the mountains, I

have lain on the ground with my face under a sage-bush, and entertained

myself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were liliputian

birds, and that the ants marching and countermarching about its base were

liliputian flocks and herds, and myself some vast loafer from Brobdignag

waiting to catch a little citizen and eat him.



It is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature, is the

"sage-brush."  Its foliage is a grayish green, and gives that tint to

desert and mountain.  It smells like our domestic sage, and "sage-tea"

made from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well

acquainted with.  The sage-brush is a singularly hardy plant, and grows

right in the midst of deep sand, and among barren rocks, where nothing

else in the vegetable world would try to grow, except "bunch-grass."

--["Bunch-grass" grows on the bleak mountain-sides of Nevada and

neighboring territories, and offers excellent feed for stock, even in the

dead of winter, wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it;

notwithstanding its unpromising home, bunch-grass is a better and more

nutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass

that is known--so stock-men say.]--The sage-bushes grow from three to

six or seven feet apart, all over the mountains and deserts of the Far

West, clear to the borders of California.  There is not a tree of any

kind in the deserts, for hundreds of miles--there is no vegetation at all

in a regular desert, except the sage-brush and its cousin the

"greasewood," which is so much like the sage-brush that the difference

amounts to little.  Camp-fires and hot suppers in the deserts would be

impossible but for the friendly sage-brush.  Its trunk is as large as a

boy's wrist (and from that up to a man's arm), and its crooked branches

are half as large as its trunk--all good, sound, hard wood, very like

oak.



When a party camps, the first thing to be done is to cut sage-brush; and

in a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use.  A hole a

foot wide, two feet deep, and two feet long, is dug, and sage-brush

chopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with glowing

coals.  Then the cooking begins, and there is no smoke, and consequently

no swearing.  Such a fire will keep all night, with very little

replenishing; and it makes a very sociable camp-fire, and one around

which the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible, instructive, and

profoundly entertaining.



Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished

failure.  Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his

illegitimate child the mule.  But their testimony to its nutritiousness

is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or

brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes

handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for

dinner.  Mules and donkeys and camels have appetites that anything will

relieve temporarily, but nothing satisfy.



In Syria, once, at the head-waters of the Jordan, a camel took charge of

my overcoat while the tents were being pitched, and examined it with a

critical eye, all over, with as much interest as if he had an idea of

getting one made like it; and then, after he was done figuring on it as

an article of apparel, he began to contemplate it as an article of diet.

He put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth,

and chewed and chewed at it, gradually taking it in, and all the while

opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he had

never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life.  Then

he smacked his lips once or twice, and reached after the other sleeve.

Next he tried the velvet collar, and smiled a smile of such contentment

that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing

about an overcoat.  The tails went next, along with some percussion caps

and cough candy, and some fig-paste from Constantinople.  And then my

newspaper correspondence dropped out, and he took a chance in that--

manuscript letters written for the home papers.  But he was treading on

dangerous ground, now.  He began to come across solid wisdom in those

documents that was rather weighty on his stomach; and occasionally he

would take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth; it

was getting to be perilous times with him, but he held his grip with good

courage and hopefully, till at last he began to stumble on statements

that not even a camel could swallow with impunity.  He began to gag and

gasp, and his eyes to stand out, and his forelegs to spread, and in about

a quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenter's work-bench,

and died a death of indescribable agony.  I went and pulled the

manuscript out of his mouth, and found that the sensitive creature had

choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of fact

that I ever laid before a trusting public.



I was about to say, when diverted from my subject, that occasionally one

finds sage-bushes five or six feet high, and with a spread of branch and

foliage in proportion, but two or two and a half feet is the usual

height.









CHAPTER IV.



As the sun went down and the evening chill came on, we made preparation

for bed.  We stirred up the hard leather letter-sacks, and the knotty

canvas bags of printed matter (knotty and uneven because of projecting

ends and corners of magazines, boxes and books).  We stirred them up and

redisposed them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possible.

And we did improve it, too, though after all our work it had an upheaved

and billowy look about it, like a little piece of a stormy sea.  Next we

hunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mail-bags where they had

settled, and put them on.  Then we got down our coats, vests, pantaloons

and heavy woolen shirts, from the arm-loops where they had been swinging

all day, and clothed ourselves in them--for, there being no ladies either

at the stations or in the coach, and the weather being hot, we had looked

to our comfort by stripping to our underclothing, at nine o'clock in the

morning.  All things being now ready, we stowed the uneasy Dictionary

where it would lie as quiet as possible, and placed the water-canteens

and pistols where we could find them in the dark.  Then we smoked a final

pipe, and swapped a final yarn; after which, we put the pipes, tobacco

and bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the mail-bags, and then

fastened down the coach curtains all around, and made the place as "dark

as the inside of a cow," as the conductor phrased it in his picturesque

way.  It was certainly as dark as any place could be--nothing was even

dimly visible in it.  And finally, we rolled ourselves up like silk-

worms, each person in his own blanket, and sank peacefully to sleep.



Whenever the stage stopped to change horses, we would wake up, and try to

recollect where we were--and succeed--and in a minute or two the stage

would be off again, and we likewise.  We began to get into country, now,

threaded here and there with little streams.  These had high, steep banks

on each side, and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up the

other, our party inside got mixed somewhat.  First we would all be down

in a pile at the forward end of the stage, nearly in a sitting posture,

and in a second we would shoot to the other end, and stand on our heads.

And we would sprawl and kick, too, and ward off ends and corners of mail-

bags that came lumbering over us and about us; and as the dust rose from

the tumult, we would all sneeze in chorus, and the majority of us would

grumble, and probably say some hasty thing, like: "Take your elbow out of

my ribs!--can't you quit crowding?"



Every time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the other, the

Unabridged Dictionary would come too; and every time it came it damaged

somebody.  One trip it "barked" the Secretary's elbow; the next trip it

hurt me in the stomach, and the third it tilted Bemis's nose up till he

could look down his nostrils--he said.  The pistols and coin soon settled

to the bottom, but the pipes, pipe-stems, tobacco and canteens clattered

and floundered after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on us,

and aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes, and water

down our backs.



Still, all things considered, it was a very comfortable night.  It wore

gradually away, and when at last a cold gray light was visible through

the puckers and chinks in the curtains, we yawned and stretched with

satisfaction, shed our cocoons, and felt that we had slept as much as was

necessary.  By and by, as the sun rose up and warmed the world, we pulled

off our clothes and got ready for breakfast.  We were just pleasantly in

time, for five minutes afterward the driver sent the weird music of his

bugle winding over the grassy solitudes, and presently we detected a low

hut or two in the distance.  Then the rattling of the coach, the clatter

of our six horses' hoofs, and the driver's crisp commands, awoke to a

louder and stronger emphasis, and we went sweeping down on the station at

our smartest speed.  It was fascinating--that old overland stagecoaching.



We jumped out in undress uniform.  The driver tossed his gathered reins

out on the ground, gaped and stretched complacently, drew off his heavy

buckskin gloves with great deliberation and insufferable dignity--taking

not the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquires after his health,

and humbly facetious and flattering accostings, and obsequious tenders of

service, from five or six hairy and half-civilized station-keepers and

hostlers who were nimbly unhitching our steeds and bringing the fresh

team out of the stables--for in the eyes of the stage-driver of that day,

station-keepers and hostlers were a sort of good enough low creatures,

useful in their place, and helping to make up a world, but not the kind

of beings which a person of distinction could afford to concern himself

with; while, on the contrary, in the eyes of the station-keeper and the

hostler, the stage-driver was a hero--a great and shining dignitary, the

world's favorite son, the envy of the people, the observed of the

nations.  When they spoke to him they received his insolent silence

meekly, and as being the natural and proper conduct of so great a man;

when he opened his lips they all hung on his words with admiration (he

never honored a particular individual with a remark, but addressed it

with a broad generality to the horses, the stables, the surrounding

country and the human underlings); when he discharged a facetious

insulting personality at a hostler, that hostler was happy for the day;

when he uttered his one jest--old as the hills, coarse, profane, witless,

and inflicted on the same audience, in the same language, every time his

coach drove up there--the varlets roared, and slapped their thighs, and

swore it was the best thing they'd ever heard in all their lives.  And

how they would fly around when he wanted a basin of water, a gourd of the

same, or a light for his pipe!--but they would instantly insult a

passenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at their hands.

They could do that sort of insolence as well as the driver they copied it

from--for, let it be borne in mind, the overland driver had but little

less contempt for his passengers than he had for his hostlers.



The hostlers and station-keepers treated the really powerful conductor of

the coach merely with the best of what was their idea of civility, but

the driver was the only being they bowed down to and worshipped.  How

admiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he gloved

himself with lingering deliberation, while some happy hostler held the

bunch of reins aloft, and waited patiently for him to take it!  And how

they would bombard him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked his

long whip and went careering away.



The station buildings were long, low huts, made of sundried, mud-colored

bricks, laid up without mortar (adobes, the Spaniards call these bricks,

and Americans shorten it to 'dobies).  The roofs, which had no slant to

them worth speaking of, were thatched and then sodded or covered with a

thick layer of earth, and from this sprung a pretty rank growth of weeds

and grass.  It was the first time we had ever seen a man's front yard on

top of his house.  The building consisted of barns, stable-room for

twelve or fifteen horses, and a hut for an eating-room for passengers.

This latter had bunks in it for the station-keeper and a hostler or two.

You could rest your elbow on its eaves, and you had to bend in order to

get in at the door.  In place of a window there was a square hole about

large enough for a man to crawl through, but this had no glass in it.

There was no flooring, but the ground was packed hard.  There was no

stove, but the fire-place served all needful purposes.  There were no

shelves, no cupboards, no closets.  In a corner stood an open sack of

flour, and nestling against its base were a couple of black and venerable

tin coffee-pots, a tin teapot, a little bag of salt, and a side of bacon.





By the door of the station-keeper's den, outside, was a tin wash-basin,

on the ground.  Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow bar

soap, and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt, significantly--

but this latter was the station-keeper's private towel, and only two

persons in all the party might venture to use it--the stage-driver and

the conductor.  The latter would not, from a sense of decency; the former

would not, because did not choose to encourage the advances of a station-

keeper.  We had towels--in the valise; they might as well have been in

Sodom and Gomorrah.  We (and the conductor) used our handkerchiefs, and

the driver his pantaloons and sleeves.  By the door, inside, was fastened

a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame, with two little fragments of

the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it.  This arrangement

afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when you looked into

it, with one half of your head set up a couple of inches above the other

half.  From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a string--but if I

had to describe that patriarch or die, I believe I would order some

sample coffins.



It had come down from Esau and Samson, and had been accumulating hair

ever since--along with certain impurities.  In one corner of the room

stood three or four rifles and muskets, together with horns and pouches

of ammunition.  The station-men wore pantaloons of coarse, country-woven

stuff, and into the seat and the inside of the legs were sewed ample

additions of buckskin, to do duty in place of leggings, when the man rode

horseback--so the pants were half dull blue and half yellow, and

unspeakably picturesque.  The pants were stuffed into the tops of high

boots, the heels whereof were armed with great Spanish spurs, whose

little iron clogs and chains jingled with every step.  The man wore a

huge beard and mustachios, an old slouch hat, a blue woolen shirt, no

suspenders, no vest, no coat--in a leathern sheath in his belt, a great

long "navy" revolver (slung on right side, hammer to the front), and

projecting from his boot a horn-handled bowie-knife.  The furniture of

the hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way.  The rocking-chairs and

sofas were not present, and never had been, but they were represented by

two three-legged stools, a pine-board bench four feet long, and two empty

candle-boxes.  The table was a greasy board on stilts, and the table-

cloth and napkins had not come--and they were not looking for them,

either.  A battered tin platter, a knife and fork, and a tin pint cup,

were at each man's place, and the driver had a queens-ware saucer that

had seen better days.  Of course this duke sat at the head of the table.

There was one isolated piece of table furniture that bore about it a

touching air of grandeur in misfortune.  This was the caster.  It was

German silver, and crippled and rusty, but it was so preposterously out

of place there that it was suggestive of a tattered exiled king among

barbarians, and the majesty of its native position compelled respect even

in its degradation.



There was only one cruet left, and that was a stopperless, fly-specked,

broken-necked thing, with two inches of vinegar in it, and a dozen

preserved flies with their heels up and looking sorry they had invested

there.



The station-keeper upended a disk of last week's bread, of the shape and

size of an old-time cheese, and carved some slabs from it which were as

good as Nicholson pavement, and tenderer.



He sliced off a piece of bacon for each man, but only the experienced old

hands made out to eat it, for it was condemned army bacon which the

United States would not feed to its soldiers in the forts, and the stage

company had bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers and

employees.  We may have found this condemned army bacon further out on

the plains than the section I am locating it in, but we found it--there

is no gainsaying that.



Then he poured for us a beverage which he called "Slum gullion," and it

is hard to think he was not inspired when he named it.  It really

pretended to be tea, but there was too much dish-rag, and sand, and old

bacon-rind in it to deceive the intelligent traveler.



He had no sugar and no milk--not even a spoon to stir the ingredients

with.



We could not eat the bread or the meat, nor drink the "slumgullion." And

when I looked at that melancholy vinegar-cruet, I thought of the anecdote

(a very, very old one, even at that day) of the traveler who sat down to

a table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard.  He

asked the landlord if this was all.  The landlord said:



"All!  Why, thunder and lightning, I should think there was mackerel

enough there for six."



"But I don't like mackerel."



"Oh--then help yourself to the mustard."



In other days I had considered it a good, a very good, anecdote, but

there was a dismal plausibility about it, here, that took all the humor

out of it.



Our breakfast was before us, but our teeth were idle.



I tasted and smelt, and said I would take coffee, I believed.  The

station-boss stopped dead still, and glared at me speechless.  At last,

when he came to, he turned away and said, as one who communes with

himself upon a matter too vast to grasp:



"Coffee!  Well, if that don't go clean ahead of me, I'm d---d!"



We could not eat, and there was no conversation among the hostlers and

herdsmen--we all sat at the same board.  At least there was no

conversation further than a single hurried request, now and then, from

one employee to another.  It was always in the same form, and always

gruffly friendly.  Its western freshness and novelty startled me, at

first, and interested me; but it presently grew monotonous, and lost its

charm.  It was:



"Pass the bread, you son of a skunk!"  No, I forget--skunk was not the

word; it seems to me it was still stronger than that; I know it was, in

fact, but it is gone from my memory, apparently.  However, it is no

matter--probably it was too strong for print, anyway.  It is the landmark

in my memory which tells me where I first encountered the vigorous new

vernacular of the occidental plains and mountains.



We gave up the breakfast, and paid our dollar apiece and went back to our

mail-bag bed in the coach, and found comfort in our pipes.  Right here we

suffered the first diminution of our princely state.  We left our six

fine horses and took six mules in their place.  But they were wild

Mexican fellows, and a man had to stand at the head of each of them and

hold him fast while the driver gloved and got himself ready.  And when at

last he grasped the reins and gave the word, the men sprung suddenly away

from the mules' heads and the coach shot from the station as if it had

issued from a cannon.  How the frantic animals did scamper!  It was a

fierce and furious gallop--and the gait never altered for a moment till

we reeled off ten or twelve miles and swept up to the next collection of

little station-huts and stables.



So we flew along all day.  At 2 P.M.  the belt of timber that fringes the

North Platte and marks its windings through the vast level floor of the

Plains came in sight.  At 4 P.M.  we crossed a branch of the river, and

at 5 P.M.  we crossed the Platte itself, and landed at Fort Kearney,

fifty-six hours out from St. Joe--THREE HUNDRED MILES!



Now that was stage-coaching on the great overland, ten or twelve years

ago, when perhaps not more than ten men in America, all told, expected to

live to see a railroad follow that route to the Pacific.  But the

railroad is there, now, and it pictures a thousand odd comparisons and

contrasts in my mind to read the following sketch, in the New York Times,

of a recent trip over almost the very ground I have been describing.  I

can scarcely comprehend the new state of things:



     "ACROSS THE CONTINENT.



     "At 4.20 P.M., Sunday, we rolled out of the station at Omaha, and

     started westward on our long jaunt.  A couple of hours out, dinner

     was announced--an "event" to those of us who had yet to experience

     what it is to eat in one of Pullman's hotels on wheels; so, stepping

     into the car next forward of our sleeping palace, we found ourselves

     in the dining-car.  It was a revelation to us, that first dinner on

     Sunday.  And though we continued to dine for four days, and had as

     many breakfasts and suppers, our whole party never ceased to admire

     the perfection of the arrangements, and the marvelous results

     achieved.  Upon tables covered with snowy linen, and garnished with

     services of solid silver, Ethiop waiters, flitting about in spotless

     white, placed as by magic a repast at which Delmonico himself could

     have had no occasion to blush; and, indeed, in some respects it

     would be hard for that distinguished chef to match our menu; for, in

     addition to all that ordinarily makes up a first-chop dinner, had we

     not our antelope steak (the gormand who has not experienced this--

     bah! what does he know of the feast of fat things?) our delicious

     mountain-brook trout, and choice fruits and berries, and (sauce

     piquant and unpurchasable!) our sweet-scented, appetite-compelling

     air of the prairies?



     "You may depend upon it, we all did justice to the good things, and

     as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling Krug, whilst we

     sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour, agreed it was the

     fastest living we had ever experienced.  (We beat that, however, two

     days afterward when we made twenty-seven miles in twenty-seven

     minutes, while our Champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not

     a drop!) After dinner we repaired to our drawing-room car, and, as

     it was Sabbath eve, intoned some of the grand old hymns--"Praise God

     from whom," etc.; "Shining Shore," "Coronation," etc.--the voices of

     the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the

     evening air, while our train, with its great, glaring Polyphemus

     eye, lighting up long vistas of prairie, rushed into the night and

     the Wild.  Then to bed in luxurious couches, where we slept the

     sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning (Monday) at eight

     o'clock, to find ourselves at the crossing of the North Platte,

     three hundred miles from Omaha--fifteen hours and forty minutes

     out."









CHAPTER V.



Another night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil.  But morning came,

by and by.  It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses

of level greensward, bright sunlight, an impressive solitude utterly

without visible human beings or human habitations, and an atmosphere of

such amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand

were more than three mile away.  We resumed undress uniform, climbed

a-top of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted

occasionally at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears back

and scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing away,

and leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for things new

and strange to gaze at.  Even at this day it thrills me through and

through to think of the life, the gladness and the wild sense of freedom

that used to make the blood dance in my veins on those fine overland

mornings!



Along about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairie-dog

villages, the first antelope, and the first wolf.  If I remember rightly,

this latter was the regular cayote (pronounced ky-o-te) of the farther

deserts.  And if it was, he was not a pretty creature or respectable

either, for I got well acquainted with his race afterward, and can speak

with confidence.  The cayote is a long, slim, sick and sorry-looking

skeleton, with a gray wolf-skin stretched over it, a tolerably bushy tail

that forever sags down with a despairing expression of forsakenness and

misery, a furtive and evil eye, and a long, sharp face, with slightly

lifted lip and exposed teeth.  He has a general slinking expression all

over.  The cayote is a living, breathing allegory of Want.  He is always

hungry.



He is always poor, out of luck and friendless.  The meanest creatures

despise him, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede.  He is

so spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are

pretending a threat, the rest of his face is apologizing for it.  And he

is so homely!--so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful.

When he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, and

then turns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head

a bit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sage-brush,

glancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he is about

out of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes a deliberate survey

of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop again--another fifty and stop

again; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the gray of

the sage-brush, and he disappears.  All this is when you make no

demonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a livelier interest

in his journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a deal

of real estate between himself and your weapon, that by the time you have

raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle, and by the time

you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by the time you

have "drawn a bead" on him you see well enough that nothing but an

unusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where he is

now.  But if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy it

ever so much--especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of

himself, and has been brought up to think he knows something about speed.



The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his, and

every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder that

will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambition,

and make him lay his head still lower to the ground, and stretch his neck

further to the front, and pant more fiercely, and stick his tail out

straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy,

and leave a broader and broader, and higher and denser cloud of desert

sand smoking behind, and marking his long wake across the level plain!

And all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the cayote,

and to save the soul of him he cannot understand why it is that he cannot

get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get aggravated, and it makes him

madder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides along and never

pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he grows still more and more

incensed to see how shamefully he has been taken in by an entire

stranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long, calm, soft-footed trot

is; and next he notices that he is getting fagged, and that the cayote

actually has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away from

him--and then that town-dog is mad in earnest, and he begins to strain

and weep and swear, and paw the sand higher than ever, and reach for the

cayote with concentrated and desperate energy.  This "spurt" finds him

six feet behind the gliding enemy, and two miles from his friends.  And

then, in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face, the

cayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more, and with a something

about it which seems to say: "Well, I shall have to tear myself away from

you, bub--business is business, and it will not do for me to be fooling

along this way all day"--and forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the

sudden splitting of a long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that

dog is solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude!



It makes his head swim.  He stops, and looks all around; climbs the

nearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance; shakes his head

reflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs along back to

his train, and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon, and

feels unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, and hangs his tail at half-

mast for a week.  And for as much as a year after that, whenever there is

a great hue and cry after a cayote, that dog will merely glance in that

direction without emotion, and apparently observe to himself, "I believe

I do not wish any of the pie."



The cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding desert,

along with the lizard, the jackass-rabbit and the raven, and gets an

uncertain and precarious living, and earns it.  He seems to subsist

almost wholly on the carcases of oxen, mules and horses that have dropped

out of emigrant trains and died, and upon windfalls of carrion, and

occasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have been

opulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned army

bacon.



He will eat anything in the world that his first cousins, the desert-

frequenting tribes of Indians will, and they will eat anything they can

bite.  It is a curious fact that these latter are the only creatures

known to history who will eat nitro-glycerine and ask for more if they

survive.



The cayote of the deserts beyond the Rocky Mountains has a peculiarly

hard time of it, owing to the fact that his relations, the Indians, are

just as apt to be the first to detect a seductive scent on the desert

breeze, and follow the fragrance to the late ox it emanated from, as he

is himself; and when this occurs he has to content himself with sitting

off at a little distance watching those people strip off and dig out

everything edible, and walk off with it.  Then he and the waiting ravens

explore the skeleton and polish the bones.  It is considered that the

cayote, and the obscene bird, and the Indian of the desert, testify their

blood kinship with each other in that they live together in the waste

places of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and friendship, while

hating all other creature and yearning to assist at their funerals.  He

does not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast, and a hundred and fifty

to dinner, because he is sure to have three or four days between meals,

and he can just as well be traveling and looking at the scenery as lying

around doing nothing and adding to the burdens of his parents.



We soon learned to recognize the sharp, vicious bark of the cayote as it

came across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among the

mail-sacks; and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune, made

shift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long day's good luck and a

limitless larder the morrow.









CHAPTER VI.



Our new conductor (just shipped) had been without sleep for twenty hours.

Such a thing was very frequent.  From St. Joseph, Missouri, to

Sacramento, California, by stage-coach, was nearly nineteen hundred

miles, and the trip was often made in fifteen days (the cars do it in

four and a half, now), but the time specified in the mail contracts, and

required by the schedule, was eighteen or nineteen days, if I remember

rightly.  This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows,

and other unavoidable causes of detention.  The stage company had

everything under strict discipline and good system.  Over each two

hundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent,

and invested him with great authority.  His beat or jurisdiction of two

hundred and fifty miles was called a "division." He purchased horses,

mules harness, and food for men and beasts, and distributed these things

among his stage stations, from time to time, according to his judgment of

what each station needed.  He erected station buildings and dug wells.

He attended to the paying of the station-keepers, hostlers, drivers and

blacksmiths, and discharged them whenever he chose.  He was a very, very

great man in his "division"--a kind of Grand Mogul, a Sultan of the

Indies, in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner,

and in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stage-driver

dwindled to a penny dip.  There were about eight of these kings, all

told, on the overland route.



Next in rank and importance to the division-agent came the "conductor."

His beat was the same length as the agent's--two hundred and fifty miles.

He sat with the driver, and (when necessary) rode that fearful distance,

night and day, without other rest or sleep than what he could get perched

thus on top of the flying vehicle.  Think of it!  He had absolute charge

of the mails, express matter, passengers and stage, coach, until he

delivered them to the next conductor, and got his receipt for them.



Consequently he had to be a man of intelligence, decision and

considerable executive ability.  He was usually a quiet, pleasant man,

who attended closely to his duties, and was a good deal of a gentleman.

It was not absolutely necessary that the division-agent should be a

gentleman, and occasionally he wasn't.  But he was always a general in

administrative ability, and a bull-dog in courage and determination--

otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overland

service would never in any instance have been to him anything but an

equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and a

coffin at the end of it.  There were about sixteen or eighteen conductors

on the overland, for there was a daily stage each way, and a conductor on

every stage.



Next in real and official rank and importance, after the conductor, came

my delight, the driver--next in real but not in apparent importance--for

we have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the driver was to the

conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flag-ship.  The driver's

beat was pretty long, and his sleeping-time at the stations pretty short,

sometimes; and so, but for the grandeur of his position his would have

been a sorry life, as well as a hard and a wearing one.  We took a new

driver every day or every night (for they drove backward and forward over

the same piece of road all the time), and therefore we never got as well

acquainted with them as we did with the conductors; and besides, they

would have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengers,

anyhow, as a general thing.  Still, we were always eager to get a sight

of each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed, for each and

every day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one, or

loath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to be

sociable and friendly with.  And so the first question we asked the

conductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers, was

always, "Which is him?"  The grammar was faulty, maybe, but we could not

know, then, that it would go into a book some day.  As long as everything

went smoothly, the overland driver was well enough situated, but if a

fellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble, for the coach must go

on, and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxurious

rest after his long night's siege in the midst of wind and rain and

darkness, had to stay where he was and do the sick man's work.  Once, in

the Rocky Mountains, when I found a driver sound asleep on the box, and

the mules going at the usual break-neck pace, the conductor said never

mind him, there was no danger, and he was doing double duty--had driven

seventy-five miles on one coach, and was now going back over it on this

without rest or sleep.  A hundred and fifty miles of holding back of six

vindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees!  It sounds

incredible, but I remember the statement well enough.



The station-keepers, hostlers, etc., were low, rough characters, as

already described; and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerable

sprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlaws--fugitives from

justice, criminals whose best security was a section of country which was

without law and without even the pretence of it.  When the "division-

agent" issued an order to one of these parties he did it with the full

understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy six-shooter,

and so he always went "fixed" to make things go along smoothly.



Now and then a division-agent was really obliged to shoot a hostler

through the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have

taught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been

different.  But they were snappy, able men, those division-agents, and

when they tried to teach a subordinate anything, that subordinate

generally "got it through his head."



A great portion of this vast machinery--these hundreds of men and

coaches, and thousands of mules and horses--was in the hands of Mr. Ben

Holliday.  All the western half of the business was in his hands.  This

reminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here, so

I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in my

Holy Land note-book:



      No doubt everybody has heard of Ben Holliday--a man of prodigious

      energy, who used to send mails and passengers flying across the

      continent in his overland stage-coaches like a very whirlwind--two

      thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half, by the watch!  But

      this fragment of history is not about Ben Holliday, but about a

      young New York boy by the name of Jack, who traveled with our small

      party of pilgrims in the Holy Land (and who had traveled to

      California in Mr. Holliday's overland coaches three years before,

      and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of

      Mr. H.) Aged nineteen.  Jack was a good boy--a good-hearted and

      always well-meaning boy, who had been reared in the city of New

      York, and although he was bright and knew a great many useful

      things, his Scriptural education had been a good deal neglected--to

      such a degree, indeed, that all Holy Land history was fresh and new

      to him, and all Bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his

      virgin ear.



      Also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of

      Jack, in that he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast

      concerning them.  He was our encyclopedia, and we were never tired

      of listening to his speeches, nor he of making them.  He never

      passed a celebrated locality, from Bashan to Bethlehem, without

      illuminating it with an oration.  One day, when camped near the

      ruins of Jericho, he burst forth with something like this:



      "Jack, do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds

      the Jordan valley?  The mountains of Moab, Jack!  Think of it, my

      boy--the actual mountains of Moab--renowned in Scripture history!

      We are actually standing face to face with those illustrious crags

      and peaks--and for all we know" [dropping his voice impressively],

      "our eyes may be resting at this very moment upon the spot WHERE

      LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES!  Think of it, Jack!"



      "Moses who?"  (falling inflection).



      "Moses who!  Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself--you ought to

      be ashamed of such criminal ignorance.  Why, Moses, the great guide,

      soldier, poet, lawgiver of ancient Israel!  Jack, from this spot

      where we stand, to Egypt, stretches a fearful desert three hundred

      miles in extent--and across that desert that wonderful man brought

      the children of Israel!--guiding them with unfailing sagacity for

      forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing

      rocks and hills, and landed them at last, safe and sound, within

      sight of this very spot; and where we now stand they entered the

      Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing!  It was a wonderful,

      wonderful thing to do, Jack!  Think of it!"



      "Forty years?  Only three hundred miles?  Humph!  Ben Holliday would

      have fetched them through in thirty-six hours!"



The boy meant no harm.  He did not know that he had said anything that

was wrong or irreverent.  And so no one scolded him or felt offended with

him--and nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing

the heedless blunders of a boy.



At noon on the fifth day out, we arrived at the "Crossing of the South

Platte," alias "Julesburg," alias "Overland City," four hundred and

seventy miles from St. Joseph--the strangest, quaintest, funniest

frontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been

astonished with.









CHAPTER VII.



It did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to us

such a long acquaintance with deep, still, almost lifeless and houseless

solitude!  We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric

people crumbled off the corner of some other world, and wakened up

suddenly in this.  For an hour we took as much interest in Overland City

as if we had never seen a town before.  The reason we had an hour to

spare was because we had to change our stage (for a less sumptuous

affair, called a "mud-wagon") and transfer our freight of mails.



Presently we got under way again.  We came to the shallow, yellow, muddy

South Platte, with its low banks and its scattering flat sand-bars and

pigmy islands--a melancholy stream straggling through the centre of the

enormous flat plain, and only saved from being impossible to find with

the naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on either

bank.  The Platte was "up," they said--which made me wish I could see it

when it was down, if it could look any sicker and sorrier.  They said it

was a dangerous stream to cross, now, because its quicksands were liable

to swallow up horses, coach and passengers if an attempt was made to ford

it.  But the mails had to go, and we made the attempt.  Once or twice in

midstream the wheels sunk into the yielding sands so threateningly that

we half believed we had dreaded and avoided the sea all our lives to be

shipwrecked in a "mud-wagon" in the middle of a desert at last.  But we

dragged through and sped away toward the setting sun.



Next morning, just before dawn, when about five hundred and fifty miles

from St. Joseph, our mud-wagon broke down.  We were to be delayed five or

six hours, and therefore we took horses, by invitation, and joined a

party who were just starting on a buffalo hunt.  It was noble sport

galloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning, but our

part of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace, for a wounded buffalo

bull chased the passenger Bemis nearly two miles, and then he forsook his

horse and took to a lone tree.  He was very sullen about the matter for

some twenty-four hours, but at last he began to soften little by little,

and finally he said:



"Well, it was not funny, and there was no sense in those gawks making

themselves so facetious over it.  I tell you I was angry in earnest for

awhile.  I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank, if

I could have done it without crippling six or seven other people--but of

course I couldn't, the old 'Allen's' so confounded comprehensive.  I wish

those loafers had been up in the tree; they wouldn't have wanted to laugh

so.  If I had had a horse worth a cent--but no, the minute he saw that

buffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow, he raised straight up in the

air and stood on his heels.  The saddle began to slip, and I took him

round the neck and laid close to him, and began to pray.  Then he came

down and stood up on the other end awhile, and the bull actually stopped

pawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacle.



"Then the bull made a pass at him and uttered a bellow that sounded

perfectly frightful, it was so close to me, and that seemed to literally

prostrate my horse's reason, and make a raving distracted maniac of him,

and I wish I may die if he didn't stand on his head for a quarter of a

minute and shed tears.  He was absolutely out of his mind--he was, as

sure as truth itself, and he really didn't know what he was doing.  Then

the bull came charging at us, and my horse dropped down on all fours and

took a fresh start--and then for the next ten minutes he would actually

throw one hand-spring after another so fast that the bull began to get

unsettled, too, and didn't know where to start in--and so he stood there

sneezing, and shovelling dust over his back, and bellowing every now and

then, and thinking he had got a fifteen-hundred dollar circus horse for

breakfast, certain.  Well, I was first out on his neck--the horse's, not

the bull's--and then underneath, and next on his rump, and sometimes head

up, and sometimes heels--but I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be

ripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death, as you

might say.  Pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away

some of my horse's tail (I suppose, but do not know, being pretty busy at

the time), but something made him hungry for solitude and suggested to

him to get up and hunt for it.



"And then you ought to have seen that spider legged old skeleton go! and

you ought to have seen the bull cut out after him, too--head down, tongue

out, tail up, bellowing like everything, and actually mowing down the

weeds, and tearing up the earth, and boosting up the sand like a

whirlwind!  By George, it was a hot race!  I and the saddle were back on

the rump, and I had the bridle in my teeth and holding on to the pommel

with both hands.  First we left the dogs behind; then we passed a jackass

rabbit; then we overtook a cayote, and were gaining on an antelope when

the rotten girth let go and threw me about thirty yards off to the left,

and as the saddle went down over the horse's rump he gave it a lift with

his heels that sent it more than four hundred yards up in the air, I wish

I may die in a minute if he didn't.  I fell at the foot of the only

solitary tree there was in nine counties adjacent (as any creature could

see with the naked eye), and the next second I had hold of the bark with

four sets of nails and my teeth, and the next second after that I was

astraddle of the main limb and blaspheming my luck in a way that made my

breath smell of brimstone.  I had the bull, now, if he did not think of

one thing.  But that one thing I dreaded.  I dreaded it very seriously.

There was a possibility that the bull might not think of it, but there

were greater chances that he would.  I made up my mind what I would do in

case he did.  It was a little over forty feet to the ground from where I

sat.  I cautiously unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddle----"



"Your saddle?  Did you take your saddle up in the tree with you?"



"Take it up in the tree with me?  Why, how you talk.  Of course I didn't.

No man could do that.  It fell in the tree when it came down."



"Oh--exactly."



"Certainly.  I unwound the lariat, and fastened one end of it to the

limb.  It was the very best green raw-hide, and capable of sustaining

tons.  I made a slip-noose in the other end, and then hung it down to see

the length.  It reached down twenty-two feet--half way to the ground.

I then loaded every barrel of the Allen with a double charge.  I felt

satisfied.  I said to myself, if he never thinks of that one thing that I

dread, all right--but if he does, all right anyhow--I am fixed for him.

But don't you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing that

always happens?  Indeed it is so.  I watched the bull, now, with anxiety

--anxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such a

situation and felt that at any moment death might come.  Presently a

thought came into the bull's eye.  I knew it! said I--if my nerve fails

now, I am lost.  Sure enough, it was just as I had dreaded, he started in

to climb the tree----"



"What, the bull?"



"Of course--who else?"



"But a bull can't climb a tree."



"He can't, can't he?  Since you know so much about it, did you ever see a

bull try?"



"No!  I never dreamt of such a thing."



"Well, then, what is the use of your talking that way, then?  Because you

never saw a thing done, is that any reason why it can't be done?"



"Well, all right--go on.  What did you do?"



"The bull started up, and got along well for about ten feet, then slipped

and slid back.  I breathed easier.  He tried it again--got up a little

higher--slipped again.  But he came at it once more, and this time he was

careful.  He got gradually higher and higher, and my spirits went down

more and more.  Up he came--an inch at a time--with his eyes hot, and his

tongue hanging out.  Higher and higher--hitched his foot over the stump

of a limb, and looked up, as much as to say, 'You are my meat, friend.'

Up again--higher and higher, and getting more excited the closer he got.

He was within ten feet of me!  I took a long breath,--and then said I,

'It is now or never.'  I had the coil of the lariat all ready; I paid it

out slowly, till it hung right over his head; all of a sudden I let go of

the slack, and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck!  Quicker than

lightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the face.  It was

an awful roar, and must have scared the bull out of his senses.  When the

smoke cleared away, there he was, dangling in the air, twenty foot from

the ground, and going out of one convulsion into another faster than you

could count!  I didn't stop to count, anyhow--I shinned down the tree and

shot for home."



"Bemis, is all that true, just as you have stated it?"



"I wish I may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it isn't."



"Well, we can't refuse to believe it, and we don't.  But if there were

some proofs----"



"Proofs!  Did I bring back my lariat?"



"No."



"Did I bring back my horse?"



"No."



"Did you ever see the bull again?"



"No."



"Well, then, what more do you want?  I never saw anybody as particular as

you are about a little thing like that."



I made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it by

the skin of his teeth.  This episode reminds me of an incident of my

brief sojourn in Siam, years afterward.  The European citizens of a town

in the neighborhood of Bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name of

Eckert, an Englishman--a person famous for the number, ingenuity and

imposing magnitude of his lies.  They were always repeating his most

celebrated falsehoods, and always trying to "draw him out" before

strangers; but they seldom succeeded.  Twice he was invited to the house

where I was visiting, but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lie.

One day a planter named Bascom, an influential man, and a proud and

sometimes irascible one, invited me to ride over with him and call on

Eckert.  As we jogged along, said he:



"Now, do you know where the fault lies?  It lies in putting Eckert on his

guard.  The minute the boys go to pumping at Eckert he knows perfectly

well what they are after, and of course he shuts up his shell.  Anybody

might know he would.  But when we get there, we must play him finer than

that.  Let him shape the conversation to suit himself--let him drop it or

change it whenever he wants to.  Let him see that nobody is trying to

draw him out.  Just let him have his own way.  He will soon forget

himself and begin to grind out lies like a mill.  Don't get impatient--

just keep quiet, and let me play him.  I will make him lie.  It does seem

to me that the boys must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simple

trick as that."



Eckert received us heartily--a pleasant-spoken, gentle-mannered creature.

We sat in the veranda an hour, sipping English ale, and talking about the

king, and the sacred white elephant, the Sleeping Idol, and all manner of

things; and I noticed that my comrade never led the conversation himself

or shaped it, but simply followed Eckert's lead, and betrayed no

solicitude and no anxiety about anything.  The effect was shortly

perceptible.  Eckert began to grow communicative; he grew more and more

at his ease, and more and more talkative and sociable.  Another hour

passed in the same way, and then all of a sudden Eckert said:



"Oh, by the way!  I came near forgetting.  I have got a thing here to

astonish you.  Such a thing as neither you nor any other man ever heard

of--I've got a cat that will eat cocoanut!  Common green cocoanut--and

not only eat the meat, but drink the milk.  It is so--I'll swear to it."



A quick glance from Bascom--a glance that I understood--then:



"Why, bless my soul, I never heard of such a thing.  Man, it is

impossible."



"I knew you would say it.  I'll fetch the cat."



He went in the house.  Bascom said:



"There--what did I tell you?  Now, that is the way to handle Eckert.  You

see, I have petted him along patiently, and put his suspicions to sleep.

I am glad we came.  You tell the boys about it when you go back.  Cat eat

a cocoanut--oh, my!  Now, that is just his way, exactly--he will tell the

absurdest lie, and trust to luck to get out of it again.



"Cat eat a cocoanut--the innocent fool!"



Eckert approached with his cat, sure enough.



Bascom smiled.  Said he:



"I'll hold the cat--you bring a cocoanut."



Eckert split one open, and chopped up some pieces.  Bascom smuggled a

wink to me, and proffered a slice of the fruit to puss.  She snatched it,

swallowed it ravenously, and asked for more!



We rode our two miles in silence, and wide apart.  At least I was silent,

though Bascom cuffed his horse and cursed him a good deal,

notwithstanding the horse was behaving well enough.  When I branched off

homeward, Bascom said:



"Keep the horse till morning.  And--you need not speak of this--

foolishness to the boys."









CHAPTER VIII.



In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and

watching for the "pony-rider"--the fleet messenger who sped across the

continent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen hundred

miles in eight days!  Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh

and blood to do!  The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man,

brimful of spirit and endurance.  No matter what time of the day or night

his watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer,

raining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his "beat" was a level

straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices, or

whether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with

hostile Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be

off like the wind!  There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty.

He rode fifty miles without stopping, by daylight, moonlight, starlight,

or through the blackness of darkness--just as it happened.  He rode a

splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a

gentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he

came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a fresh,

impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in the

twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were out of sight

before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look.  Both rider

and horse went "flying light." The rider's dress was thin, and fitted

close; he wore a "round-about," and a skull-cap, and tucked his

pantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider.  He carried no arms--he

carried nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage

on his literary freight was worth five dollars a letter.



He got but little frivolous correspondence to carry--his bag had business

letters in it, mostly.  His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight,

too.  He wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and no visible blanket.

He wore light shoes, or none at all.  The little flat mail-pockets

strapped under the rider's thighs would each hold about the bulk of a

child's primer.  They held many and many an important business chapter

and newspaper letter, but these were written on paper as airy and thin as

gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and weight were economized.  The stage-

coach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day

(twenty-four hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty.  There

were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day,

stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to California,

forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and among them making

four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of

scenery every single day in the year.



We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,

but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to

streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the

swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out of

the windows.  But now we were expecting one along every moment, and would

see him in broad daylight.  Presently the driver exclaims:



"HERE HE COMES!"



Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider.  Away

across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears

against the sky, and it is plain that it moves.  Well, I should think so!



In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,

rising and falling--sweeping toward us nearer and nearer--growing more

and more distinct, more and more sharply defined--nearer and still

nearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear--another

instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider's

hand, but no reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces, and

go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm!



So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for

the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack after

the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted whether

we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.



We rattled through Scott's Bluffs Pass, by and by.  It was along here

somewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali water

in the road, and we cordially hailed it as a first-class curiosity, and a

thing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the ignorant at home.

This water gave the road a soapy appearance, and in many places the

ground looked as if it had been whitewashed.  I think the strange alkali

water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon yet, and I know

we felt very complacent and conceited, and better satisfied with life

after we had added it to our list of things which we had seen and some

other people had not.  In a small way we were the same sort of simpletons

as those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks of Mont Blanc and the

Matterhorn, and derive no pleasure from it except the reflection that it

isn't a common experience.  But once in a while one of those parties

trips and comes darting down the long mountain-crags in a sitting

posture, making the crusted snow smoke behind him, flitting from bench to

bench, and from terrace to terrace, jarring the earth where he strikes,

and still glancing and flitting on again, sticking an iceberg into

himself every now and then, and tearing his clothes, snatching at things

to save himself, taking hold of trees and fetching them along with him,

roots and all, starting little rocks now and then, then big boulders,

then acres of ice and snow and patches of forest, gathering and still

gathering as he goes, adding and still adding to his massed and sweeping

grandeur as he nears a three thousand-foot precipice, till at last he

waves his hat magnificently and rides into eternity on the back of a

raging and tossing avalanche!



This is all very fine, but let us not be carried away by excitement, but

ask calmly, how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments next

day, with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of him?



We crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery and

massacre of 1856, wherein the driver and conductor perished, and also all

the passengers but one, it was supposed; but this must have been a

mistake, for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I was

personally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people who

were wounded during that massacre, and barely escaped with their lives.

There was no doubt of the truth of it--I had it from their own lips.  One

of these parties told me that he kept coming across arrow-heads in his

system for nearly seven years after the massacre; and another of them

told me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after the

Indians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself, he could not

restrain his tears, for his clothes were completely ruined.



The most trustworthy tradition avers, however, that only one man, a

person named Babbitt, survived the massacre, and he was desperately

wounded.  He dragged himself on his hands and knee (for one leg was

broken) to a station several miles away.  He did it during portions of

two nights, lying concealed one day and part of another, and for more

than forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger, thirst and

bodily pain.  The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained,

including quite an amount of treasure.









CHAPTER IX.



We passed Fort Laramie in the night, and on the seventh morning out we

found ourselves in the Black Hills, with Laramie Peak at our elbow

(apparently) looming vast and solitary--a deep, dark, rich indigo blue in

hue, so portentously did the old colossus frown under his beetling brows

of storm-cloud.  He was thirty or forty miles away, in reality, but he

only seemed removed a little beyond the low ridge at our right.  We

breakfasted at Horse-Shoe Station, six hundred and seventy-six miles out

from St. Joseph.  We had now reached a hostile Indian country, and during

the afternoon we passed Laparelle Station, and enjoyed great discomfort

all the time we were in the neighborhood, being aware that many of the

trees we dashed by at arm's length concealed a lurking Indian or two.

During the preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through

the pony-rider's jacket, but he had ridden on, just the same, because

pony-riders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except

when killed.  As long as they had life enough left in them they had to

stick to the horse and ride, even if the Indians had been waiting for

them a week, and were entirely out of patience.  About two hours and a

half before we arrived at Laparelle Station, the keeper in charge of it

had fired four times at an Indian, but he said with an injured air that

the Indian had "skipped around so's to spile everything--and ammunition's

blamed skurse, too." The most natural inference conveyed by his manner of

speaking was, that in "skipping around," the Indian had taken an unfair

advantage.



The coach we were in had a neat hole through its front--a reminiscence of

its last trip through this region.  The bullet that made it wounded the

driver slightly, but he did not mind it much.  He said the place to keep

a man "huffy" was down on the Southern Overland, among the Apaches,

before the company moved the stage line up on the northern route.  He

said the Apaches used to annoy him all the time down there, and that he

came as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundance,

because they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he "couldn't hold

his vittles."



This person's statement were not generally believed.



We shut the blinds down very tightly that first night in the hostile

Indian country, and lay on our arms.  We slept on them some, but most of

the time we only lay on them.  We did not talk much, but kept quiet and

listened.  It was an inky-black night, and occasionally rainy.  We were

among woods and rocks, hills and gorges--so shut in, in fact, that when

we peeped through a chink in a curtain, we could discern nothing.  The

driver and conductor on top were still, too, or only spoke at long

intervals, in low tones, as is the way of men in the midst of invisible

dangers.  We listened to rain-drops pattering on the roof; and the

grinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel; and the low wailing of

the wind; and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us, inseparable

from travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle, the sense of remaining

perfectly still in one place, notwithstanding the jolting and swaying of

the vehicle, the trampling of the horses, and the grinding of the wheels.

We listened a long time, with intent faculties and bated breath; every

time one of us would relax, and draw a long sigh of relief and start to

say something, a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden "Hark!" and

instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again.  So the

tiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away, until at last our

tense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness, and we slept, if one

might call such a condition by so strong a name--for it was a sleep set

with a hair-trigger.  It was a sleep seething and teeming with a weird

and distressful confusion of shreds and fag-ends of dreams--a sleep that

was a chaos.  Presently, dreams and sleep and the sullen hush of the

night were startled by a ringing report, and cloven by such a long, wild,

agonizing shriek!  Then we heard--ten steps from the stage--



"Help!  help!  help!" [It was our driver's voice.]



"Kill him!  Kill him like a dog!"



"I'm being murdered!  Will no man lend me a pistol?"



"Look out! head him off! head him off!"



[Two pistol shots; a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feet,

as if a crowd were closing and surging together around some object;

several heavy, dull blows, as with a club; a voice that said appealingly,

"Don't, gentlemen, please don't--I'm a dead man!" Then a fainter groan,

and another blow, and away sped the stage into the darkness, and left the

grisly mystery behind us.]



What a startle it was!  Eight seconds would amply cover the time it

occupied--maybe even five would do it.  We only had time to plunge at a

curtain and unbuckle and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hindering

flurry, when our whip cracked sharply overhead, and we went rumbling and

thundering away, down a mountain "grade."



We fed on that mystery the rest of the night--what was left of it, for it

was waning fast.  It had to remain a present mystery, for all we could

get from the conductor in answer to our hails was something that sounded,

through the clatter of the wheels, like "Tell you in the morning!"



So we lit our pipes and opened the corner of a curtain for a chimney, and

lay there in the dark, listening to each other's story of how he first

felt and how many thousand Indians he first thought had hurled themselves

upon us, and what his remembrance of the subsequent sounds was, and the

order of their occurrence.  And we theorized, too, but there was never a

theory that would account for our driver's voice being out there, nor yet

account for his Indian murderers talking such good English, if they were

Indians.



So we chatted and smoked the rest of the night comfortably away, our

boding anxiety being somehow marvelously dissipated by the real presence

of something to be anxious about.



We never did get much satisfaction about that dark occurrence.  All that

we could make out of the odds and ends of the information we gathered in

the morning, was that the disturbance occurred at a station; that we

changed drivers there, and that the driver that got off there had been

talking roughly about some of the outlaws that infested the region ("for

there wasn't a man around there but had a price on his head and didn't

dare show himself in the settlements," the conductor said); he had talked

roughly about these characters, and ought to have "drove up there with

his pistol cocked and ready on the seat alongside of him, and begun

business himself, because any softy would know they would be laying for

him."



That was all we could gather, and we could see that neither the conductor

nor the new driver were much concerned about the matter.  They plainly

had little respect for a man who would deliver offensive opinions of

people and then be so simple as to come into their presence unprepared to

"back his judgment," as they pleasantly phrased the killing of any

fellow-being who did not like said opinions.  And likewise they plainly

had a contempt for the man's poor discretion in venturing to rouse the

wrath of such utterly reckless wild beasts as those outlaws--and the

conductor added:



"I tell you it's as much as Slade himself want to do!"



This remark created an entire revolution in my curiosity.  I cared

nothing now about the Indians, and even lost interest in the murdered

driver.  There was such magic in that name, SLADE!  Day or night, now, I

stood always ready to drop any subject in hand, to listen to something

new about Slade and his ghastly exploits.  Even before we got to Overland

City, we had begun to hear about Slade and his "division" (for he was a

"division-agent") on the Overland; and from the hour we had left Overland

City we had heard drivers and conductors talk about only three things--

"Californy," the Nevada silver mines, and this desperado Slade.  And a

deal the most of the talk was about Slade.  We had gradually come to have

a realizing sense of the fact that Slade was a man whose heart and hands

and soul were steeped in the blood of offenders against his dignity; a

man who awfully avenged all injuries, affront, insults or slights, of

whatever kind--on the spot if he could, years afterward if lack of

earlier opportunity compelled it; a man whose hate tortured him day and

night till vengeance appeased it--and not an ordinary vengeance either,

but his enemy's absolute death--nothing less; a man whose face would

light up with a terrible joy when he surprised a foe and had him at a

disadvantage.  A high and efficient servant of the Overland, an outlaw

among outlaws and yet their relentless scourge, Slade was at once the

most bloody, the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen that

inhabited the savage fastnesses of the mountains.









CHAPTER X.



Really and truly, two thirds of the talk of drivers and conductors had

been about this man Slade, ever since the day before we reached

Julesburg.  In order that the eastern reader may have a clear conception

of what a Rocky Mountain desperado is, in his highest state of

development, I will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one

straightforward narrative, and present it in the following shape:



Slade was born in Illinois, of good parentage.  At about twenty-six years

of age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country.  At St. Joseph,

Missouri, he joined one of the early California-bound emigrant trains,

and was given the post of train-master.  One day on the plains he had an

angry dispute with one of his wagon-drivers, and both drew their

revolvers.  But the driver was the quicker artist, and had his weapon

cocked first.  So Slade said it was a pity to waste life on so small a

matter, and proposed that the pistols be thrown on the ground and the

quarrel settled by a fist-fight.  The unsuspecting driver agreed, and

threw down his pistol--whereupon Slade laughed at his simplicity, and

shot him dead!



He made his escape, and lived a wild life for awhile, dividing his time

between fighting Indians and avoiding an Illinois sheriff, who had been

sent to arrest him for his first murder.  It is said that in one Indian

battle he killed three savages with his own hand, and afterward cut their

ears off and sent them, with his compliments, to the chief of the tribe.



Slade soon gained a name for fearless resolution, and this was sufficient

merit to procure for him the important post of overland division-agent at

Julesburg, in place of Mr. Jules, removed.  For some time previously, the

company's horses had been frequently stolen, and the coaches delayed, by

gangs of outlaws, who were wont to laugh at the idea of any man's having

the temerity to resent such outrages.  Slade resented them promptly.



The outlaws soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fear

anything that breathed the breath of life.  He made short work of all

offenders.  The result was that delays ceased, the company's property was

let alone, and no matter what happened or who suffered, Slade's coaches

went through, every time!  True, in order to bring about this wholesome

change, Slade had to kill several men--some say three, others say four,

and others six--but the world was the richer for their loss.  The first

prominent difficulty he had was with the ex-agent Jules, who bore the

reputation of being a reckless and desperate man himself.  Jules hated

Slade for supplanting him, and a good fair occasion for a fight was all

he was waiting for.  By and by Slade dared to employ a man whom Jules had

once discharged.  Next, Slade seized a team of stage-horses which he

accused Jules of having driven off and hidden somewhere for his own use.

War was declared, and for a day or two the two men walked warily about

the streets, seeking each other, Jules armed with a double-barreled shot

gun, and Slade with his history-creating revolver.  Finally, as Slade

stepped into a store Jules poured the contents of his gun into him from

behind the door.  Slade was plucky, and Jules got several bad pistol

wounds in return.



Then both men fell, and were carried to their respective lodgings, both

swearing that better aim should do deadlier work next time.  Both were

bedridden a long time, but Jules got to his feet first, and gathering his

possessions together, packed them on a couple of mules, and fled to the

Rocky Mountains to gather strength in safety against the day of

reckoning.  For many months he was not seen or heard of, and was

gradually dropped out of the remembrance of all save Slade himself.  But

Slade was not the man to forget him.  On the contrary, common report said

that Slade kept a reward standing for his capture, dead or alive!



After awhile, seeing that Slade's energetic administration had restored

peace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road, the overland

stage company transferred him to the Rocky Ridge division in the Rocky

Mountains, to see if he could perform a like miracle there.  It was the

very paradise of outlaws and desperadoes.  There was absolutely no

semblance of law there.  Violence was the rule.  Force was the only

recognized authority.  The commonest misunderstandings were settled on

the spot with the revolver or the knife.  Murders were done in open day,

and with sparkling frequency, and nobody thought of inquiring into them.

It was considered that the parties who did the killing had their private

reasons for it; for other people to meddle would have been looked upon as

indelicate.  After a murder, all that Rocky Mountain etiquette required

of a spectator was, that he should help the gentleman bury his game--

otherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him the

first time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn in

interring him.



Slade took up his residence sweetly and peacefully in the midst of this

hive of horse-thieves and assassins, and the very first time one of them

aired his insolent swaggerings in his presence he shot him dead!  He

began a raid on the outlaws, and in a singularly short space of time he

had completely stopped their depredations on the stage stock, recovered a

large number of stolen horses, killed several of the worst desperadoes of

the district, and gained such a dread ascendancy over the rest that they

respected him, admired him, feared him, obeyed him!  He wrought the same

marvelous change in the ways of the community that had marked his

administration at Overland City.  He captured two men who had stolen

overland stock, and with his own hands he hanged them.  He was supreme

judge in his district, and he was jury and executioner likewise--and not

only in the case of offences against his employers, but against passing

emigrants as well.  On one occasion some emigrants had their stock lost

or stolen, and told Slade, who chanced to visit their camp.  With a

single companion he rode to a ranch, the owners of which he suspected,

and opening the door, commenced firing, killing three, and wounding the

fourth.



From a bloodthirstily interesting little Montana book.--["The Vigilantes

of Montana," by Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale.]--I take this paragraph:



      "While on the road, Slade held absolute sway.  He would ride down to

      a station, get into a quarrel, turn the house out of windows, and

      maltreat the occupants most cruelly.  The unfortunates had no means

      of redress, and were compelled to recuperate as best they could."



On one of these occasions, it is said he killed the father of the fine

little half-breed boy Jemmy, whom he adopted, and who lived with his

widow after his execution.  Stories of Slade's hanging men, and of

innumerable assaults, shootings, stabbings and beatings, in which he was

a principal actor, form part of the legends of the stage line.  As for

minor quarrels and shootings, it is absolutely certain that a minute

history of Slade's life would be one long record of such practices.



Slade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver.  The legends say

that one morning at Rocky Ridge, when he was feeling comfortable, he saw

a man approaching who had offended him some days before--observe the fine

memory he had for matters like that--and, "Gentlemen," said Slade,

drawing, "it is a good twenty-yard shot--I'll clip the third button on

his coat!"  Which he did.  The bystanders all admired it.  And they all

attended the funeral, too.



On one occasion a man who kept a little whisky-shelf at the station did

something which angered Slade--and went and made his will.  A day or two

afterward Slade came in and called for some brandy.  The man reached

under the counter (ostensibly to get a bottle--possibly to get something

else), but Slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and satisfied

smile of his which the neighbors had long ago learned to recognize as a

death-warrant in disguise, and told him to "none of that!--pass out the

high-priced article."  So the poor bar-keeper had to turn his back and

get the high-priced brandy from the shelf; and when he faced around again

he was looking into the muzzle of Slade's pistol.  "And the next

instant," added my informant, impressively, "he was one of the deadest

men that ever lived."



The stage-drivers and conductors told us that sometimes Slade would leave

a hated enemy wholly unmolested, unnoticed and unmentioned, for weeks

together--had done it once or twice at any rate.  And some said they

believed he did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness, so

that he could get the advantage of them, and others said they believed he

saved up an enemy that way, just as a schoolboy saves up a cake, and made

the pleasure go as far as it would by gloating over the anticipation.

One of these cases was that of a Frenchman who had offended Slade.

To the surprise of everybody Slade did not kill him on the spot, but let

him alone for a considerable time.  Finally, however, he went to the

Frenchman's house very late one night, knocked, and when his enemy opened

the door, shot him dead--pushed the corpse inside the door with his foot,

set the house on fire and burned up the dead man, his widow and three

children!  I heard this story from several different people, and they

evidently believed what they were saying.  It may be true, and it may

not.  "Give a dog a bad name," etc.



Slade was captured, once, by a party of men who intended to lynch him.

They disarmed him, and shut him up in a strong log-house, and placed a

guard over him.  He prevailed on his captors to send for his wife, so

that he might have a last interview with her.  She was a brave, loving,

spirited woman.  She jumped on a horse and rode for life and death.

When she arrived they let her in without searching her, and before the

door could be closed she whipped out a couple of revolvers, and she and

her lord marched forth defying the party.  And then, under a brisk fire,

they mounted double and galloped away unharmed!



In the fulness of time Slade's myrmidons captured his ancient enemy

Jules, whom they found in a well-chosen hiding-place in the remote

fastnesses of the mountains, gaining a precarious livelihood with his

rifle.  They brought him to Rocky Ridge, bound hand and foot, and

deposited him in the middle of the cattle-yard with his back against a

post.  It is said that the pleasure that lit Slade's face when he heard

of it was something fearful to contemplate.  He examined his enemy to see

that he was securely tied, and then went to bed, content to wait till

morning before enjoying the luxury of killing him.  Jules spent the night

in the cattle-yard, and it is a region where warm nights are never known.

In the morning Slade practised on him with his revolver, nipping the

flesh here and there, and occasionally clipping off a finger, while Jules

begged him to kill him outright and put him out of his misery.  Finally

Slade reloaded, and walking up close to his victim, made some

characteristic remarks and then dispatched him.  The body lay there half

a day, nobody venturing to touch it without orders, and then Slade

detailed a party and assisted at the burial himself.  But he first cut

off the dead man's ears and put them in his vest pocket, where he carried

them for some time with great satisfaction.  That is the story as I have

frequently heard it told and seen it in print in California newspapers.

It is doubtless correct in all essential particulars.



In due time we rattled up to a stage-station, and sat down to breakfast

with a half-savage, half-civilized company of armed and bearded

mountaineers, ranchmen and station employees.  The most gentlemanly-

appearing, quiet and affable officer we had yet found along the road in

the Overland Company's service was the person who sat at the head of the

table, at my elbow.  Never youth stared and shivered as I did when I

heard them call him SLADE!



Here was romance, and I sitting face to face with it!--looking upon it--

touching it--hobnobbing with it, as it were!  Here, right by my side, was

the actual ogre who, in fights and brawls and various ways, had taken the

lives of twenty-six human beings, or all men lied about him!  I suppose I

was the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange lands and

wonderful people.



He was so friendly and so gentle-spoken that I warmed to him in spite of

his awful history.  It was hardly possible to realize that this pleasant

person was the pitiless scourge of the outlaws, the raw-head-and-bloody-

bones the nursing mothers of the mountains terrified their children with.

And to this day I can remember nothing remarkable about Slade except that

his face was rather broad across the cheek bones, and that the cheek

bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin and straight.  But that was

enough to leave something of an effect upon me, for since then I seldom

see a face possessing those characteristics without fancying that the

owner of it is a dangerous man.



The coffee ran out.  At least it was reduced to one tin-cupful, and Slade

was about to take it when he saw that my cup was empty.



He politely offered to fill it, but although I wanted it, I politely

declined.  I was afraid he had not killed anybody that morning, and might

be needing diversion.  But still with firm politeness he insisted on

filling my cup, and said I had traveled all night and better deserved it

than he--and while he talked he placidly poured the fluid, to the last

drop.  I thanked him and drank it, but it gave me no comfort, for I could

not feel sure that he would not be sorry, presently, that he had given it

away, and proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the loss.

But nothing of the kind occurred.  We left him with only twenty-six dead

people to account for, and I felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thought

that in so judiciously taking care of No. 1 at that breakfast-table I had

pleasantly escaped being No. 27.  Slade came out to the coach and saw us

off, first ordering certain rearrangements of the mail-bags for our

comfort, and then we took leave of him, satisfied that we should hear of

him again, some day, and wondering in what connection.









CHAPTER XI.



And sure enough, two or three years afterward, we did hear him again.

News came to the Pacific coast that the Vigilance Committee in Montana

(whither Slade had removed from Rocky Ridge) had hanged him.  I find an

account of the affair in the thrilling little book I quoted a paragraph

from in the last chapter--"The Vigilantes of Montana; being a Reliable

Account of the Capture, Trial and Execution of Henry Plummer's Notorious

Road Agent Band: By Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale, Virginia City, M.T."

Mr. Dimsdale's chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of how the

people of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove

inefficient.  Mr. Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade, both of which

are accurately descriptive, and one of which is exceedingly picturesque:

"Those who saw him in his natural state only, would pronounce him to be a

kind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman; on the

contrary, those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by a

gang of armed roughs, would pronounce him a fiend incarnate."  And this:

"From Fort Kearney, west, he was feared a great deal more than the

almighty."  For compactness, simplicity and vigor of expression, I will

"back" that sentence against anything in literature.  Mr. Dimsdale's

narrative is as follows.  In all places where italics occur, they are

mine:



      After the execution of the five men on the 14th of January, the

      Vigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended.  They had

      freed the country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent, and

      they determined that in the absence of the regular civil authority

      they would establish a People's Court where all offenders should be

      tried by judge and jury.  This was the nearest approach to social

      order that the circumstances permitted, and, though strict legal

      authority was wanting, yet the people were firmly determined to

      maintain its efficiency, and to enforce its decrees.  It may here be

      mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal

      ladder leading to the scaffold on which Slade perished, was the

      tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of this court, followed

      by his arrest of the Judge Alex. Davis, by authority of a presented

      Derringer, and with his own hands.



      J. A. Slade was himself, we have been informed, a Vigilante; he

      openly boasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew.  He was

      never accused, or even suspected, of either murder or robbery,

      committed in this Territory (the latter crime was never laid to his

      charge, in any place); but that he had killed several men in other

      localities was notorious, and his bad reputation in this respect was

      a most powerful argument in determining his fate, when he was

      finally arrested for the offence above mentioned.  On returning from

      Milk River he became more and more addicted to drinking, until at

      last it was a common feat for him and his friends to "take the

      town."  He and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one

      horse, galloping through the streets, shouting and yelling, firing

      revolvers, etc.  On many occasions he would ride his horse into

      stores, break up bars, toss the scales out of doors and use most

      insulting language to parties present.  Just previous to the day of

      his arrest, he had given a fearful beating to one of his followers;

      but such was his influence over them that the man wept bitterly at

      the gallows, and begged for his life with all his power.  It had

      become quite common, when Slade was on a spree, for the shop-keepers

      and citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights; being

      fearful of some outrage at his hands.  For his wanton destruction of

      goods and furniture, he was always ready to pay, when sober, if he

      had money; but there were not a few who regarded payment as small

      satisfaction for the outrage, and these men were his personal

      enemies.



      From time to time Slade received warnings from men that he well knew

      would not deceive him, of the certain end of his conduct.  There was

      not a moment, for weeks previous to his arrest, in which the public

      did not expect to hear of some bloody outrage.  The dread of his

      very name, and the presence of the armed band of hangers-on who

      followed him alone prevented a resistance which must certainly have

      ended in the instant murder or mutilation of the opposing party.



      Slade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose

      organization we have described, and had treated it with respect by

      paying one or two fines and promising to pay the rest when he had

      money; but in the transaction that occurred at this crisis, he

      forgot even this caution, and goaded by passion and the hatred of

      restraint, he sprang into the embrace of death.



      Slade had been drunk and "cutting up" all night.  He and his

      companions had made the town a perfect hell.  In the morning, J. M.

      Fox, the sheriff, met him, arrested him, took him into court and

      commenced reading a warrant that he had for his arrest, by way of

      arraignment.  He became uncontrollably furious, and seizing the

      writ, he tore it up, threw it on the ground and stamped upon it.



      The clicking of the locks of his companions' revolvers was instantly

      heard, and a crisis was expected.  The sheriff did not attempt his

      retention; but being at least as prudent as he was valiant, he

      succumbed, leaving Slade the master of the situation and the

      conqueror and ruler of the courts, law and law-makers.  This was a

      declaration of war, and was so accepted.  The Vigilance Committee

      now felt that the question of social order and the preponderance of

      the law-abiding citizens had then and there to be decided.  They

      knew the character of Slade, and they were well aware that they must

      submit to his rule without murmur, or else that he must be dealt

      with in such fashion as would prevent his being able to wreak his

      vengeance on the committee, who could never have hoped to live in

      the Territory secure from outrage or death, and who could never

      leave it without encountering his friend, whom his victory would

      have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that would have rendered

      them reckless of consequences.  The day previous he had ridden into

      Dorris's store, and on being requested to leave, he drew his

      revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him.

      Another saloon he had led his horse into, and buying a bottle of

      wine, he tried to make the animal drink it.  This was not considered

      an uncommon performance, as he had often entered saloons and

      commenced firing at the lamps, causing a wild stampede.



      A leading member of the committee met Slade, and informed him in the

      quiet, earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is

      saying: "Slade, get your horse at once, and go home, or there will

      be ---- to pay."  Slade started and took a long look, with his dark

      and piercing eyes, at the gentleman.  "What do you mean?"  said he.

      "You have no right to ask me what I mean," was the quiet reply, "get

      your horse at once, and remember what I tell you."  After a short

      pause he promised to do so, and actually got into the saddle; but,

      being still intoxicated, he began calling aloud to one after another

      of his friends, and at last seemed to have forgotten the warning he

      had received and became again uproarious, shouting the name of a

      well-known courtezan in company with those of two men whom he

      considered heads of the committee, as a sort of challenge; perhaps,

      however, as a simple act of bravado.  It seems probable that the

      intimation of personal danger he had received had not been forgotten

      entirely; though fatally for him, he took a foolish way of showing

      his remembrance of it.  He sought out Alexander Davis, the Judge of

      the Court, and drawing a cocked Derringer, he presented it at his

      head, and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own

      safety.  As the judge stood perfectly quiet, and offered no

      resistance to his captor, no further outrage followed on this score.

      Previous to this, on account of the critical state of affairs, the

      committee had met, and at last resolved to arrest him.  His

      execution had not been agreed upon, and, at that time, would have

      been negatived, most assuredly.  A messenger rode down to Nevada to

      inform the leading men of what was on hand, as it was desirable to

      show that there was a feeling of unanimity on the subject, all along

      the gulch.



      The miners turned out almost en masse, leaving their work and

      forming in solid column about six hundred strong, armed to the

      teeth, they marched up to Virginia.  The leader of the body well

      knew the temper of his men on the subject.  He spurred on ahead of

      them, and hastily calling a meeting of the executive, he told them

      plainly that the miners meant "business," and that, if they came up,

      they would not stand in the street to be shot down by Slade's

      friends; but that they would take him and hang him.  The meeting was

      small, as the Virginia men were loath to act at all.  This momentous

      announcement of the feeling of the Lower Town was made to a cluster

      of men, who were deliberation behind a wagon, at the rear of a store

      on Main street.



      The committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities.  All

      the duty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task

      before them; but they had to decide, and that quickly.  It was

      finally agreed that if the whole body of the miners were of the

      opinion that he should be hanged, that the committee left it in

      their hands to deal with him.  Off, at hot speed, rode the leader of

      the Nevada men to join his command.



      Slade had found out what was intended, and the news sobered him

      instantly.  He went into P. S. Pfouts' store, where Davis was, and

      apologized for his conduct, saying that he would take it all back.



      The head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched

      up at quick time.  Halting in front of the store, the executive

      officer of the committee stepped forward and arrested Slade, who was

      at once informed of his doom, and inquiry was made as to whether he

      had any business to settle.  Several parties spoke to him on the

      subject; but to all such inquiries he turned a deaf ear, being

      entirely absorbed in the terrifying reflections on his own awful

      position.  He never ceased his entreaties for life, and to see his

      dear wife.  The unfortunate lady referred to, between whom and Slade

      there existed a warm affection, was at this time living at their

      ranch on the Madison.  She was possessed of considerable personal

      attractions; tall, well-formed, of graceful carriage, pleasing

      manners, and was, withal, an accomplished horsewoman.



      A messenger from Slade rode at full speed to inform her of her

      husband's arrest.  In an instant she was in the saddle, and with all

      the energy that love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament

      and a strong physique, she urged her fleet charger over the twelve

      miles of rough and rocky ground that intervened between her and the

      object of her passionate devotion.



      Meanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations

      for the execution, in the valley traversed by the branch.  Beneath

      the site of Pfouts and Russell's stone building there was a corral,

      the gate-posts of which were strong and high.  Across the top was

      laid a beam, to which the rope was fastened, and a dry-goods box

      served for the platform.  To this place Slade was marched,

      surrounded by a guard, composing the best armed and most numerous

      force that has ever appeared in Montana Territory.



      The doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and

      lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the

      fatal beam.  He repeatedly exclaimed, "My God! my God! must I die?

      Oh, my dear wife!"



      On the return of the fatigue party, they encountered some friends of

      Slade, staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee,

      but who were personally attached to the condemned.  On hearing of

      his sentence, one of them, a stout-hearted man, pulled out his

      handkerchief and walked away, weeping like a child.  Slade still

      begged to see his wife, most piteously, and it seemed hard to deny

      his request; but the bloody consequences that were sure to follow

      the inevitable attempt at a rescue, that her presence and entreaties

      would have certainly incited, forbade the granting of his request.

      Several gentlemen were sent for to see him, in his last moments, one

      of whom (Judge Davis) made a short address to the people; but in

      such low tones as to be inaudible, save to a few in his immediate

      vicinity.  One of his friends, after exhausting his powers of

      entreaty, threw off his coat and declared that the prisoner could

      not be hanged until he himself was killed.  A hundred guns were

      instantly leveled at him; whereupon he turned and fled; but, being

      brought back, he was compelled to resume his coat, and to give a

      promise of future peaceable demeanor.



      Scarcely a leading man in Virginia could be found, though numbers of

      the citizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made.

      All lamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution.



      Everything being ready, the command was given, "Men, do your duty,"

      and the box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet, he died

      almost instantaneously.



      The body was cut down and carried to the Virginia Hotel, where, in a

      darkened room, it was scarcely laid out, when the unfortunate and

      bereaved companion of the deceased arrived, at headlong speed, to

      find that all was over, and that she was a widow.  Her grief and

      heart-piercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her

      attachment for her lost husband, and a considerable period elapsed

      before she could regain the command of her excited feelings.



There is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly

unaccountable--at least it looks unaccountable.  It is this.  The true

desperado is gifted with splendid courage, and yet he will take the most

infamous advantage of his enemy; armed and free, he will stand up before

a host and fight until he is shot all to pieces, and yet when he is under

the gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child.  Words are

cheap, and it is easy to call Slade a coward (all executed men who do not

"die game" are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people), and when

we read of Slade that he "had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and

lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal

beam," the disgraceful word suggests itself in a moment--yet in

frequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded Rocky Mountain

cut-throats by shooting down their comrades and leaders, and never

offering to hide or fly, Slade showed that he was a man of peerless

bravery.  No coward would dare that.  Many a notorious coward, many a

chicken-livered poltroon, coarse, brutal, degraded, has made his dying

speech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with

what looked liked the calmest fortitude, and so we are justified in

believing, from the low intellect of such a creature, that it was not

moral courage that enabled him to do it.  Then, if moral courage is not

the requisite quality, what could it have been that this stout-hearted

Slade lacked?--this bloody, desperate, kindly-mannered, urbane gentleman,

who never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would kill

them whenever or wherever he came across them next!  I think it is a

conundrum worth investigating.









CHAPTER XII.



Just beyond the breakfast-station we overtook a Mormon emigrant train of

thirty-three wagons; and tramping wearily along and driving their herd of

loose cows, were dozens of coarse-clad and sad-looking men, women and

children, who had walked as they were walking now, day after day for

eight lingering weeks, and in that time had compassed the distance our

stage had come in eight days and three hours--seven hundred and ninety-

eight miles!  They were dusty and uncombed, hatless, bonnetless and

ragged, and they did look so tired!



After breakfast, we bathed in Horse Creek, a (previously) limpid,

sparkling stream--an appreciated luxury, for it was very seldom that our

furious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind.  We

changed horses ten or twelve times in every twenty-four hours--changed

mules, rather--six mules--and did it nearly every time in four minutes.

It was lively work.  As our coach rattled up to each station six

harnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable; and in the twinkling of an

eye, almost, the old team was out, and the new one in and we off and away

again.



During the afternoon we passed Sweetwater Creek, Independence Rock,

Devil's Gate and the Devil's Gap.  The latter were wild specimens of

rugged scenery, and full of interest--we were in the heart of the Rocky

Mountains, now.  And we also passed by "Alkali" or "Soda Lake," and we

woke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the

world when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great

Salt Lake City to haul away saleratus.  He said that a few days gone by

they had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground (it was a dry

lake) to load two wagons, and that when they got these two wagons-loads

of a drug that cost them nothing, to Salt Lake, they could sell it for

twenty-five cents a pound.



In the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity, and one we had been

hearing a good deal about for a day or two, and were suffering to see.

This was what might be called a natural ice-house.  It was August, now,

and sweltering weather in the daytime, yet at one of the stations the men

could scape the soil on the hill-side under the lee of a range of

boulders, and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of ice--hard,

compactly frozen, and clear as crystal!



Toward dawn we got under way again, and presently as we sat with raised

curtains enjoying our early-morning smoke and contemplating the first

splendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain

peaks, flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit, as

if the invisible Creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted with

a smile, we hove in sight of South Pass City.  The hotel-keeper, the

postmaster, the blacksmith, the mayor, the constable, the city marshal

and the principal citizen and property holder, all came out and greeted

us cheerily, and we gave him good day.  He gave us a little Indian news,

and a little Rocky Mountain news, and we gave him some Plains information

in return.  He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up

among the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds.  South Pass City

consisted of four log cabins, one if which was unfinished, and the

gentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten

citizens of the place.  Think of hotel-keeper, postmaster, blacksmith,

mayor, constable, city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into

one person and crammed into one skin.  Bemis said he was "a perfect

Allen's revolver of dignities."  And he said that if he were to die as

postmaster, or as blacksmith, or as postmaster and blacksmith both, the

people might stand it; but if he were to die all over, it would be a

frightful loss to the community.



Two miles beyond South Pass City we saw for the first time that

mysterious marvel which all Western untraveled boys have heard of and

fully believe in, but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with

their own eyes, nevertheless--banks of snow in dead summer time.  We were

now far up toward the sky, and knew all the time that we must presently

encounter lofty summits clad in the "eternal snow" which was so common

place a matter of mention in books, and yet when I did see it glittering

in the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was August

and that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear it, I was

full as much amazed as if I never had heard of snow in August before.

Truly, "seeing is believing"--and many a man lives a long life through,

thinking he believes certain universally received and well established

things, and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by those things

once, he would discover that he did not really believe them before, but

only thought he believed them.



In a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws

of glittering snow clasping them; and with here and there, in the shade,

down the mountain side, a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger

than a lady's pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as large as a

"public square."



And now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and whirling

gayly along high above the common world.  We were perched upon the

extreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward which we

had been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing, for days and

nights together--and about us was gathered a convention of Nature's kings

that stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet high--grand old

fellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington, in the twilight.

We were in such an airy elevation above the creeping populations of the

earth, that now and then when the obstructing crags stood out of the way

it seemed that we could look around and abroad and contemplate the whole

great globe, with its dissolving views of mountains, seas and continents

stretching away through the mystery of the summer haze.



As a general thing the Pass was more suggestive of a valley than a

suspension bridge in the clouds--but it strongly suggested the latter at

one spot.  At that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple

domes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a

hidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their

bases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and look

over.  These Sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes

of cloud, which shredded away from time to time and drifted off fringed

and torn, trailing their continents of shadow after them; and catching

presently on an intercepting peak, wrapped it about and brooded there--

then shredded away again and left the purple peak, as they had left the

purple domes, downy and white with new-laid snow.  In passing, these

monstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the

spectator's head, swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his

impulse was to shrink when they came closet.  In the one place I speak

of, one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and

canyons leading down, down, and away to a vague plain with a thread in it

which was a road, and bunches of feathers in it which were trees,--a

pretty picture sleeping in the sunlight--but with a darkness stealing

over it and glooming its features  deeper and deeper under the frown of a

coming storm; and then, while no film or shadow marred the noon

brightness of his high perch, he could watch the tempest break forth down

there and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted rain

drive along the canyon-sides, and hear the thunders peal and crash and

roar.  We had this spectacle; a familiar one to many, but to us a

novelty.



We bowled along cheerily, and presently, at the very summit (though it

had been all summit to us, and all equally level, for half an hour or

more), we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and

sent it in opposite directions.  The conductor said that one of those

streams which we were looking at, was just starting on a journey westward

to the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean, through hundreds and

even thousands of miles of desert solitudes.  He said that the other was

just leaving its home among the snow-peaks on a similar journey eastward

--and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simple rivulet

it would still be plodding its patient way down the mountain sides, and

canyon-beds, and between the banks of the Yellowstone; and by and by

would join the broad Missouri and flow through unknown plains and deserts

and unvisited wildernesses; and add a long and troubled pilgrimage among

snags and wrecks and sandbars; and enter the Mississippi, touch the

wharves of St. Louis and still drift on, traversing shoals and rocky

channels, then endless chains of bottomless and ample bends, walled with

unbroken forests, then mysterious byways and secret passages among woody

islands, then the chained bends again, bordered with wide levels of

shining sugar-cane in place of the sombre forests; then by New Orleans

and still other chains of bends--and finally, after two long months of

daily and nightly harassment, excitement, enjoyment, adventure, and awful

peril of parched throats, pumps and evaporation, pass the Gulf and enter

into its rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea, never to look upon its

snow-peaks again or regret them.



I freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home, and

dropped it in the stream.  But I put no stamp on it and it was held for

postage somewhere.



On the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons, many tired

men and women, and many a disgusted sheep and cow.



In the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition I recognized

John -----.  Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky

Mountains thousands of miles from home, he was the last one I should have

looked for.  We were school-boys together and warm friends for years.

But a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had

never been renewed.  The act of which I speak was this.  I had been

accustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third

story of a building and overlooked the street.  One day this editor gave

me a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot, but

chancing to look out of the window, I saw John standing directly under it

and an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head,

which I immediately did.  I was the loser, for it spoiled the melon, and

John never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted, but now

met again under these circumstances.



We recognized each other simultaneously, and hands were grasped as warmly

as if no coldness had ever existed between us, and no allusion was made

to any.  All animosities were buried and the simple fact of meeting a

familiar face in that isolated spot so far from home, was sufficient to

make us forget all things but pleasant ones, and we parted again with

sincere "good-bye" and "God bless you" from both.



We had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Rocky Mountains for

many tedious hours--we started down them, now.  And we went spinning away

at a round rate too.



We left the snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind, and

sped away, always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long

ranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen--monuments of the huge

emigration of other days--and here and there were up-ended boards or

small piles of stones which the driver said marked the resting-place of

more precious remains.



It was the loneliest land for a grave!  A land given over to the cayote

and the raven--which is but another name for desolation and utter

solitude.  On damp, murky nights, these scattered skeletons gave forth a

soft, hideous glow, like very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague

desert.  It was because of the phosphorus in the bones.  But no

scientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted

by one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it.



At midnight it began to rain, and I never saw anything like it--indeed, I

did not even see this, for it was too dark.  We fastened down the

curtains and even caulked them with clothing, but the rain streamed in in

twenty places, nothwithstanding.  There was no escape.  If one moved his

feet out of a stream, he brought his body under one; and if he moved his

body he caught one somewhere else.  If he struggled out of the drenched

blankets and sat up, he was bound to get one down the back of his neck.

Meantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping gullies in it,

for the driver could not see an inch before his face nor keep the road,

and the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses

still.  With the first abatement the conductor turned out with lanterns

to look for the road, and the first dash he made was into a chasm about

fourteen feet deep, his lantern following like a meteor.  As soon as he

touched bottom he sang out frantically:



"Don't come here!"



To which the driver, who was looking over the precipice where he had

disappeared, replied, with an injured air: "Think I'm a dam fool?"



The conductor was more than an hour finding the road--a matter which

showed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking.

He traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of danger, in two

places.  I have always been glad that we were not killed that night.

I do not know any particular reason, but I have always been glad.

In the morning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green River, a fine, large,

limpid stream--stuck in it with the water just up to the top of our mail-

bed, and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep

bank.  But it was nice cool water, and besides it could not find any

fresh place on us to wet.



At the Green River station we had breakfast--hot biscuits, fresh antelope

steaks, and coffee--the only decent meal we tasted between the United

States and Great Salt Lake City, and the only one we were ever really

thankful for.



Think of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it,

to leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a shot-

tower after all these years have gone by!



At five P.M.  we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles

from the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.

Joseph.  Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met

sixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd.  The day before, they had

fired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed

gathered together for no good purpose.  In the fight that had ensued,

four Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but

nobody killed.  This looked like business.  We had a notion to get out

and join the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four

hundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.



Echo Canyon is twenty miles long.  It was like a long, smooth, narrow

street, with a gradual descending grade, and shut in by enormous

perpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate, four hundred feet high in

many places, and turreted like mediaeval castles.  This was the most

faultless piece of road in the mountains, and the driver said he would

"let his team out."  He did, and if the Pacific express trains whiz

through there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach, I envy

the passengers the exhilaration of it.  We fairly seemed to pick up our

wheels and fly--and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything

and held in solution!  I am not given to exaggeration, and when I say a

thing I mean it.



However, time presses.  At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit

of Big Mountain, fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, when all the world

was glorified with the setting sun, and the most stupendous panorama of

mountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight.  We looked out upon

this sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow!  Even

the overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed!



Half an hour or an hour later, we changed horses, and took supper with a

Mormon "Destroying Angel."



"Destroying Angels," as I understand it, are Latter-Day Saints who are

set apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious

citizens.  I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and

the dark and bloody deeds they had done, and when I entered this one's

house I had my shudder all ready.  But alas for all our romances, he was

nothing but a loud, profane, offensive, old blackguard!  He was murderous

enough, possibly, to fill the bill of a Destroyer, but would you have any

kind of an Angel devoid of dignity?  Could you abide an Angel in an

unclean shirt and no suspenders?  Could you respect an Angel with a

horse-laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer?



There were other blackguards present--comrades of this one.  And there

was one person that looked like a gentleman--Heber C. Kimball's son, tall

and well made, and thirty years old, perhaps.  A lot of slatternly women

flitted hither and thither in a hurry, with coffee-pots, plates of bread,

and other appurtenances to supper, and these were said to be the wives of

the Angel--or some of them, at least.  And of course they were; for if

they had been hired "help" they would not have let an angel from above

storm and swear at them as he did, let alone one from the place this one

hailed from.



This was our first experience of the western "peculiar institution," and

it was not very prepossessing.  We did not tarry long to observe it, but

hurried on to the home of the Latter-Day Saints, the stronghold of the

prophets, the capital of the only absolute monarch in America--Great Salt

Lake City.  As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake

House and unpacked our baggage.









CHAPTER XIII.



We had a fine supper, of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetables--a

great variety and as great abundance.  We walked about the streets some,

afterward, and glanced in at shops and stores; and there was fascination

in surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a Mormon.

This was fairy-land to us, to all intents and purposes--a land of

enchantment, and goblins, and awful mystery.  We felt a curiosity to ask

every child how many mothers it had, and if it could tell them apart; and

we experienced a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and shut

as we passed, disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and

shoulders--for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a Mormon

family in all its comprehensive ampleness, disposed in the customary

concentric rings of its home circle.



By and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us to other

"Gentiles," and we spent a sociable hour with them.  "Gentiles" are

people who are not Mormons.  Our fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of

himself, during this part of the evening, and did not make an

overpowering success of it, either, for he came into our room in the

hotel about eleven o'clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely,

disjointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a

ragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it.

This, together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a

chair, and his vest on the floor on the other side, and piling his pants

on the floor just in front of the same chair, and then comtemplating the

general result with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it "too

many for him" and going to bed with his boots on, led us to fear that

something he had eaten had not agreed with him.



But we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking.  It was

the exclusively Mormon refresher, "valley tan."



Valley tan (or, at least, one form of valley tan) is a kind of whisky,

or first cousin to it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in

Utah.  Tradition says it is made of (imported) fire and brimstone.  If I

remember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom

by Brigham Young, and no private drinking permitted among the faithful,

except they confined themselves to "valley tan."



Next day we strolled about everywhere through the broad, straight, level

streets, and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen

thousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it; and no visible

drunkards or noisy people; a limpid stream rippling and dancing through

every street in place of a filthy gutter; block after block of trim

dwellings, built of "frame" and sunburned brick--a great thriving orchard

and garden behind every one of them, apparently--branches from the street

stream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees--and a

grand general air of neatness, repair, thrift and comfort, around and

about and over the whole.  And everywhere were workshops, factories, and

all manner of industries; and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen

wherever one looked; and in one's ears was the ceaseless clink of

hammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and fly-wheels.



The armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute bears

holding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the

pertinent remark, "UNITED, WE STAND--(hic!)--DIVIDED, WE FALL."  It was

always too figurative for the author of this book.  But the Mormon crest

was easy.  And it was simple, unostentatious, and fitted like a glove.

It was a representation of a GOLDEN BEEHIVE, with the bees all at work!



The city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State of

Connecticut, and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall

of mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds, and whose

shoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long.



Seen from one of these dizzy heights, twelve or fifteen miles off, Great

Salt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a

child's toy-village reposing under the majestic protection of the Chinese

wall.



On some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been raining every

day for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in the city.  And on hot

days in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and

growling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious

snow-storm going on in the mountains.  They could enjoy it at a distance,

at those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their streets,

or anywhere near them.



Salt Lake City was healthy--an extremely healthy city.



They declared there was only one physician in the place and he was

arrested every week regularly and held to answer under the vagrant act

for having "no visible means of support."  They always give you a good

substantial article of truth in Salt Lake, and good measure and good

weight, too. [Very often, if you wished to weigh one of their airiest

little commonplace statements you would want the hay scales.]



We desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American "Dead Sea," the

great Salt Lake--seventeen miles, horseback, from the city--for we had

dreamed about it, and thought about it, and talked about it, and yearned

to see it, all the first part of our trip; but now when it was only arm's

length away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest.  And

so we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day--and that was

the last we ever thought of it.  We dined with some hospitable Gentiles;

and visited the foundation of the prodigious temple; and talked long with

that shrewd Connecticut Yankee, Heber C. Kimball (since deceased), a

saint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce.



We saw the "Tithing-House," and the "Lion House," and I do not know or

remember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds

and curious names.  We flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour,

and picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining

nonsense, and went to bed at night satisfied.



The second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street (since deceased)

and put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king.

He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old

gentleman of fifty-five or sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that

probably belonged there.  He was very simply dressed and was just taking

off a straw hat as we entered.  He talked about Utah, and the Indians,

and Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our

secretary and certain government officials who came with us.  But he

never paid any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts

to "draw him out" on federal politics and his high handed attitude toward

Congress.  I thought some of the things I said were rather fine.  But he

merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have

seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling

with her tail.



By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the end,

hot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage.

But he was calm.  His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as

sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook.  When the

audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his

hand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my

brother:



"Ah--your child, I presume?  Boy, or girl?"









CHAPTER XIV.



Mr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and considering

that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited

mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with

his wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as

possible.  He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the

road-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those

exhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from water to water, in

one or two of them.  Mr. Street's contract was a vast work, every way one

looked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words "eight hundred

miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts" mean, one must go over the

ground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary

reality to the reader.  And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty

turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all.

Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great

undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to

make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles

overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the

notion, and drove home and went about their customary business!  They

were under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything

for that.  They said they would "admire" to see a "Gentile" force a

Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah!  And they made themselves

very merry over the matter.  Street said--for it was he that told us

these things:



"I was in dismay.  I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a

given time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin.  It was an

astounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I

was entirely nonplussed.  I am a business man--have always been a

business man--do not know anything but business--and so you can imagine

how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country

where written contracts were worthless!--that main security, that sheet-

anchor, that absolute necessity, of business.  My confidence left me.

There was no use in making new contracts--that was plain.  I talked with

first one prominent citizen and then another.  They all sympathized with

me, first rate, but they did not know how to help me.  But at last a

Gentile said, 'Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any

good.'  I did not think much of the idea, for if the law could not help

me, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with

either making the laws or executing them?  He might be a very good

patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something

sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred

refractory, half-civilized sub-contractors.  But what was a man to do?

I thought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be

able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went

straight to him and laid the whole case before him.  He said very little,

but he showed strong interest all the way through.  He examined all the

papers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch, either

in the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the thread

and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result.

Then he made a list of the contractors' names.  Finally he said:



"'Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain.  These contracts are strictly

and legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified.  These men

manifestly entered into them with their eyes open.  I see no fault or

flaw anywhere.'



"Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and

said: 'Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these

men here at such-and-such an hour.'



"They were there, to the minute.  So was I.  Mr. Young asked them a

number of questions, and their answers made my statement good.  Then he

said to them:



"'You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own

free will and accord?'



"'Yes.'



"'Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!  Go!'



"And they did go, too!  They are strung across the deserts now, working

like bees.  And I never hear a word out of them.



"There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here,

shipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican

form of government--but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute

monarchy and Brigham Young is king!"



Mr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story.  I knew him well

during several years afterward in San Francisco.



Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we

had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of

polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to

calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter.



I had the will to do it.  With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I

was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here--until

I saw the Mormon women.  Then I was touched.  My heart was wiser than my

head.  It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically "homely"

creatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I

said, "No--the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian

charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their

harsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of

open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered

in his presence and worship in silence."



      [For a brief sketch of Mormon history, and the noted Mountain Meadow

      massacre, see Appendices A and B. ]









CHAPTER XV.



It is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about

assassinations of intractable Gentiles.  I cannot easily conceive of

anything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a

Gentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped

in among the pleading and defenceless "Morisites" and shot them down, men

and women, like so many dogs.  And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel,

shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt.

And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing.  And how

heedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or

polygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at

daylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley,

contentedly waiting for the hearse.



And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these

Gentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder,

or a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her,

marries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her

mother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather,

and then comes back hungry and asks for more.  And how the pert young

thing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable

grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's

esteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not.  And how this

dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother

and daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother

in rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because

their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and

the more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in

the world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say

anything about that.



According to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young's harem

contains twenty or thirty wives.  They said that some of them had grown

old and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and cared

for in the henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named.  Along

with each wife were her children--fifty altogether.  The house was

perfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still.  They all took

their meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was

pronounced to be.  None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner

with Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have

enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House.  He gave a preposterous

account of the "calling of the roll," and other preliminaries, and the

carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in.  But he embellished

rather too much.  He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings

of certain of his "two-year-olds," observing with some pride that for

many years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of

the Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the

pets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child.



He searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide

which one it was.  Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:



"I thought I would know the little cub again but I don't."  Mr. Johnson

said further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad thing--

"because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be

blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride."  And Mr.

Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in

private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin,

remarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to

No. 6, and she, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on

without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it.  Mr. Young

reminded her that there was a stranger present.  Mrs. Young said that if

the state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger,

he could find room outside.  Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she

went away.  But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and

demanded a breast-pin.  Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young

cut him short.  She said No. 6 had got one, and No. 11 was promised one,

and it was "no use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew

her rights."  He gave his promise, and she went.  And presently three

Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of

tears, abuse, and entreaty.  They had heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and

No. 14.  Three more breast-pins were promised.  They were hardly gone

when nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest

burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest.  Nine

breast-pins were promised, and the weird sisters filed out again.  And in

came eleven more, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth.  Eleven

promised breast-pins purchased peace once more.



"That is a specimen," said Mr. Young.  "You see how it is.  You see what

a life I lead.  A man can't be wise all the time.  In a heedless moment I

gave my darling No. 6--excuse my calling her thus, as her other name has

escaped me for the moment--a breast-pin.  It was only worth twenty-five

dollars--that is, apparently that was its whole cost--but its ultimate

cost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more.  You yourself have seen

it climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars--and alas, even that is not

the end!  For I have wives all over this Territory of Utah.  I have

dozens of wives whose numbers, even, I do not know without looking in the

family Bible.  They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and

valleys of my realm.  And mark you, every solitary one of them will hear

of this wretched breast pin, and every last one of them will have one or

die.  No. 6's breast pin will cost me twenty-five hundred dollars before

I see the end of it.  And these creatures will compare these pins

together, and if one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be

thrown on my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in

the family.  Sir, you probably did not know it, but all the time you were

present with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant

servitors of mine.  If you had offered to give a child a dime, or a stick

of candy, or any trifle of the kind, you would have been snatched out of

the house instantly, provided it could be done before your gift left your

hand.  Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an

exactly similar gift to all my children--and knowing by experience the

importance of the thing, I would have stood by and seen to it myself that

you did it, and did it thoroughly.  Once a gentleman gave one of my

children a tin whistle--a veritable invention of Satan, sir, and one

which I have an unspeakable horror of, and so would you if you had eighty

or ninety children in your house.  But the deed was done--the man

escaped.  I knew what the result was going to be, and I thirsted for

vengeance.  I ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels, and they hunted

the man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains.  But they never

caught him.  I am not cruel, sir--I am not vindictive except when sorely

outraged--but if I had caught him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I would

have locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death.

By the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt (whom God assail!) there

was never anything on this earth like it!  I knew who gave the whistle to

the child, but I could, not make those jealous mothers believe me.  They

believed I did it, and the result was just what any man of reflection

could have foreseen: I had to order a hundred and ten whistles--I think

we had a hundred and ten children in the house then, but some of them are

off at college now--I had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking

things, and I wish I may never speak another word if we didn't have to

talk on our fingers entirely, from that time forth until the children got

tired of the whistles.  And if ever another man gives a whistle to a

child of mine and I get my hands on him, I will hang him higher than

Haman!  That is the word with the bark on it!  Shade of Nephi!  You don't

know anything about married life.  I am rich, and everybody knows it.  I

am benevolent, and everybody takes advantage of it.  I have a strong

fatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me.



"Every time a woman wants to do well by her darling, she puzzles her brain

to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands.  Why, sir, a

woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of

complexion (and so had the woman), and swore that the child was mine and

she my wife--that I had married her at such-and-such a time in such-and-

such a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I could not

remember her name.  Well, sir, she called my attention to the fact that

the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble me--a common

thing in the Territory--and, to cut the story short, I put it in my

nursery, and she left.  And by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when they came to

wash the paint off that child it was an Injun!  Bless my soul, you don't

know anything about married life.  It is a perfect dog's life, sir--a

perfect dog's life.  You can't economize.  It isn't possible.  I have

tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all occasions.  But it is of

no use.  First you'll marry a combination of calico and consumption

that's as thin as a rail, and next you'll get a creature that's nothing

more than the dropsy in disguise, and then you've got to eke out that

bridal dress with an old balloon.  That is the way it goes.  And think of

the wash-bill--(excuse these tears)--nine hundred and eighty-four pieces

a week!  No, sir, there is no such a thing as economy in a family like

mine.  Why, just the one item of cradles--think of it!  And vermifuge!

Soothing syrup!  Teething rings!  And 'papa's watches' for the babies to

play with!  And things to scratch the furniture with!  And lucifer

matches for them to eat, and pieces of glass to cut themselves with!

The item of glass alone would support your family, I venture to say, sir.

Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can, I still can't get ahead as fast as I

feel I ought to, with my opportunities.  Bless you, sir, at a time when I

had seventy-two wives in this house, I groaned under the pressure of

keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads when the

money ought to have been out at interest; and I just sold out the whole

stock, sir, at a sacrifice, and built a bedstead seven feet long and

ninety-six feet wide.  But it was a failure, sir.  I could not sleep.

It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once.

The roar was deafening.  And then the danger of it!  That was what I was

looking at.  They would all draw in their breath at once, and you could

actually see the walls of the house suck in--and then they would all

exhale their breath at once, and you could see the walls swell out, and

strain, and hear the rafters crack, and the shingles grind together.

My friend, take an old man's advice, and don't encumber yourself with a

large family--mind, I tell you, don't do it.  In a small family, and in a

small family only, you will find that comfort and that peace of mind

which are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford

us, and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth, and no

acquisition of fame, power, and greatness can ever compensate us.

Take my word for it, ten or eleven wives is all you need--never go over

it."



Some instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as being unreliable.

And yet he was a very entertaining person, and I doubt if some of the

information he gave us could have been acquired from any other source.

He was a pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons.









CHAPTER XVI.



All men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the "elect" have

seen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it.  I brought away a

copy from Salt Lake.  The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a

pretentious affair, and yet so "slow," so sleepy; such an insipid mess of

inspiration.  It is chloroform in print.  If Joseph Smith composed this

book, the act was a miracle--keeping awake while he did it was, at any

rate.  If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain

ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he

found under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of

translating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.



The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the

Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New

Testament.  The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint,

old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James's translation of the

Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel--half modern glibness, and half

ancient simplicity and gravity.  The latter is awkward and constrained;

the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast.  Whenever he found his

speech growing too modern--which was about every sentence or two--he

ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as "exceeding sore," "and it came

to pass," etc., and made things satisfactory again.  "And it came to

pass" was his pet.  If he had left that out, his Bible would have been

only a pamphlet.



The title-page reads as follows:



      THE BOOK OF MORMON: AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON, UPON

      PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI.



      Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,

      and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites, who are a

      remnant of the House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written

      by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of

      revelation.  Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that

      they might not be destroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of

      God unto the interpretation thereof; sealed by the hand of Moroni,

      and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by the way of

      Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift of God.  An

      abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also; which is a record of

      the people of Jared; who were scattered at the time the Lord

      confounded the language of the people when they were building a

      tower to get to Heaven.



"Hid up" is good.  And so is "wherefore"--though why "wherefore"?  Any

other word would have answered as well--though--in truth it would not

have sounded so Scriptural.



Next comes:



      THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES.

      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto

      whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the

      Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which

      contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and

      also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of

      Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we

      also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of

      God, for His voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a

      surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we have seen

      the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown

      unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we declare with

      words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and

      he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the

      plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the

      grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld

      and bear record that these things are true; and it is marvellous in

      our eyes; nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded us that we

      should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the

      commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things.  And we know

      that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the

      blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of

      Christ, and shall dwell with Him eternally in the heavens.  And the

      honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which

      is one God.  Amen.

                          OLIVER COWDERY,

                          DAVID WHITMER,

                          MARTIN HARRIS.



Some people have to have a world of evidence before they can come

anywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything; but for me, when a

man tells me that he has "seen the engravings which are upon the plates,"

and not only that, but an angel was there at the time, and saw him see

them, and probably took his receipt for it, I am very far on the road to

conviction, no matter whether I ever heard of that man before or not, and

even if I do not know the name of the angel, or his nationality either.



Next is this:



      AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES.

      Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people unto

      whom this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jr., the translator of

      this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken,

      which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the

      said Smith has translated, we did handle with our hands; and we also

      saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of

      ancient work, and of curious workmanship.  And this we bear record

      with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for

      we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith

      has got the plates of which we have spoken.  And we give our names

      unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen;

      and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

                          CHRISTIAN WHITMER,

                          JACOB WHITMER,

                          PETER WHITMER, JR.,

                          JOHN WHITMER,

                          HIRAM PAGE,

                          JOSEPH SMITH, SR.,

                          HYRUM SMITH,

                          SAMUEL H.  SMITH.



And when I am far on the road to conviction, and eight men, be they

grammatical or otherwise, come forward and tell me that they have seen

the plates too; and not only seen those plates but "hefted" them, I am

convinced.  I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire

Whitmer family had testified.



The Mormon Bible consists of fifteen "books"--being the books of Jacob,

Enos, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Zeniff, Alma, Helaman, Ether, Moroni, two

"books" of Mormon, and three of Nephi.



In the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Testament, which

gives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem of the "children of Lehi";

and it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness, during

eight years, and their supernatural protection by one of their number, a

party by the name of Nephi.  They finally reached the land of

"Bountiful," and camped by the sea.  After they had remained there "for

the space of many days"--which is more Scriptural than definite--Nephi

was commanded from on high to build a ship wherein to "carry the people

across the waters."  He travestied Noah's ark--but he obeyed orders in

the matter of the plan.  He finished the ship in a single day, while his

brethren stood by and made fun of it--and of him, too--"saying, our

brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship."  They did

not wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe or nation sailed the

next day.  Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out, and is revealed by

outspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness--they all got on a spree!

They, "and also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch

that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness;

yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness."



Nephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings; but they tied him neck

and heels, and went on with their lark.  But observe how Nephi the

prophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers:



      And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I

      could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord,

      did cease to work; wherefore, they knew not whither they should

      steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a

      great and terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters

      for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened

      exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless

      they did not loose me.  And on the fourth day, which we had been

      driven back, the tempest began to be exceeding sore.  And it came to

      pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea.



Then they untied him.



      And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the

      compass, and it did work whither I desired it.  And it came to pass

      that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed, the winds did

      cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.



Equipped with their compass, these ancients appear to have had the

advantage of Noah.



Their voyage was toward a "promised land"--the only name they give it.

They reached it in safety.



Polygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion, and was added by

Brigham Young after Joseph Smith's death.  Before that, it was regarded

as an "abomination."  This verse from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter

II. of the book of Jacob:



      For behold, thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in

      iniquity; they understand not the Scriptures; for they seek to

      excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things

      which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.  Behold,

      David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing

      was abominable before me, saith the Lord; wherefore, thus saith the

      Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by

      the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous

      branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.  Wherefore, I the Lord

      God, will no suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.



However, the project failed--or at least the modern Mormon end of it--for

Brigham "suffers" it.  This verse is from the same chapter:



      Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their

      filthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins, are

      more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment

      of the Lord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should

      have, save it were one wife; and concubines they should have none.



The following verse (from Chapter IX. of the Book of Nephi) appears to

contain information not familiar to everybody:



      And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven,

      the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his

      children, and did return to his own home.



      And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was

      gathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised

      from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name

      was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen,

      and Kumenenhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah,

      and Isaiah; now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had

      chosen.



In order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and

picturesqueness (as seen by these Mormon twelve) accompanied on of the

tenderest episodes in the life of our Saviour than other eyes seem to

have been aware of, I quote the following from the same "book"--Nephi:



      And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.

      And they arose from the earth, and He said unto them, Blessed are ye

      because of your faith.  And now behold, My joy is full.  And when He

      had said these words, He wept, and the multitude bear record of it,

      and He took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and

      prayed unto the Father for them.  And when He had done this He wept

      again, and He spake unto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold

      your little ones.  And as they looked to behold, they cast their

      eyes toward heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw

      angels descending out of heaven as it were, in the midst of fire;

      and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they

      were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto

      them, and the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they

      know that their record is true, for they all of them did see and

      hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two

      thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women,

      and children.



And what else would they be likely to consist of?



The Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of if "history," much of

it relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has

possibly never heard of; and who inhabited a country which is not set

down in the geography.  These was a King with the remarkable name of

Coriantumr,^^ and he warred with Shared, and Lib, and Shiz, and others,

in the "plains of Heshlon"; and the "valley of Gilgal"; and the

"wilderness of Akish"; and the "land of Moran"; and the "plains of

Agosh"; and "Ogath," and "Ramah," and the "land of Corihor," and the

"hill Comnor," by "the waters of Ripliancum," etc., etc., etc.  "And it

came to pass," after a deal of fighting, that Coriantumr, upon making

calculation of his losses, found that "there had been slain two millions

of mighty men, and also their wives and their children"--say 5,000,000 or

6,000,000 in all--"and he began to sorrow in his heart."  Unquestionably

it was time.  So he wrote to Shiz, asking a cessation of hostilities, and

offering to give up his kingdom to save his people.  Shiz declined,

except upon condition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head

off first--a thing which Coriantumr would not do.  Then there was more

fighting for a season; then four years were devoted to gathering the

forces for a final struggle--after which ensued a battle, which, I take

it, is the most remarkable set forth in history,--except, perhaps, that

of the Kilkenny cats, which it resembles in some respects.  This is the

account of the gathering and the battle:



      7.  And it came to pass that they did gather together all the

      people, upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save

      it was Ether.  And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the

      doings of the people; and he beheld that the people who were for

      Coriantumr, were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and

      the people who were for Shiz, were gathered together to the army of

      Shiz; wherefore they were for the space of four years gathering

      together the people, that they might get all who were upon the face

      of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it

      was possible that they could receive.  And it came to pass that when

      they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he

      would, with their wives and their children; both men, women, and

      children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and

      breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner

      of war, they did march forth one against another, to battle; and

      they fought all that day, and conquered not.  And it came to pass

      that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps;

      and after they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling

      and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so

      great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did

      rend the air exceedingly.  And it came to pass that on the morrow

      they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day;

      nevertheless they conquered not, and when the night came again, they

      did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their

      mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.



      8.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto

      Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he

      would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.  But

      behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and

      Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were

      given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of

      their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again

      to battle.  And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and

      when the night came they slept upon their swords; and on the morrow

      they fought even until the night came; and when the night came they

      were drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and

      they slept again upon their swords; and on the morrow they fought

      again; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save

      it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr, and sixty and

      nine of the people of Shiz.  And it came to pass that they slept

      upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again,

      and they contended in their mights with their swords, and with their

      shields, all that day; and when the night came there were thirty and

      two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of

      Coriantumr.



      9.  And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for

      death on the morrow.  And they were large and mighty men, as to the

      strength of men.  And it came to pass that they fought for the space

      of three hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.  And it

      came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient

      strength, that they could walk, they were about to flee for their

      lives, but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in his

      wrath that he would slay Coriantumr, or he would perish by the

      sword: wherefore he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did

      overtake them; and they fought again with the sword.  And it came to

      pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were

      Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with loss of blood.

      And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword,

      that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.  And it came

      to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz

      raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for

      breath, he died.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the

      earth, and became as if he had no life.  And the Lord spake unto

      Ether, and said unto him, go forth.  And he went forth, and beheld

      that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished

      his record; and the hundredth part I have not written.



It seems a pity he did not finish, for after all his dreary former

chapters of commonplace, he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming

interesting.



The Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read, but there is

nothing vicious in its teachings.  Its code of morals is unobjectionable-

-it is "smouched" [Milton] from the New Testament and no credit given.









CHAPTER XVII.



At the end of our two days' sojourn, we left Great Salt Lake City hearty

and well fed and happy--physically superb but not so very much wiser, as

regards the "Mormon question," than we were when we arrived, perhaps.

We had a deal more "information" than we had before, of course, but we

did not know what portion of it was reliable and what was not--for it all

came from acquaintances of a day--strangers, strictly speaking.  We were

told, for instance, that the dreadful "Mountain Meadows Massacre" was the

work of the Indians entirely, and that the Gentiles had meanly tried to

fasten it upon the Mormons; we were told, likewise, that the Indians were

to blame, partly, and partly the Mormons; and we were told, likewise, and

just as positively, that the Mormons were almost if not wholly and

completely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless butchery.

We got the story in all these different shapes, but it was not till

several years afterward that Mrs. Waite's book, "The Mormon Prophet,"

came out with Judge Cradlebaugh's trial of the accused parties in it and

revealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that

the Mormons were the assassins.  All our "information" had three sides to

it, and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the "Mormon question"

in two days.  Still I have seen newspaper correspondents do it in one.



I left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things

existed there--and sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a

state of things existed there at all or not.  But presently I remembered

with a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three

trivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two days

were not wholly lost.  For instance, we had learned that we were at last

in a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.



The high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and

bewildering distances of freightage.  In the east, in those days, the

smallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the smallest

purchasable quantity of any commodity.  West of Cincinnati the smallest

coin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller quantity of an

article could be bought than "five cents' worth."  In Overland City the

lowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece; but in Salt Lake there did

not seem to be any money in circulation smaller than a quarter, or any

smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twenty-five cents'

worth.  We had always been used to half dimes and "five cents' worth" as

the minimum of financial negotiations; but in Salt Lake if one wanted a

cigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk pipe, it was a quarter; if

he wanted a peach, or a candle, or a newspaper, or a shave, or a little

Gentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him

from having the toothache, twenty-five cents was the price, every time.

When we looked at the shot-bag of silver, now and then, we seemed to be

wasting our substance in riotous living, but if we referred to the

expense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the

kind.



But people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and fond

and vain of both--it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that

is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one's toleration.  After

a month's acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum, the average

human being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable

five-cent days.  How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in gaudy Nevada,

every time I thought of my first financial experience in Salt Lake.

It was on this wise (which is a favorite expression of great authors, and

a very neat one, too, but I never hear anybody say on this wise when they

are talking).  A young half-breed with a complexion like a yellow-jacket

asked me if I would have my boots blacked.  It was at the Salt Lake House

the morning after we arrived.  I said yes, and he blacked them.  Then I

handed him a silver five-cent piece, with the benevolent air of a person

who is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty and suffering.  The

yellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be suppressed emotion, and

laid it reverently down in the middle of his broad hand.  Then he began

to contemplate it, much as a philosopher contemplates a gnat's ear in the

ample field of his microscope.  Several mountaineers, teamsters, stage-

drivers, etc., drew near and dropped into the tableau and fell to

surveying the money with that attractive indifference to formality which

is noticeable in the hardy pioneer.  Presently the yellow-jacket handed

the half dime back to me and told me I ought to keep my money in my

pocket-book instead of in my soul, and then I wouldn't get it cramped and

shriveled up so!



What a roar of vulgar laughter there was!  I destroyed the mongrel

reptile on the spot, but I smiled and smiled all the time I was detaching

his scalp, for the remark he made was good for an "Injun."



Yes, we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without

letting the inward shudder appear on the surface--for even already we had

overheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers, conductors,

and hostlers, and finally among citizens of Salt Lake, until we were well

aware that these superior beings despised "emigrants."  We permitted no

tell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances, for we wanted to seem

pioneers, or Mormons, half-breeds, teamsters, stage-drivers, Mountain

Meadow assassins--anything in the world that the plains and Utah

respected and admired--but we were wretchedly ashamed of being

"emigrants," and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not

swear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way.



And many a time in Nevada, afterwards, we had occasion to remember with

humiliation that we were "emigrants," and consequently a low and inferior

sort of creatures.  Perhaps the reader has visited Utah, Nevada, or

California, even in these latter days, and while communing with himself

upon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he considers

"the world," has had his wings clipped by finding that he is the one to

be pitied, and that there are entire populations around him ready and

willing to do it for him--yea, who are complacently doing it for him

already, wherever he steps his foot.



Poor thing, they are making fun of his hat; and the cut of his New York

coat; and his conscientiousness about his grammar; and his feeble

profanity; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores, shafts,

tunnels, and other things which he never saw before, and never felt

enough interest in to read about.  And all the time that he is thinking

what a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country, that lonely land,

the citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting

compassion because he is an "emigrant" instead of that proudest and

blessedest creature that exists on all the earth, a "FORTY-NINER."



The accustomed coach life began again, now, and by midnight it almost

seemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks

at all.  We had made one alteration, however.  We had provided enough

bread, boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred

miles of staging we had still to do.



And it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate the

majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and eat

ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled alternately

in rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets.  Nothing helps scenery

like ham and eggs.  Ham and eggs, and after these a pipe--an old, rank,

delicious pipe--ham and eggs and scenery, a "down grade," a flying coach,

a fragrant pipe and a contented heart--these make happiness.  It is what

all the ages have struggled for.









CHAPTER XVIII.



At eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been

the important military station of "Camp Floyd," some forty-five or fifty

miles from Salt Lake City.  At four P.M.  we had doubled our distance and

were ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake.  And now we entered upon

one of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the

diffused and diluted horrors of Sahara--an "alkali" desert.  For sixty-

eight miles there was but one break in it.  I do not remember that this

was really a break; indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a

watering depot in the midst of the stretch of sixty-eight miles.  If my

memory serves me, there was no well or spring at this place, but the

water was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the

desert.  There was a stage station there.  It was forty-five miles from

the beginning of the desert, and twenty-three from the end of it.



We plowed and dragged and groped along, the whole live-long night, and at

the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the forty-five-

mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the imported

water was.  The sun was just rising.  It was easy enough to cross a

desert in the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to reflect,

in the morning, that we in actual person had encountered an absolute

desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence of the

ignorant thenceforward.  And it was pleasant also to reflect that this

was not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one, the

metropolis itself, as you may say.  All this was very well and very

comfortable and satisfactory--but now we were to cross a desert in

daylight.  This was fine--novel--romantic--dramatically adventurous--

this, indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for!  We would write

home all about it.



This enthusiasm, this stern thirst for adventure, wilted under the sultry

August sun and did not last above one hour.  One poor little hour--and

then we were ashamed that we had "gushed" so.  The poetry was all in the

anticipation--there is none in the reality.  Imagine a vast, waveless

ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn waste tufted

with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude

that belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like a bug through

the midst of this shoreless level, and sending up tumbled volumes of dust

as if it were a bug that went by steam; imagine this aching monotony of

toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the shore still as far

away as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach and passengers so

deeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color; imagine

ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations

on boughs and bushes.  This is the reality of it.



The sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the

perspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a

sign of it finds its way to the surface--it is absorbed before it gets

there; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a

merciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a

living creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank

level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a

sound--not a sigh--not a whisper--not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or

distant pipe of bird--not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless

people that dead air.  And so the occasional sneezing of the resting

mules, and the champing of the bits, grate harshly on the grim stillness,

not dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one feel more

lonesome and forsaken than before.



The mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would make

at stated intervals a "spurt," and drag the coach a hundred or may be two

hundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back,

enveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem

afloat in a fog.  Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and bit-

champing.  Then another "spurt" of a hundred yards and another rest at

the end of it.  All day long we kept this up, without water for the mules

and without ever changing the team.  At least we kept it up ten hours,

which, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali desert.

It was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon.  And it was so

hot! and so close! and our water canteens went dry in the middle of the

day and we got so thirsty!  It was so stupid and tiresome and dull! and

the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel

deliberation!  It was so trying to give one's watch a good long

undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling

away the time and not trying to get ahead any!  The alkali dust cut

through our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the delicate

membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding--and truly and

seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and left the

desert trip nothing but a harsh reality--a thirsty, sweltering, longing,

hateful reality!



Two miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours--that was what we

accomplished.  It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a

snail-pace as that, when we had been used to making eight and ten miles

an hour.  When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert,

we were glad, for the first time, that the dictionary was along, because

we never could have found language to tell how glad we were, in any sort

of dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it.  But there could

not have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language

sufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three

mile pull.  To try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were,

would be to "gild refined gold or paint the lily."



Somehow, now that it is there, the quotation does not seem to fit--but no

matter, let it stay, anyhow.  I think it is a graceful and attractive

thing, and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where

it would fit, but could not succeed.  These efforts have kept my mind

distracted and ill at ease, and made my narrative seem broken and

disjointed, in places.  Under these circumstances it seems to me best to

leave it in, as above, since this will afford at least a temporary

respite from the wear and tear of trying to "lead up" to this really apt

and beautiful quotation.









CHAPTER XIX.



On the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the

entrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake.

It was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any habitation

of white men, except the stage stations, that we came across the

wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing.  I

refer to the Goshoot Indians.  From what we could see and all we could

learn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger

Indians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our continent;

inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the Hottentots, and

actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa.  Indeed, I

have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood's "Uncivilized Races

of Men" clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to

take rank with the Goshoots.  I find but one people fairly open to that

shameful verdict.  It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of South Africa.  Such

of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations,

were small, lean, "scrawny" creatures; in complexion a dull black like

the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which

they had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and even

generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, sneaking,

treacherous looking race; taking note of everything, covertly, like all

the other "Noble Red Men" that we (do not) read about, and betraying no

sign in their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and tireless,

like all other Indians; prideless beggars--for if the beggar instinct

were left out of an Indian he would not "go," any more than a clock

without a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet never refusing

anything that a hog would eat, though often eating what a hog would

decline; hunters, but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat

jack-ass rabbits,  crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from

the buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common

Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to

emotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of

almost naked black children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at

all, and have no villages, and no gatherings together into strictly

defined tribal communities--a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on

a bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the

most rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can

exhibit.



The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same

gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever animal--Adam the

Darwinians trace them to.



One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and yet

they used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months

and then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and burn

down the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out.

And once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District

Judge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first

volley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains,

wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver.  The latter was

full of pluck, and so was his passenger.  At the driver's call Judge Mott

swung himself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team,

and away they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a

hurtling storm of missiles.  The stricken driver had sunk down on the

boot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he

would manage to keep hold of them until relieved.



And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his head

between Judge Mott's feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the road;

he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and

left behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would be at

an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions about

bad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the next

station without trouble.  The Judge distanced the enemy and at last

rattled up to the station and knew that the night's perils were done; but

there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the soldierly

driver was dead.



Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland

drivers, now.  The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a disciple of

Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man--even of the scholarly savages in

the "Last of the Mohicans" who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen

who divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part critically

grammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other part just such

an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk

might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett's works and

studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks--I say

that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, set me

to examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been over-estimating

the Red Man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance.

The revelations that came were disenchanting.  It was curious to see how

quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous,

filthy and repulsive--and how quickly the evidences accumulated that

wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots more or

less modified by circumstances and surroundings--but Goshoots, after all.

They deserve pity, poor creatures; and they can have mine--at this

distance.  Nearer by, they never get anybody's.



There is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington Railroad

Company and many of its employees are Goshoots; but it is an error.

There is only a plausible resemblance, which, while it is apt enough to

mislead the ignorant, cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both

tribes.  But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but very wrong to start

the report referred to above; for however innocent the motive may have

been, the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who

have a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the Rocky

Mountains, Heaven knows!  If we cannot find it in our hearts to give

those poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and compassion, in

God's name let us at least not throw mud at them.









CHAPTER XX.



On the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet

seen, and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon its

heels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless.



On the eighteenth day we encountered the eastward-bound telegraph-

constructors at Reese River station and sent a message to his Excellency

Gov. Nye at Carson City (distant one hundred and fifty-six miles).



On the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert--forty

memorable miles of bottomless sand, into which the coach wheels sunk from

six inches to a foot.  We worked our passage most of the way across.

That is to say, we got out and walked.  It was a dreary pull and a long

and thirsty one, for we had no water.  From one extremity of this desert

to the other, the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses.

It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the

forty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step!  The desert was one

prodigious graveyard.  And the log-chains, wagon tyres, and rotting

wrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones.  I think we saw

log-chains enough rusting there in the desert, to reach across any State

in the Union.  Do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the

fearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to California

endured?



At the border of the Desert lies Carson Lake, or The "Sink" of the

Carson, a shallow, melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred

miles in circumference.  Carson River empties into it and is lost--sinks

mysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun

again--for the lake has no outlet whatever.



There are several rivers in Nevada, and they all have this mysterious

fate.  They end in various lakes or "sinks," and that is the last of

them.  Carson Lake, Humboldt Lake, Walker Lake, Mono Lake, are all great

sheets of water without any visible outlet.  Water is always flowing into

them; none is ever seen to flow out of them, and yet they remain always

level full, neither receding nor overflowing.  What they do with their

surplus is only known to the Creator.



On the western verge of the Desert we halted a moment at Ragtown.  It

consisted of one log house and is not set down on the map.



This reminds me of a circumstance.  Just after we left Julesburg, on the

Platte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said:



"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to

listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was

leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an

engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through

quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.

The coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the

buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through

the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to

go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.

But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on

time'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"



A day or two after that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads, and

he told us a good deal about the country and the Gregory Diggings.

He seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the affairs

of Colorado.  By and by he remarked:



"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to

listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was

leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an

engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through

quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The

coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the

buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through

the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to

go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.

But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on

time!'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"



At Fort Bridger, some days after this, we took on board a cavalry

sergeant, a very proper and soldierly person indeed.  From no other man

during the whole journey, did we gather such a store of concise and well-

arranged military information.  It was surprising to find in the desolate

wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with everything

useful to know in his line of life, and yet of such inferior rank and

unpretentious bearing.  For as much as three hours we listened to him

with unabated interest.  Finally he got upon the subject of trans-

continental travel, and presently said:



"I can tell you a very laughable thing indeed, if you would like to

listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was

leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an

engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through

quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The

coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the

buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through

the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to

go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.

But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on

time!'--and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"



When we were eight hours out from Salt Lake City a Mormon preacher got in

with us at a way station--a gentle, soft-spoken, kindly man, and one whom

any stranger would warm to at first sight.  I can never forget the pathos

that was in his voice as he told, in simple language, the story of his

people's wanderings and unpitied sufferings.  No pulpit eloquence was

ever so moving and so beautiful as this outcast's picture of the first

Mormon pilgrimage across the plains, struggling sorrowfully onward to the

land of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves and

watering it with tears.  His words so wrought upon us that it was a

relief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful

channel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came

under treatment.  One matter after another was pleasantly discussed, and

at length the stranger said:



"I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to

listen to it.  Horace Greeley went over this road once.  When he was

leaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an

engagement to lecture in Placerville, and was very anxious to go through

quick.  Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace.  The

coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the

buttons all off of Horace's coat, and finally shot his head clean through

the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to

go easier--said he warn't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago.

But Hank Monk said, 'Keep your seat, Horace, and I'll get you there on

time!'--and you bet you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!"



Ten miles out of Ragtown we found a poor wanderer who had lain down to

die.  He had walked as long as he could, but his limbs had failed him at

last.  Hunger and fatigue had conquered him.  It would have been inhuman

to leave him there.  We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the

coach.  It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs

of life; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips

we finally brought him to a languid consciousness.  Then we fed him a

little, and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a

grateful light softened his eye.  We made his mail-sack bed as

comfortable as possible, and constructed a pillow for him with our coats.

He seemed very thankful.  Then he looked up in our faces, and said in a

feeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it:



"Gentlemen, I know not who you are, but you have saved my life; and

although I can never be able to repay you for it, I feel that I can at

least make one hour of your long journey lighter.  I take it you are

strangers to this great thorough fare, but I am entirely familiar with

it.  In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if

you would like to listen to it.  Horace Greeley----"



I said, impressively:



"Suffering stranger, proceed at your peril.  You see in me the melancholy

wreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood.  What has brought me to

this?  That thing which you are about to tell.  Gradually but surely,

that tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength, undermined my

constitution, withered my life.  Pity my helplessness.  Spare me only

just this once, and tell me about young George Washington and his little

hatchet for a change."



We were saved.  But not so the invalid.  In trying to retain the anecdote

in his system he strained himself and died in our arms.



I am aware, now, that I ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen

of all that region, what I asked of that mere shadow of a man; for, after

seven years' residence on the Pacific coast, I know that no passenger or

driver on the Overland ever corked that anecdote in, when a stranger was

by, and survived.  Within a period of six years I crossed and recrossed

the Sierras between Nevada and California thirteen times by stage and

listened to that deathless incident four hundred and eighty-one or

eighty-two times.  I have the list somewhere.  Drivers always told it,

conductors told it, landlords told it, chance passengers told it, the

very Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it.  I have had the same

driver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon.  It has

come to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed to

earth, and flavored with whiskey, brandy, beer, cologne, sozodont,

tobacco, garlic, onions, grasshoppers--everything that has a fragrance to

it through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the

sons of men.  I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt

that one; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that

one.  And you never could learn to know it by its smell, because every

time you thought you had learned the smell of it, it would turn up with a

different smell.  Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote,

Richardson has published it; so have Jones, Smith, Johnson, Ross Browne,

and every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot upon

the great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San Francisco; and

I have heard that it is in the Talmud.  I have seen it in print in nine

different foreign languages; I have been told that it is employed in the

inquisition in Rome; and I now learn with regret that it is going to be

set to music.  I do not think that such things are right.



Stage-coaching on the Overland is no more, and stage drivers are a race

defunct.  I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their

successors, the railroad brakemen and conductors, and if these latter

still persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes, as did

many a tourist of other days, that the real grandeurs of the Pacific

coast are not Yo Semite and the Big Trees, but Hank Monk and his

adventure with Horace Greeley.  [And what makes that worn anecdote the

more aggravating, is, that the adventure it celebrates never occurred.

If it were a good anecdote, that seeming demerit would be its chiefest

virtue, for creative power belongs to greatness; but what ought to be

done to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this?  If I

were to suggest what ought to be done to him, I should be called

extravagant--but what does the sixteenth chapter of Daniel say?  Aha!]









CHAPTER XXI.



We were approaching the end of our long journey.  It was the morning of

the twentieth day.  At noon we would reach Carson City, the capital of

Nevada Territory.  We were not glad, but sorry.  It had been a fine

pleasure trip; we had fed fat on wonders every day; we were now well

accustomed to stage life, and very fond of it; so the idea of coming to a

stand-still and settling down to a humdrum existence in a village was not

agreeable, but on the contrary depressing.



Visibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad

mountains.  There was not a tree in sight.  There was no vegetation but

the endless sage-brush and greasewood.  All nature was gray with it.  We

were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in

thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning

house.



We were coated with it like millers; so were the coach, the mules, the

mail-bags, the driver--we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were

all one monotonous color.  Long trains of freight wagons in the distance

envelope in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on

fire.  These teams and their masters were the only life we saw.

Otherwise we moved in the midst of solitude, silence and desolation.

Every twenty steps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen,

with its dust-coated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs.

Frequently a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated

the passing coach with meditative serenity.



By and by Carson City was pointed out to us.  It nestled in the edge of a

great plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an

assemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of mountains

overlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of companionship

and consciousness of earthly things.



We arrived, disembarked, and the stage went on.  It was a "wooden" town;

its population two thousand souls.  The main street consisted of four or

five blocks of little white frame stores which were too high to sit down

on, but not too high for various other purposes; in fact, hardly high

enough.  They were packed close together, side by side, as if room were

scarce in that mighty plain.



The sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and inclined to

rattle when walked upon.  In the middle of the town, opposite the stores,

was the "plaza" which is native to all towns beyond the Rocky Mountains--

a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a liberty pole in it, and very

useful as a place for public auctions, horse trades, and mass meetings,

and likewise for teamsters to camp in.  Two other sides of the plaza were

faced by stores, offices and stables.



The rest of Carson City was pretty scattering.



We were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office and on the

way up to the Governor's from the hotel--among others, to a Mr. Harris,

who was on horseback; he began to say something, but interrupted himself

with the remark:



"I'll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that

swore I helped to rob the California coach--a piece of impertinent

intermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man."



Then he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter,

and the stranger began to explain with another.  When the pistols were

emptied, the stranger resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr.

Harris rode by with a polite nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through

one of his lungs, and several in his hips; and from them issued little

rivulets of blood that coursed down the horse's sides and made the animal

look quite picturesque.  I never saw Harris shoot a man after that but it

recalled to mind that first day in Carson.



This was all we saw that day, for it was two o'clock, now, and according

to custom the daily "Washoe Zephyr" set in; a soaring dust-drift about

the size of the United States set up edgewise came with it, and the

capital of Nevada Territory disappeared from view.



Still, there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting

to new comers; for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things

strange to the upper air--things living and dead, that flitted hither and

thither, going and coming, appearing and disappearing among the rolling

billows of dust--hats, chickens and parasols sailing in the remote

heavens; blankets, tin signs, sage-brush and shingles a shade lower;

door-mats and buffalo robes lower still; shovels and coal scuttles on the

next grade; glass doors, cats and little children on the next; disrupted

lumber yards, light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next; and down only

thirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of emigrating

roofs and vacant lots.



It was something to see that much.  I could have seen more, if I could

have kept the dust out of my eyes.



But seriously a Washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter.  It blows

flimsy houses down, lifts shingle roofs occasionally, rolls up tin ones

like sheet music, now and then blows a stage coach over and spills the

passengers; and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people

there, is, that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are

looking skyward after their hats.  Carson streets seldom look inactive on

Summer afternoons, because there are so many citizens skipping around

their escaping hats, like chambermaids trying to head off a spider.



The "Washoe Zephyr" (Washoe is a pet nickname for Nevada) is a peculiar

Scriptural wind, in that no man knoweth "whence it cometh."  That is to

say, where it originates.  It comes right over the mountains from the

West, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the

other side!  It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the

occasion, and starts from there.  It is a pretty regular wind, in the

summer time.  Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the

next morning; and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours

needs to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward

of the point he is aiming at.  And yet the first complaint a Washoe

visitor to San Francisco makes, is that the sea winds blow so, there!

There is a good deal of human nature in that.



We found the state palace of the Governor of Nevada Territory to consist

of a white frame one-story house with two small rooms in it and a

stanchion supported shed in front--for grandeur--it compelled the respect

of the citizen and inspired the Indians with awe.  The newly arrived

Chief and Associate Justices of the Territory, and other machinery of the

government, were domiciled with less splendor.  They were boarding around

privately, and had their offices in their bedrooms.



The Secretary and I took quarters in the "ranch" of a worthy French lady

by the name of Bridget O'Flannigan, a camp follower of his Excellency the

Governor.  She had known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief of

the Metropolitan Police of New York, and she would not desert him in his

adversity as Governor of Nevada.



Our room was on the lower floor, facing the plaza, and when we had got

our bed, a small table, two chairs, the government fire-proof safe, and

the Unabridged Dictionary into it, there was still room enough left for a

visitor--may be two, but not without straining the walls.  But the walls

could stand it--at least the partitions could, for they consisted simply

of one thickness of white "cotton domestic" stretched from corner to

corner of the room.  This was the rule in Carson--any other kind of

partition was the rare exception.  And if you stood in a dark room and

your neighbors in the next had lights, the shadows on your canvas told

queer secrets sometimes!  Very often these partitions were made of old

flour sacks basted together; and then the difference between the common

herd and the aristocracy was, that the common herd had unornamented

sacks, while the walls of the aristocrat were overpowering with

rudimental fresco--i.e., red and blue mill brands on the flour sacks.



Occasionally, also, the better classes embellished their canvas by

pasting pictures from Harper's Weekly on them.  In many cases, too, the

wealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other evidences of a

sumptuous and luxurious taste.  [Washoe people take a joke so hard that I

must explain that the above description was only the rule; there were

many honorable exceptions in Carson--plastered ceilings and houses that

had considerable furniture in them.--M. T.]



We had a carpet and a genuine queen's-ware washbowl.  Consequently we

were hated without reserve by the other tenants of the O'Flannigan

"ranch."  When we added a painted oilcloth window curtain, we simply took

our lives into our own hands.  To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs

and took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen

white pine cot-bedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the one sole

room of which the second story consisted.



It was a jolly company, the fourteen.  They were principally voluntary

camp-followers of the Governor, who had joined his retinue by their own

election at New York and San Francisco and came along, feeling that in

the scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not make

their condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably expect

to make it better.  They were popularly known as the "Irish Brigade,"

though there were only four or five Irishmen among all the Governor's

retainers.



His good-natured Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen

created--especially when there arose a rumor that they were paid

assassins of his, brought along to quietly reduce the democratic vote

when desirable!



Mrs. O'Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week

apiece, and they were cheerfully giving their notes for it.  They were

perfectly satisfied, but Bridget presently found that notes that could

not be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a Carson boarding-

house.  So she began to harry the Governor to find employment for the

"Brigade."  Her importunities and theirs together drove him to a gentle

desperation at last, and he finally summoned the Brigade to the presence.

Then, said he:



"Gentlemen, I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you--a

service which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes, and

afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by

observation and study.  I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City

westward to a certain point!  When the legislature meets I will have the

necessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged."



"What, a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains?"



"Well, then, survey it eastward to a certain point!"



He converted them into surveyors, chain-bearers and so on, and turned

them loose in the desert.  It was "recreation" with a vengeance!

Recreation on foot, lugging chains through sand and sage-brush, under a

sultry sun and among cattle bones, cayotes and tarantulas.



"Romantic adventure" could go no further.  They surveyed very slowly,

very deliberately, very carefully.  They returned every night during the

first week, dusty, footsore, tired, and hungry, but very jolly.  They

brought in great store of prodigious hairy spiders--tarantulas--and

imprisoned them in covered tumblers up stairs in the "ranch."  After the

first week, they had to camp on the field, for they were getting well

eastward.  They made a good many inquiries as to the location of that

indefinite "certain point," but got no information.  At last, to a

peculiarly urgent inquiry of "How far eastward?"  Governor Nye

telegraphed back:



"To the Atlantic Ocean, blast you!--and then bridge it and go on!"



This brought back the dusty toilers, who sent in a report and ceased from

their labors.  The Governor was always comfortable about it; he said Mrs.

O'Flannigan would hold him for the Brigade's board anyhow, and he

intended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys; he said,

with his old-time pleasant twinkle, that he meant to survey them into

Utah and then telegraph Brigham to hang them for trespass!



The surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them, and so we had quite

a menagerie arranged along the shelves of the room.  Some of these

spiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy, muscular

legs, and when their feelings were hurt, or their dignity offended, they

were the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish.

If their glass prison-houses were touched ever so lightly they were up

and spoiling for a fight in a minute.  Starchy?--proud?  Indeed, they

would take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress.

There was as usual a furious "zephyr" blowing the first night of the

brigade's return, and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew

off, and a corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch.

There was a simultaneous awakening, and a tumultuous muster of the

brigade in the dark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other

in the narrow aisle between the bedrows.  In the midst of the turmoil,

Bob H---- sprung up out of a sound sleep, and knocked down a shelf with

his head.  Instantly he shouted:



"Turn out, boys--the tarantulas is loose!"



No warning ever sounded so dreadful.  Nobody tried, any longer, to leave

the room, lest he might step on a tarantula.  Every man groped for a

trunk or a bed, and jumped on it.  Then followed the strangest silence--a

silence of grisly suspense it was, too--waiting, expectancy, fear.  It

was as dark as pitch, and one had to imagine the spectacle of those

fourteen scant-clad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds, for not a

thing could be seen.  Then came occasional little interruptions of the

silence, and one could recognize a man and tell his locality by his

voice, or locate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or

changes of position.  The occasional voices were not given to much

speaking--you simply heard a gentle ejaculation of "Ow!" followed by a

solid thump, and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or

something touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor.

Another silence.  Presently you would hear a gasping voice say:



"Su--su--something's crawling up the back of my neck!"



Every now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a

sorrowful "O Lord!" and then you knew that somebody was getting away from

something he took for a tarantula, and not losing any time about it,

either.  Directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear:



"I've got him!  I've got him!" [Pause, and probable change of

circumstances.]  "No, he's got me!  Oh, ain't they never going to fetch a

lantern!"



The lantern came at that moment, in the hands of Mrs. O'Flannigan, whose

anxiety to know the amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not

prevented her waiting a judicious interval, after getting out of bed and

lighting up, to see if the wind was done, now, up stairs, or had a larger

contract.



The landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was

picturesque, and might have been funny to some people, but was not to us.

Although we were perched so strangely upon boxes, trunks and beds, and so

strangely attired, too, we were too earnestly distressed and too

genuinely miserable to see any fun about it, and there was not the

semblance of a smile anywhere visible.  I know I am not capable of

suffering more than I did during those few minutes of suspense in the

dark, surrounded by those creeping, bloody-minded tarantulas.  I had

skipped from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agony, and every

time I touched anything that was furzy I fancied I felt the fangs.  I had

rather go to war than live that episode over again.  Nobody was hurt.

The man who thought a tarantula had "got him" was mistaken--only a crack

in a box had caught his finger.  Not one of those escaped tarantulas was

ever seen again.  There were ten or twelve of them.  We took candles and

hunted the place high and low for them, but with no success.  Did we go

back to bed then?  We did nothing of the kind.  Money could not have

persuaded us to do it.  We sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage

and keeping a sharp lookout for the enemy.









CHAPTER XXII.



It was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and the weather

superb.  In two or three weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with

the curious new country and concluded to put off my return to "the

States" awhile.  I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch

hat, blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and gloried in

the absence of coat, vest and braces.  I felt rowdyish and "bully," (as

the historian Josephus phrases it, in his fine chapter upon the

destruction of the Temple).  It seemed to me that nothing could be so

fine and so romantic.  I had become an officer of the government, but

that was for mere sublimity.  The office was an unique sinecure.  I had

nothing to do and no salary.  I was private Secretary to his majesty the

Secretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us.  So Johnny

K---- and I devoted our time to amusement.  He was the young son of an

Ohio nabob and was out there for recreation.  He got it.  We had heard a

world of talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally

curiosity drove us thither to see it.  Three or four members of the

Brigade had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and

stored up a quantity of provisions in their camp.  We strapped a couple

of blankets on our shoulders and took an axe apiece and started--for we

intended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy.

We were on foot.  The reader will find it advantageous to go horseback.

We were told that the distance was eleven miles.  We tramped a long time

on level ground, and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a

thousand miles high and looked over.  No lake there.  We descended on the

other side, crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or

four thousand miles high, apparently, and looked over again.  No lake

yet.  We sat down tired and perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to

curse those people who had beguiled us.  Thus refreshed, we presently

resumed the march with renewed vigor and determination.  We plodded on,

two or three hours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us--a noble

sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the

level of the sea, and walled in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that

towered aloft full three thousand feet higher still!  It was a vast oval,

and one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling

around it.  As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly

photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the

fairest picture the whole earth affords.



We found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and without loss

of time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that

signified the locality of the camp.  I got Johnny to row--not because I

mind exertion myself, but because it makes me sick to ride backwards when

I am at work.  But I steered.  A three-mile pull brought us to the camp

just as the night fell, and we stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly

hungry.  In a "cache" among the rocks we found the provisions and the

cooking utensils, and then, all fatigued as I was, I sat down on a

boulder and superintended while Johnny gathered wood and cooked supper.

Many a man who had gone through what I had, would have wanted to rest.



It was a delicious supper--hot bread, fried bacon, and black coffee.  It

was a delicious solitude we were in, too.  Three miles away was a saw-

mill and some workmen, but there were not fifteen other human beings

throughout the wide circumference of the lake.  As the darkness closed

down and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels, we

smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our

pains.  In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two

large boulders and soon feel asleep, careless of the procession of ants

that passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our persons.

Nothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us, for it had been fairly

earned, and if our consciences had any sins on them they had to adjourn

court for that night, any way.  The wind rose just as we were losing

consciousness, and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf

upon the shore.



It is always very cold on that lake shore in the night, but we had plenty

of blankets and were warm enough.  We never moved a muscle all night, but

waked at early dawn in the original positions, and got up at once,

thoroughly refreshed, free from soreness, and brim full of friskiness.

There is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience.  That

morning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day before--

sick ones at any rate.  But the world is slow, and people will go to

"water cures" and "movement cures" and to foreign lands for health.

Three months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy

to his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator.  I do

not mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones.

The air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and

delicious.  And why shouldn't it be?--it is the same the angels breathe.

I think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a

man cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side.  Not under a

roof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer

time.  I know a man who went there to die.  But he made a failure of it.

He was a skeleton when he came, and could barely stand.  He had no

appetite, and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future.

Three months later he was sleeping out of doors regularly, eating all he

could hold, three times a day, and chasing game over mountains three

thousand feet high for recreation.  And he was a skeleton no longer, but

weighed part of a ton.  This is no fancy sketch, but the truth.  His

disease was consumption.  I confidently commend his experience to other

skeletons.



I superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in

the boat and skirted along the lake shore about three miles and

disembarked.  We liked the appearance of the place, and so we claimed

some three hundred acres of it and stuck our "notices" on a tree.  It was

yellow pine timber land--a dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and

from one to five feet through at the butt.  It was necessary to fence our

property or we could not hold it.  That is to say, it was necessary to

cut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way as to form

a sort of enclosure (with pretty wide gaps in it).  We cut down three

trees apiece, and found it such heart-breaking work that we decided to

"rest our case" on those; if they held the property, well and good; if

they didn't, let the property spill out through the gaps and go; it was

no use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land.

Next day we came back to build a house--for a house was also necessary,

in order to hold the property.  We decided to build a substantial log-

house and excite the envy of the Brigade boys; but by the time we had cut

and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate, and

so we concluded to build it of saplings.  However, two saplings, duly cut

and trimmed, compelled recognition of the fact that a still modester

architecture would satisfy the law, and so we concluded to build a

"brush" house.  We devoted the next day to this work, but we did so much

"sitting around" and discussing, that by the middle of the afternoon we

had achieved only a half-way sort of affair which one of us had to watch

while the other cut brush, lest if both turned our backs we might not be

able to find it again, it had such a strong family resemblance to the

surrounding vegetation.  But we were satisfied with it.



We were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the

protection of the law.  Therefore we decided to take up our residence on

our own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only such

an experience can bring.  Late the next afternoon, after a good long

rest, we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and

cooking utensils we could carry off--borrow is the more accurate word--

and just as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing.









CHAPTER XXIII.



If there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber

ranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life which I

have not read of in books or experienced in person.  We did not see a

human being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds but those

that were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and

now and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche.  The forest about us

was dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with

sunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear, or rippled and

breezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature's mood; and its

circling border of mountain domes, clothed with forests, scarred with

land-slides, cloven by canons and valleys, and helmeted with glittering

snow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture.  The view was always

fascinating, bewitching, entrancing.  The eye was never tired of gazing,

night or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one grief, and that was

that it could not look always, but must close sometimes in sleep.



We slept in the sand close to the water's edge, between two protecting

boulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds for us.  We never

took any paregoric to make us sleep.  At the first break of dawn we were

always up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor

and exuberance of spirits.  That is, Johnny was--but I held his hat.

While smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel

peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as

it swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests

free.  We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water

till every little detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in

and finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete.  Then to

"business."



That is, drifting around in the boat.  We were on the north shore.

There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white.

This gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage

than it has elsewhere on the lake.  We usually pushed out a hundred yards

or so from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let

the boat drift by the hour whither it would.  We seldom talked.

It interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious

rest and indolence brought.  The shore all along was indented with deep,

curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the

sand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space--rose

up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded

with tall pines.



So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or

thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat

seemed floating in the air!  Yes, where it was even eighty feet deep.

Every little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every hand's-

breadth of sand.  Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite boulder, as

large as a village church, would start out of the bottom apparently, and

seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently it threatened to

touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar and

avert the danger.  But the boat would float on, and the boulder descend

again, and then we could see that when we had been exactly above it, it

must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface.  Down

through the transparency of these great depths, the water was not merely

transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so.  All objects seen through it

had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but of every minute

detail, which they would not have had when seen simply through the same

depth of atmosphere.  So empty and airy did all spaces seem below us, and

so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in mid-nothingness, that

we called these boat-excursions "balloon-voyages."



We fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week.  We could

see trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us, or

sleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite--they could see

the line too plainly, perhaps.  We frequently selected the trout we

wanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his

nose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an

annoyed manner, and shift his position.



We bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for all it

looked so sunny.  Sometimes we rowed out to the "blue water," a mile or

two from shore.  It was as dead blue as indigo there, because of the

immense depth.  By official measurement the lake in its centre is one

thousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep!



Sometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in camp, and smoked

pipes and read some old well-worn novels.  At night, by the camp-fire, we

played euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind--and played them with

cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer's acquaintance with

them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of

diamonds.



We never slept in our "house."  It never recurred to us, for one thing;

and besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough.  We

did not wish to strain it.



By and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old

camp and laid in a new supply.  We were gone all day, and reached home

again about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry.  While Johnny was

carrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our "house" for future

use, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot,

ashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat to

get the frying-pan.  While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny,

and looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises!

Johnny was on the other side of it.  He had to run through the flames to

get to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the

devastation.



The ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire

touched them off as if they were gunpowder.  It was wonderful to see with

what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled!  My coffee-pot was

gone, and everything with it.  In a minute and a half the fire seized

upon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high,

and then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific.

We were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained,

spell-bound.



Within half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of

flame!  It went surging up adjacent ridges--surmounted them and

disappeared in the canons beyond--burst into view upon higher and farther

ridges, presently--shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove again--

flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the mountain-side-

-threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and sent them

trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and ribs and

gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty mountain-fronts were

webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava streams.  Away

across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy glare, and the

firmament above was a reflected hell!



Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the

lake!  Both pictures were sublime, both were beautiful; but that in the

lake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held

it with the stronger fascination.



We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours.  We never thought

of supper, and never felt fatigue.  But at eleven o'clock the

conflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness

stole down upon the landscape again.



Hunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat.  The provisions

were all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go to see.  We were homeless

wanderers again, without any property.  Our fence was gone, our house

burned down; no insurance.  Our pine forest was well scorched, the dead

trees all burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away.  Our

blankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we lay down and went

to sleep.  The next morning we started back to the old camp, but while

out a long way from shore, so great a storm came up that we dared not try

to land.  So I baled out the seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled heavily

through the billows till we had reached a point three or four miles

beyond the camp.  The storm was increasing, and it became evident that it

was better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down in a

hundred fathoms of water; so we ran in, with tall white-caps following,

and I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore.

The instant the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that washed crew

and cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble.  We shivered in the lee of

a boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all the night through.  In

the morning the tempest had gone down, and we paddled down to the camp

without any unnecessary delay.  We were so starved that we ate up the

rest of the Brigade's provisions, and then set out to Carson to tell them

about it and ask their forgiveness.  It was accorded, upon payment of

damages.



We made many trips to the lake after that, and had many a hair-breadth

escape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be recorded in any

history.









CHAPTER XXIV.



I resolved to have a horse to ride.  I had never seen such wild, free,

magnificent horsemanship outside of a circus as these picturesquely-clad

Mexicans, Californians and Mexicanized Americans displayed in Carson

streets every day.  How they rode!  Leaning just gently forward out of

the perpendicular, easy and nonchalant, with broad slouch-hat brim blown

square up in front, and long riata swinging above the head, they swept

through the town like the wind!  The next minute they were only a sailing

puff of dust on the far desert.  If they trotted, they sat up gallantly

and gracefully, and seemed part of the horse; did not go jiggering up and

down after the silly Miss-Nancy fashion of the riding-schools.  I had

quickly learned to tell a horse from a cow, and was full of anxiety to

learn more.  I was resolved to buy a horse.



While the thought was rankling in my mind, the auctioneer came skurrying

through the plaza on a black beast that had as many humps and corners on

him as a dromedary, and was necessarily uncomely; but he was "going,

going, at twenty-two!--horse, saddle and bridle at twenty-two dollars,

gentlemen!" and I could hardly resist.



A man whom I did not know (he turned out to be the auctioneer's brother)

noticed the wistful look in my eye, and observed that that was a very

remarkable horse to be going at such a price; and added that the saddle

alone was worth the money.  It was a Spanish saddle, with ponderous

'tapidaros', and furnished with the ungainly sole-leather covering with

the unspellable name.  I said I had half a notion to bid.  Then this

keen-eyed person appeared to me to be "taking my measure"; but I

dismissed the suspicion when he spoke, for his manner was full of

guileless candor and truthfulness.  Said he:



"I know that horse--know him well.  You are a stranger, I take it, and so

you might think he was an American horse, maybe, but I assure you he is

not.  He is nothing of the kind; but--excuse my speaking in a low voice,

other people being near--he is, without the shadow of a doubt, a Genuine

Mexican Plug!"



I did not know what a Genuine Mexican Plug was, but there was something

about this man's way of saying it, that made me swear inwardly that I

would own a Genuine Mexican Plug, or die.



"Has he any other--er--advantages?"  I inquired, suppressing what

eagerness I could.



He hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my army-shirt, led me to one

side, and breathed in my ear impressively these words:



"He can out-buck anything in America!"



"Going, going, going--at twent--ty--four dollars and a half, gen--"



"Twenty-seven!" I shouted, in a frenzy.



"And sold!" said the auctioneer, and passed over the Genuine Mexican Plug

to me.



I could scarcely contain my exultation.  I paid the money, and put the

animal in a neighboring livery-stable to dine and rest himself.



In the afternoon I brought the creature into the plaza, and certain

citizens held him by the head, and others by the tail, while I mounted

him.  As soon as they let go, he placed all his feet in a bunch together,

lowered his back, and then suddenly arched it upward, and shot me

straight into the air a matter of three or four feet!  I came as straight

down again, lit in the saddle, went instantly up again, came down almost

on the high pommel, shot up again, and came down on the horse's neck--all

in the space of three or four seconds.  Then he rose and stood almost

straight up on his hind feet, and I, clasping his lean neck desperately,

slid back into the saddle and held on.  He came down, and immediately

hoisted his heels into the air, delivering a vicious kick at the sky, and

stood on his forefeet.  And then down he came once more, and began the

original exercise of shooting me straight up again.  The third time I

went up I heard a stranger say:



"Oh, don't he buck, though!"



While I was up, somebody struck the horse a sounding thwack with a

leathern strap, and when I arrived again the Genuine Mexican Plug was not

there.  A California youth chased him up and caught him, and asked if he

might have a ride.  I granted him that luxury.  He mounted the Genuine,

got lifted into the air once, but sent his spurs home as he descended,

and the horse darted away like a telegram.  He soared over three fences

like a bird, and disappeared down the road toward the Washoe Valley.



I sat down on a stone, with a sigh, and by a natural impulse one of my

hands sought my forehead, and the other the base of my stomach.  I

believe I never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the human

machinery--for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere.  Pen

cannot describe how I was jolted up.  Imagination cannot conceive how

disjointed I was--how internally, externally and universally I was

unsettled, mixed up and ruptured.  There was a sympathetic crowd around

me, though.



One elderly-looking comforter said:



"Stranger, you've been taken in.  Everybody in this camp knows that

horse.  Any child, any Injun, could have told you that he'd buck; he is

the very worst devil to buck on the continent of America.  You hear me.

I'm Curry.  Old Curry.  Old Abe Curry.  And moreover, he is a simon-pure,

out-and-out, genuine d--d Mexican plug, and an uncommon mean one at that,

too.  Why, you turnip, if you had laid low and kept dark, there's chances

to buy an American horse for mighty little more than you paid for that

bloody old foreign relic."



I gave no sign; but I made up my mind that if the auctioneer's brother's

funeral took place while I was in the Territory I would postpone all

other recreations and attend it.



After a gallop of sixteen miles the Californian youth and the Genuine

Mexican Plug came tearing into town again, shedding foam-flakes like the

spume-spray that drives before a typhoon, and, with one final skip over a

wheelbarrow and a Chinaman, cast anchor in front of the "ranch."



Such panting and blowing!  Such spreading and contracting of the red

equine nostrils, and glaring of the wild equine eye!  But was the

imperial beast subjugated?  Indeed he was not.



His lordship the Speaker of the House thought he was, and mounted him to

go down to the Capitol; but the first dash the creature made was over a

pile of telegraph poles half as high as a church; and his time to the

Capitol--one mile and three quarters--remains unbeaten to this day.  But

then he took an advantage--he left out the mile, and only did the three

quarters.  That is to say, he made a straight cut across lots, preferring

fences and ditches to a crooked road; and when the Speaker got to the

Capitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made

the trip on a comet.



In the evening the Speaker came home afoot for exercise, and got the

Genuine towed back behind a quartz wagon.  The next day I loaned the

animal to the Clerk of the House to go down to the Dana silver mine, six

miles, and he walked back for exercise, and got the horse towed.

Everybody I loaned him to always walked back; they never could get enough

exercise any other way.



Still, I continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him,

my idea being to get him crippled, and throw him on the borrower's hands,

or killed, and make the borrower pay for him.  But somehow nothing ever

happened to him.  He took chances that no other horse ever took and

survived, but he always came out safe.  It was his daily habit to try

experiments that had always before been considered impossible, but he

always got through.  Sometimes he miscalculated a little, and did not get

his rider through intact, but he always got through himself.  Of course I

had tried to sell him; but that was a stretch of simplicity which met

with little sympathy.  The auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on

him for four days, dispersing the populace, interrupting business, and

destroying children, and never got a bid--at least never any but the

eighteen-dollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make.

The people only smiled pleasantly, and restrained their desire to buy, if

they had any.  Then the auctioneer brought in his bill, and I withdrew

the horse from the market.  We tried to trade him off at private vendue

next, offering him at a sacrifice for second-hand tombstones, old iron,

temperance tracts--any kind of property.  But holders were stiff, and we

retired from the market again.  I never tried to ride the horse any more.

Walking was good enough exercise for a man like me, that had nothing the

matter with him except ruptures, internal injuries, and such things.

Finally I tried to give him away.  But it was a failure.  Parties said

earthquakes were handy enough on the Pacific coast--they did not wish to

own one.  As a last resort I offered him to the Governor for the use of

the "Brigade."  His face lit up eagerly at first, but toned down again,

and he said the thing would be too palpable.



Just then the livery stable man brought in his bill for six weeks'

keeping--stall-room for the horse, fifteen dollars; hay for the horse,

two hundred and fifty!  The Genuine Mexican Plug had eaten a ton of the

article, and the man said he would have eaten a hundred if he had let

him.



I will remark here, in all seriousness, that the regular price of hay

during that year and a part of the next was really two hundred and fifty

dollars a ton.  During a part of the previous year it had sold at five

hundred a ton, in gold, and during the winter before that there was such

scarcity of the article that in several instances small quantities had

brought eight hundred dollars a ton in coin!  The consequence might be

guessed without my telling it: peopled turned their stock loose to

starve, and before the spring arrived Carson and Eagle valleys were

almost literally carpeted with their carcases!  Any old settler there

will verify these statements.



I managed to pay the livery bill, and that same day I gave the Genuine

Mexican Plug to a passing Arkansas emigrant whom fortune delivered into

my hand.  If this ever meets his eye, he will doubtless remember the

donation.



Now whoever has had the luck to ride a real Mexican plug will recognize

the animal depicted in this chapter, and hardly consider him exaggerated

--but the uninitiated will feel justified in regarding his portrait as a

fancy sketch, perhaps.









CHAPTER XXV.



Originally, Nevada was a part of Utah and was called Carson county; and a

pretty large county it was, too.  Certain of its valleys produced no end

of hay, and this attracted small colonies of Mormon stock-raisers and

farmers to them.  A few orthodox Americans straggled in from California,

but no love was lost between the two classes of colonists.  There was

little or no friendly intercourse; each party staid to itself.  The

Mormons were largely in the majority, and had the additional advantage of

being peculiarly under the protection of the Mormon government of the

Territory.  Therefore they could afford to be distant, and even

peremptory toward their neighbors.  One of the traditions of Carson

Valley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the time I

speak of.  The hired girl of one of the American families was Irish, and

a Catholic; yet it was noted with surprise that she was the only person

outside of the Mormon ring who could get favors from the Mormons.  She

asked kindnesses of them often, and always got them.  It was a mystery to

everybody.  But one day as she was passing out at the door, a large bowie

knife dropped from under her apron, and when her mistress asked for an

explanation she observed that she was going out to "borry a wash-tub from

the Mormons!"



In 1858 silver lodes were discovered in "Carson County," and then the

aspect of things changed.  Californians began to flock in, and the

American element was soon in the majority.  Allegiance to Brigham Young

and Utah was renounced, and a temporary territorial government for

"Washoe" was instituted by the citizens.  Governor Roop was the first and

only chief magistrate of it.  In due course of time Congress passed a

bill to organize "Nevada Territory," and President Lincoln sent out

Governor Nye to supplant Roop.



At this time the population of the Territory was about twelve or fifteen

thousand, and rapidly increasing.  Silver mines were being vigorously

developed and silver mills erected.  Business of all kinds was active and

prosperous and growing more so day by day.



The people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government, but

did not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant States put in

authority over them--a sentiment that was natural enough.  They thought

the officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among

prominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion, and who

would be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly acquainted

with the needs of the Territory.  They were right in viewing the matter

thus, without doubt.  The new officers were "emigrants," and that was no

title to anybody's affection or admiration either.



The new government was received with considerable coolness.  It was not

only a foreign intruder, but a poor one.  It was not even worth plucking

--except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such.  Everybody

knew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year

in greenbacks for its support--about money enough to run a quartz mill a

month.  And everybody knew, also, that the first year's money was still

in Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and

difficult process.  Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a

credit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent

haste.



There is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a new-born

Territorial government to get a start in this world.  Ours had a trying

time of it.  The Organic Act and the "instructions" from the State

Department commanded that a legislature should be elected at such-and-

such a time, and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a date.  It

was easy to get legislators, even at three dollars a day, although board

was four dollars and fifty cents, for distinction has its charm in Nevada

as well as elsewhere, and there were plenty of patriotic souls out of

employment; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet in was another

matter altogether.  Carson blandly declined to give a room rent-free, or

let one to the government on credit.



But when Curry heard of the difficulty, he came forward, solitary and

alone, and shouldered the Ship of State over the bar and got her afloat

again.  I refer to "Curry--Old Curry--Old Abe Curry."  But for him the

legislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert.  He offered his

large stone building just outside the capital limits, rent-free, and it

was gladly accepted.  Then he built a horse-railroad from town to the

capitol, and carried the legislators gratis.



He also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature, and

covered the floors with clean saw-dust by way of carpet and spittoon

combined.  But for Curry the government would have died in its tender

infancy.  A canvas partition to separate the Senate from the House of

Representatives was put up by the Secretary, at a cost of three dollars

and forty cents, but the United States declined to pay for it.  Upon

being reminded that the "instructions" permitted the payment of a liberal

rent for a legislative hall, and that that money was saved to the country

by Mr. Curry's generosity, the United States said that did not alter the

matter, and the three dollars and forty cents would be subtracted from

the Secretary's eighteen hundred dollar salary--and it was!



The matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature of

the new government's difficulties.  The Secretary was sworn to obey his

volume of written "instructions," and these commanded him to do two

certain things without fail, viz.:



1.  Get the House and Senate journals printed; and,

2.  For this work, pay one dollar and fifty cents per "thousand" for

composition, and one dollar and fifty cents per "token" for press-work,

in greenbacks.



It was easy to swear to do these two things, but it was entirely

impossible to do more than one of them.  When greenbacks had gone down to

forty cents on the dollar, the prices regularly charged everybody by

printing establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per "thousand"

and one dollar and fifty cents per "token," in gold.  The "instructions"

commanded that the Secretary regard a paper dollar issued by the

government as equal to any other dollar issued by the government.  Hence

the printing of the journals was discontinued.  Then the United States

sternly rebuked the Secretary for disregarding the "instructions," and

warned him to correct his ways.  Wherefore he got some printing done,

forwarded the bill to Washington with full exhibits of the high prices of

things in the Territory, and called attention to a printed market report

wherein it would be observed that even hay was two hundred and fifty

dollars a ton.  The United States responded by subtracting the printing-

bill from the Secretary's suffering salary--and moreover remarked with

dense gravity that he would find nothing in his "instructions" requiring

him to purchase hay!



Nothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a U.S.

Treasury Comptroller's understanding.  The very fires of the hereafter

could get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it.  In the days I

speak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that twenty

thousand dollars would not go as far in Nevada, where all commodities

ranged at an enormous figure, as it would in the other Territories, where

exceeding cheapness was the rule.  He was an officer who looked out for

the little expenses all the time.  The Secretary of the Territory kept

his office in his bedroom, as I before remarked; and he charged the

United States no rent, although his "instructions" provided for that item

and he could have justly taken advantage of it (a thing which I would

have done with more than lightning promptness if I had been Secretary

myself).  But the United States never applauded this devotion.  Indeed, I

think my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person in its

employ.



Those "instructions" (we used to read a chapter from them every morning,

as intellectual gymnastics, and a couple of chapters in Sunday school

every Sabbath, for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had

much valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics)

those "instructions" commanded that pen-knives, envelopes, pens and

writing-paper be furnished the members of the legislature.  So the

Secretary made the purchase and the distribution.  The knives cost three

dollars apiece.  There was one too many, and the Secretary gave it to the

Clerk of the House of Representatives.  The United States said the Clerk

of the House was not a "member" of the legislature, and took that three

dollars out of the Secretary's salary, as usual.



White men charged three or four dollars a "load" for sawing up stove-

wood.  The Secretary was sagacious enough to know that the United States

would never pay any such price as that; so he got an Indian to saw up a

load of office wood at one dollar and a half.  He made out the usual

voucher, but signed no name to it--simply appended a note explaining that

an Indian had done the work, and had done it in a very capable and

satisfactory way, but could not sign the voucher owing to lack of ability

in the necessary direction.  The Secretary had to pay that dollar and a

half.  He thought the United States would admire both his economy and his

honesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a

pretended Indian's signature to the voucher, but the United States did

not see it in that light.



The United States was too much accustomed to employing dollar-and-a-half

thieves in all manner of official capacities to regard his explanation of

the voucher as having any foundation in fact.



But the next time the Indian sawed wood for us I taught him to make a

cross at the bottom of the voucher--it looked like a cross that had been

drunk a year--and then I "witnessed" it and it went through all right.

The United States never said a word.  I was sorry I had not made the

voucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one.



The government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic

villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable

pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.



That was a fine collection of sovereigns, that first Nevada legislature.

They levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand dollars and

ordered expenditures to the extent of about a million.  Yet they had

their little periodical explosions of economy like all other bodies of

the kind.  A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by

dispensing with the Chaplain.  And yet that short-sighted man needed the

Chaplain more than any other member, perhaps, for he generally sat with

his feet on his desk, eating raw turnips, during the morning prayer.



The legislature sat sixty days, and passed private tollroad franchises

all the time.  When they adjourned it was estimated that every citizen

owned about three franchises, and it was believed that unless Congress

gave the Territory another degree of longitude there would not be room

enough to accommodate the toll-roads.  The ends of them were hanging over

the boundary line everywhere like a fringe.



The fact is, the freighting business had grown to such important

proportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly

acquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines.









CHAPTER XXVI.



By and by I was smitten with the silver fever.  "Prospecting parties"

were leaving for the mountains every day, and discovering and taking

possession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz.  Plainly

this was the road to fortune.  The great "Gould and Curry" mine was held

at three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two

months it had sprung up to eight hundred.  The "Ophir" had been worth

only a mere trifle, a year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly four

thousand dollars a foot!  Not a mine could be named that had not

experienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time.

Everybody was talking about these marvels.  Go where you would, you heard

nothing else, from morning till far into the night.  Tom So-and-So had

sold out of the "Amanda Smith" for $40,000--hadn't a cent when he "took

up" the ledge six months ago.  John Jones had sold half his interest in

the "Bald Eagle and Mary Ann" for $65,000, gold coin, and gone to the

States for his family.  The widow Brewster had "struck it rich" in the

"Golden Fleece" and sold ten feet for $18,000--hadn't money enough to buy

a crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson's

wake last spring.  The "Last Chance" had found a "clay casing" and knew

they were "right on the ledge"--consequence, "feet" that went begging

yesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy owners who

could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday

were roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm personal

friends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from

long-continued want of practice.  Johnny Morgan, a common loafer, had

gone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand

dollars, in consequence of the decision in the "Lady Franklin and Rough

and Ready" lawsuit.  And so on--day in and day out the talk pelted our

ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.



I would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the

rest.  Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs of lead, were

arriving from the mills every day, and such sights as that gave substance

to the wild talk about me.  I succumbed and grew as frenzied as the

craziest.



Every few days news would come of the discovery of a bran-new mining

region; immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness,

and away the surplus population would scamper to take possession.  By the

time I was fairly inoculated with the disease, "Esmeralda" had just had a

run and "Humboldt" was beginning to shriek for attention.  "Humboldt!

Humboldt!" was the new cry, and straightway Humboldt, the newest of the

new, the richest of the rich, the most marvellous of the marvellous

discoveries in silver-land was occupying two columns of the public prints

to "Esmeralda's" one.  I was just on the point of starting to Esmeralda,

but turned with the tide and got ready for Humboldt.  That the reader may

see what moved me, and what would as surely have moved him had he been

there, I insert here one of the newspaper letters of the day.  It and

several other letters from the same calm hand were the main means of

converting me.  I shall not garble the extract, but put it in just as it

appeared in the Daily Territorial Enterprise:



      But what about our mines?  I shall be candid with you.  I shall

      express an honest opinion, based upon a thorough examination.

      Humboldt county is the richest mineral region upon God's footstool.

      Each mountain range is gorged with the precious ores.  Humboldt is

      the true Golconda.



      The other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four

      thousand dollars to the ton.  A week or two ago an assay of just

      such surface developments made returns of seven thousand dollars to

      the ton.  Our mountains are full of rambling prospectors.  Each day

      and almost every hour reveals new and more startling evidences of

      the profuse and intensified wealth of our favored county.  The metal

      is not silver alone.  There are distinct ledges of auriferous ore.

      A late discovery plainly evinces cinnabar.  The coarser metals are

      in gross abundance.  Lately evidences of bituminous coal have been

      detected.  My theory has ever been that coal is a ligneous

      formation.  I told Col.  Whitman, in times past, that the

      neighborhood of Dayton (Nevada) betrayed no present or previous

      manifestations of a ligneous foundation, and that hence I had no

      confidence in his lauded coal mines.  I repeated the same doctrine

      to the exultant coal discoverers of Humboldt.  I talked with my

      friend Captain Burch on the subject.  My pyrhanism vanished upon his

      statement that in the very region referred to he had seen petrified

      trees of the length of two hundred feet.  Then is the fact

      established that huge forests once cast their grim shadows over this

      remote section.  I am firm in the coal faith.



      Have no fears of the mineral resources of Humboldt county.  They are

      immense--incalculable.



Let me state one or two things which will help the reader to better

comprehend certain items in the above.  At this time, our near neighbor,

Gold Hill, was the most successful silver mining locality in Nevada.  It

was from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks

came.  "Very rich" (and scarce) Gold Hill ore yielded from $100 to $400

to the ton; but the usual yield was only $20 to $40 per ton--that is to

say, each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars.

But the reader will perceive by the above extract, that in Humboldt from

one fourth to nearly half the mass was silver!  That is to say, every one

hundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three

hundred and fifty in it.  Some days later this same correspondent wrote:



      I have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this

      region--it is incredible.  The intestines of our mountains are

      gorged with precious ore to plethora.  I have said that nature

      has so shaped our mountains as to furnish most excellent

      facilities for the working of our mines.  I have also told you

      that the country about here is pregnant with the finest mill

      sites in the world.  But what is the mining history of Humboldt?

      The Sheba mine is in the hands of energetic San Francisco

      capitalists.  It would seem that the ore is combined with metals

      that render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain

      machinery.  The proprietors have combined the capital and labor

      hinted at in my exordium.  They are toiling and probing.  Their

      tunnel has reached the length of one hundred feet.  From primal

      assays alone, coupled with the development of the mine and public

      confidence in the continuance of effort, the stock had reared

      itself to eight hundred dollars market value.  I do not know that

      one ton of the ore has been converted into current metal.  I do

      know that there are many lodes in this section that surpass the

      Sheba in primal assay value.  Listen a moment to the calculations

      of the Sheba operators.  They purpose transporting the ore

      concentrated to Europe.  The conveyance from Star City (its

      locality) to Virginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton;

      from Virginia to San Francisco, forty dollars per ton; from

      thence to Liverpool, its destination, ten dollars per ton.  Their

      idea is that its conglomerate metals will reimburse them their

      cost of original extraction, the price of transportation, and the

      expense of reduction, and that then a ton of the raw ore will net

      them twelve hundred dollars.  The estimate may be extravagant.

      Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far transcending

      any previous developments of our racy Territory.



      A very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield

      five hundred dollars to the ton.  Such fecundity throws the Gould

      & Curry, the Ophir and the Mexican, of your neighborhood, in the

      darkest shadow.  I have given you the estimate of the value of a

      single developed mine.  Its richness is indexed by its market

      valuation.  The people of Humboldt county are feet crazy.  As I

      write, our towns are near deserted.  They look as languid as a

      consumptive girl.  What has become of our sinewy and athletic

      fellow-citizens?  They are coursing through ravines and over

      mountain tops.  Their tracks are visible in every direction.

      Occasionally a horseman will dash among us.  His steed betrays

      hard usage.  He alights before his adobe dwelling, hastily

      exchanges courtesies with his townsmen, hurries to an assay

      office and from thence to the District Recorder's.  In the

      morning, having renewed his provisional supplies, he is off again

      on his wild and unbeaten route.  Why, the fellow numbers already

      his feet by the thousands.  He is the horse-leech.  He has the

      craving stomach of the shark or anaconda.  He would conquer

      metallic worlds.



This was enough.  The instant we had finished reading the above article,

four of us decided to go to Humboldt.  We commenced getting ready at

once.  And we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not deciding

sooner--for we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be found and

secured before we got there, and we might have to put up with ledges that

would not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a ton, maybe.  An

hour before, I would have felt opulent if I had owned ten feet in a Gold

Hill mine whose ore produced twenty-five dollars to the ton; now I was

already annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with mines the

poorest of which would be a marvel in Gold Hill.









CHAPTER XXVII.



Hurry, was the word!  We wasted no time.  Our party consisted of four

persons--a blacksmith sixty years of age, two young lawyers, and myself.

We bought a wagon and two miserable old horses.  We put eighteen hundred

pounds of provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of

Carson on a chilly December afternoon.  The horses were so weak and old

that we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out

and walked.  It was an improvement.  Next, we found that it would be

better if a third man got out.  That was an improvement also.  It was at

this time that I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a

harnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt

fairly excused from such a responsibility.  But in a little while it was

found that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also.

It was at this time that I resigned the position of driver, and never

resumed it again.  Within the hour, we found that it would not only be

better, but was absolutely necessary, that we four, taking turns, two at

a time, should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it

through the sand, leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of

the way and hold up the tongue.  Perhaps it is well for one to know his

fate at first, and get reconciled to it.  We had learned ours in one

afternoon.  It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove

that wagon and those horses two hundred miles.  So we accepted the

situation, and from that time forth we never rode.  More than that, we

stood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind.



We made seven miles, and camped in the desert.  Young Clagett (now member

of Congress from Montana) unharnessed and fed and watered the horses;

Oliphant and I cut sagebrush, built the fire and brought water to cook

with; and old Mr. Ballou the blacksmith did the cooking.  This division

of labor, and this appointment, was adhered to throughout the journey.

We had no tent, and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain.  We

were so tired that we slept soundly.



We were fifteen days making the trip--two hundred miles; thirteen,

rather, for we lay by a couple of days, in one place, to let the horses

rest.



We could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had towed

the horses behind the wagon, but we did not think of that until it was

too late, and so went on shoving the horses and the wagon too when we

might have saved half the labor.  Parties who met us, occasionally,

advised us to put the horses in the wagon, but Mr. Ballou, through whose

iron-clad earnestness no sarcasm could pierce, said that that would not

do, because the provisions were exposed and would suffer, the horses

being "bituminous from long deprivation."  The reader will excuse me from

translating.  What Mr. Ballou customarily meant, when he used a long

word, was a secret between himself and his Maker.  He was one of the best

and kindest hearted men that ever graced a humble sphere of life.  He was

gentleness and simplicity itself--and unselfishness, too.  Although he

was more than twice as old as the eldest of us, he never gave himself any

airs, privileges, or exemptions on that account.  He did a young man's

share of the work; and did his share of conversing and entertaining from

the general stand-point of any age--not from the arrogant, overawing

summit-height of sixty years.  His one striking peculiarity was his

Partingtonian fashion of loving and using big words for their own sakes,

and independent of any bearing they might have upon the thought he was

purposing to convey.  He always let his ponderous syllables fall with an

easy unconsciousness that left them wholly without offensiveness.

In truth his air was so natural and so simple that one was always

catching himself accepting his stately sentences as meaning something,

when they really meant nothing in the world.  If a word was long and

grand and resonant, that was sufficient to win the old man's love, and he

would drop that word into the most out-of-the-way place in a sentence or

a subject, and be as pleased with it as if it were perfectly luminous

with meaning.



We four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the frozen

ground, and slept side by side; and finding that our foolish, long-legged

hound pup had a deal of animal heat in him, Oliphant got to admitting him

to the bed, between himself and Mr. Ballou, hugging the dog's warm back

to his breast and finding great comfort in it.  But in the night the pup

would get stretchy and brace his feet against the old man's back and

shove, grunting complacently the while; and now and then, being warm and

snug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old man's back simply in

excess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of the chase and

in his sleep tug at the old man's back hair and bark in his ear.  The old

gentleman complained mildly about these familiarities, at last, and when

he got through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not

a proper animal to admit to bed with tired men, because he was "so

meretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions."  We turned

the dog out.



It was a hard, wearing, toilsome journey, but it had its bright side; for

after each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper

of fried bacon, bread, molasses and black coffee, the pipe-smoking, song-

singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire in the still

solitudes of the desert was a happy, care-free sort of recreation that

seemed the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury.



It is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men, whether city or

country-bred.  We are descended from desert-lounging Arabs, and countless

ages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root out of us

the nomadic instinct.  We all confess to a gratified thrill at the

thought of "camping out."



Once we made twenty-five miles in a day, and once we made forty miles

(through the Great American Desert), and ten miles beyond--fifty in all--

in twenty-three hours, without halting to eat, drink or rest.  To stretch

out and go to sleep, even on stony and frozen ground, after pushing a

wagon and two horses fifty miles, is a delight so supreme that for the

moment it almost seems cheap at the price.



We camped two days in the neighborhood of the "Sink of the Humboldt."

We tried to use the strong alkaline water of the Sink, but it would not

answer.  It was like drinking lye, and not weak lye, either.  It left a

taste in the mouth, bitter and every way execrable, and a burning in the

stomach that was very uncomfortable.  We put molasses in it, but that

helped it very little; we added a pickle, yet the alkali was the

prominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking.



The coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet

invented.  It was really viler to the taste than the unameliorated water

itself.  Mr. Ballou, being the architect and builder of the beverage felt

constrained to endorse and uphold it, and so drank half a cup, by little

sips, making shift to praise it faintly the while, but finally threw out

the remainder, and said frankly it was "too technical for him."



But presently we found a spring of fresh water, convenient, and then,

with nothing to mar our enjoyment, and no stragglers to interrupt it, we

entered into our rest.









CHAPTER XXVIII.



After leaving the Sink, we traveled along the Humboldt river a little

way.  People accustomed to the monster mile-wide Mississippi, grow

accustomed to associating the term "river" with a high degree of watery

grandeur.  Consequently, such people feel rather disappointed when they

stand on the shores of the Humboldt or the Carson and find that a "river"

in Nevada is a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of the Erie

canal in all respects save that the canal is twice as long and four times

as deep.  One of the pleasantest and most invigorating exercises one can

contrive is to run and jump across the Humboldt river till he is

overheated, and then drink it dry.



On the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and

entered Unionville, Humboldt county, in the midst of a driving snow-

storm.  Unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a liberty-pole.  Six of

the cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon, and the other

five faced them.  The rest of the landscape was made up of bleak mountain

walls that rose so high into the sky from both sides of the canyon that

the village was left, as it were, far down in the bottom of a crevice.

It was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before the

darkness lifted and revealed Unionville.



We built a small, rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it

with canvas, leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney, through which

the cattle used to tumble occasionally, at night, and mash our furniture

and interrupt our sleep.  It was very cold weather and fuel was scarce.

Indians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs; and when

we could catch a laden Indian it was well--and when we could not (which

was the rule, not the exception), we shivered and bore it.



I confess, without shame, that I expected to find masses of silver lying

all about the ground.  I expected to see it glittering in the sun on the

mountain summits.  I said nothing about this, for some instinct told me

that I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it, and so if I

betrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself.  Yet I was as

perfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be of anything, that I was

going to gather up, in a day or two, or at furthest a week or two, silver

enough to make me satisfactorily wealthy--and so my fancy was already

busy with plans for spending this money.  The first opportunity that

offered, I sauntered carelessly away from the cabin, keeping an eye on

the other boys, and stopping and contemplating the sky when they seemed

to be observing me; but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear, I fled

away as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted till I was

far beyond sight and call.  Then I began my search with a feverish

excitement that was brimful of expectation--almost of certainty.

I crawled about the ground, seizing and examining bits of stone, blowing

the dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes, and then peering at

them with anxious hope.  Presently I found a bright fragment and my heart

bounded!  I hid behind a boulder and polished it and scrutinized it with

a nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than absolute

certainty itself could have afforded.  The more I examined the fragment

the more I was convinced that I had found the door to fortune.  I marked

the spot and carried away my specimen.  Up and down the rugged mountain

side I searched, with always increasing interest and always augmenting

gratitude that I had come to Humboldt and come in time.  Of all the

experiences of my life, this secret search among the hidden treasures of

silver-land was the nearest to unmarred ecstasy.  It was a delirious

revel.



By and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit of shining

yellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me!  A gold mine, and in my

simplicity I had been content with vulgar silver!  I was so excited that

I half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me.  Then a fear

came upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my secret.

Moved by this thought, I made a circuit of the place, and ascended a

knoll to reconnoiter.  Solitude.  No creature was near.  Then I returned

to my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment, but my

fears were groundless--the shining scales were still there.  I set about

scooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the

stream and robbed its bed.  But at last the descending sun warned me to

give up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth.  As I walked

along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over

my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose.  In

this little time the former had so fallen in my estimation that once or

twice I was on the point of throwing it away.



The boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat nothing.  Neither could

I talk.  I was full of dreams and far away.  Their conversation

interrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat, and annoyed me a little, too.

I despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about.  But as

they proceeded, it began to amuse me.  It grew to be rare fun to hear

them planning their poor little economies and sighing over possible

privations and distresses when a gold mine, all our own, lay within sight

of the cabin and I could point it out at any moment.  Smothered hilarity

began to oppress me, presently.  It was hard to resist the impulse to

burst out with exultation and reveal everything; but I did resist.  I

said within myself that I would filter the great news through my lips

calmly and be serene as a summer morning while I watched its effect in

their faces.  I said:



"Where have you all been?"



"Prospecting."



"What did you find?"



"Nothing."



"Nothing?  What do you think of the country?"



"Can't tell, yet," said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold miner, and had

likewise had considerable experience among the silver mines.



"Well, haven't you formed any sort of opinion?"



"Yes, a sort of a one.  It's fair enough here, may be, but overrated.

Seven thousand dollar ledges are scarce, though.



"That Sheba may be rich enough, but we don't own it; and besides, the rock

is so full of base metals that all the science in the world can't work

it.  We'll not starve, here, but we'll not get rich, I'm afraid."



"So you think the prospect is pretty poor?"



"No name for it!"



"Well, we'd better go back, hadn't we?"



"Oh, not yet--of course not.  We'll try it a riffle, first."



"Suppose, now--this is merely a supposition, you know--suppose you could

find a ledge that would yield, say, a hundred and fifty dollars a ton--

would that satisfy you?"



"Try us once!" from the whole party.



"Or suppose--merely a supposition, of course--suppose you were to find a

ledge that would yield two thousand dollars a ton--would that satisfy

you?"



"Here--what do you mean?  What are you coming at?  Is there some mystery

behind all this?"



"Never mind.  I am not saying anything.  You know perfectly well there

are no rich mines here--of course you do.  Because you have been around

and examined for yourselves.  Anybody would know that, that had been

around.  But just for the sake of argument, suppose--in a kind of general

way--suppose some person were to tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges

were simply contemptible--contemptible, understand--and that right yonder

in sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure

silver--oceans of it--enough to make you all rich in twenty-four hours!

Come!"



"I should say he was as crazy as a loon!" said old Ballou, but wild with

excitement, nevertheless.



"Gentlemen," said I, "I don't say anything--I haven't been around, you

know, and of course don't know anything--but all I ask of you is to cast

your eye on that, for instance, and tell me what you think of it!" and I

tossed my treasure before them.



There was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of heads together over

it under the candle-light.  Then old Ballou said:



"Think of it?  I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and

nasty glittering mica that isn't worth ten cents an acre!"



So vanished my dream.  So melted my wealth away.  So toppled my airy

castle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn.



Moralizing, I observed, then, that "all that glitters is not gold."



Mr. Ballou said I could go further than that, and lay it up among my

treasures of knowledge, that nothing that glitters is gold.  So I learned

then, once for all, that gold in its native state is but dull,

unornamental stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the admiration

of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter.  However, like the rest of

the world, I still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of

mica.  Commonplace human nature cannot rise above that.









CHAPTER XXIX.



True knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough.  We went

out "prospecting" with Mr. Ballou.  We climbed the mountain sides, and

clambered among sage-brush, rocks and snow till we were ready to drop

with exhaustion, but found no silver--nor yet any gold.  Day after day we

did this.  Now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the

declivities and apparently abandoned; and now and then we found one or

two listless men still burrowing.  But there was no appearance of silver.

These holes were the beginnings of tunnels, and the purpose was to drive

them hundreds of feet into the mountain, and some day tap the hidden

ledge where the silver was.  Some day!  It seemed far enough away, and

very hopeless and dreary.  Day after day we toiled, and climbed and

searched, and we younger partners grew sicker and still sicker of the

promiseless toil.  At last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock

which projected from the earth high upon the mountain.  Mr. Ballou broke

off some fragments with a hammer, and examined them long and attentively

with a small eye-glass; threw them away and broke off more; said this

rock was quartz, and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver.

Contained it!  I had thought that at least it would be caked on the

outside of it like a kind of veneering.  He still broke off pieces and

critically examined them, now and then wetting the piece with his tongue

and applying the glass.  At last he exclaimed:



"We've got it!"



We were full of anxiety in a moment.  The rock was clean and white, where

it was broken, and across it ran a ragged thread of blue.  He said that

that little thread had silver in it, mixed with base metal, such as lead

and antimony, and other rubbish, and that there was a speck or two of

gold visible.  After a great deal of effort we managed to discern some

little fine yellow specks, and judged that a couple of tons of them

massed together might make a gold dollar, possibly.  We were not

jubilant, but Mr. Ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than

that.  He saved what he called the "richest" piece of the rock, in order

to determine its value by the process called the "fire-assay."  Then we

named the mine "Monarch of the Mountains" (modesty of nomenclature is not

a prominent feature in the mines), and Mr. Ballou wrote out and stuck up

the following "notice," preserving a copy to be entered upon the books in

the mining recorder's office in the town.



      "NOTICE."



      "We the undersigned claim three claims, of three hundred feet each

      (and one for discovery), on this silver-bearing quartz lead or lode,

      extending north and south from this notice, with all its dips,

      spurs, and angles, variations and sinuosities, together with fifty

      feet of ground on either side for working the same."



We put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made.

But when we talked the matter all over with Mr. Ballou, we felt depressed

and dubious.  He said that this surface quartz was not all there was of

our mine; but that the wall or ledge of rock called the "Monarch of the

Mountains," extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet into the earth--

he illustrated by saying it was like a curb-stone, and maintained a

nearly uniform thickness-say twenty feet--away down into the bowels of

the earth, and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on each side

of it; and that it kept to itself, and maintained its distinctive

character always, no matter how deep it extended into the earth or how

far it stretched itself through and across the hills and valleys.  He

said it might be a mile deep and ten miles long, for all we knew; and

that wherever we bored into it above ground or below, we would find gold

and silver in it, but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was cased

between.  And he said that down in the great depths of the ledge was its

richness, and the deeper it went the richer it grew.  Therefore, instead

of working here on the surface, we must either bore down into the rock

with a shaft till we came to where it was rich--say a hundred feet or so

--or else we must go down into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the

mountain side and tap the ledge far under the earth.  To do either was

plainly the labor of months; for we could blast and bore only a few feet

a day--some five or six.  But this was not all.  He said that after we

got the ore out it must be hauled in wagons to a distant silver-mill,

ground up, and the silver extracted by a tedious and costly process.  Our

fortune seemed a century away!



But we went to work.  We decided to sink a shaft.  So, for a week we

climbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, crowbars, shovels,

cans of blasting powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main.

At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and

threw it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well.  But the

rock became more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into

play.  But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder.



That was the weariest work!  One of us held the iron drill in its place

and another would strike with an eight-pound sledge--it was like driving

nails on a large scale.  In the course of an hour or two the drill would

reach a depth of two or three feet, making a hole a couple of inches in

diameter.  We would put in a charge of powder, insert half a yard of

fuse, pour in sand and gravel and ram it down, then light the fuse and

run.  When the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air,

we would go back and find about a bushel of that hard, rebellious quartz

jolted out.  Nothing more.  One week of this satisfied me.  I resigned.

Clagget and Oliphant followed.  Our shaft was only twelve feet deep.  We

decided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted.



So we went down the mountain side and worked a week; at the end of which

time we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in, and

judged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the ledge.

I resigned again, and the other boys only held out one day longer.

We decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted.  We wanted a ledge that

was already "developed."  There were none in the camp.



We dropped the "Monarch" for the time being.



Meantime the camp was filling up with people, and there was a constantly

growing excitement about our Humboldt mines.  We fell victims to the

epidemic and strained every nerve to acquire more "feet."  We prospected

and took up new claims, put "notices" on them and gave them grandiloquent

names.  We traded some of our "feet" for "feet" in other people's claims.

In a little while we owned largely in the "Gray Eagle," the "Columbiana,"

the "Branch Mint," the "Maria Jane," the "Universe," the "Root-Hog-or-

Die," the "Samson and Delilah," the "Treasure Trove," the "Golconda," the

"Sultana," the "Boomerang," the "Great Republic," the "Grand Mogul," and

fifty other "mines" that had never been molested by a shovel or scratched

with a pick.  We had not less than thirty thousand "feet" apiece in the

"richest mines on earth" as the frenzied cant phrased it--and were in

debt to the butcher.  We were stark mad with excitement--drunk with

happiness--smothered under mountains of prospective wealth--arrogantly

compassionate toward the plodding millions who knew not our marvellous

canyon--but our credit was not good at the grocer's.



It was the strangest phase of life one can imagine.  It was a beggars'

revel.  There was nothing doing in the district--no mining--no milling--

no productive effort--no income--and not enough money in the entire camp

to buy a corner lot in an eastern village, hardly; and yet a stranger

would have supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires.

Prospecting parties swarmed out of town with the first flush of dawn, and

swarmed in again at nightfall laden with spoil--rocks.  Nothing but

rocks.  Every man's pockets were full of them; the floor of his cabin was

littered with them; they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves.









CHAPTER XXX.



I met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand

"feet" in undeveloped silver mines, every single foot of which they

believed would shortly be worth from fifty to a thousand dollars--and as

often as any other way they were men who had not twenty-five dollars in

the world.  Every man you met had his new mine to boast of, and his

"specimens" ready; and if the opportunity offered, he would infallibly

back you into a corner and offer as a favor to you, not to him, to part

with just a few feet in the "Golden Age," or the "Sarah Jane," or some

other unknown stack of croppings, for money enough to get a "square meal"

with, as the phrase went.  And you were never to reveal that he had made

you the offer at such a ruinous price, for it was only out of friendship

for you that he was willing to make the sacrifice.  Then he would fish a

piece of rock out of his pocket, and after looking mysteriously around as

if he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in

his possession, he would dab the rock against his tongue, clap an

eyeglass to it, and exclaim:



"Look at that!  Right there in that red dirt!  See it?  See the specks of

gold?  And the streak of silver?  That's from the Uncle Abe.  There's a

hundred thousand tons like that in sight!  Right in sight, mind you!

And when we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid, it will be the

richest thing in the world!  Look at the assay!  I don't want you to

believe me--look at the assay!"



Then he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the

portion of rock assayed had given evidence of containing silver and gold

in the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands of dollars to the ton.





I little knew, then, that the custom was to hunt out the richest piece of

rock and get it assayed!  Very often, that piece, the size of a filbert,

was the only fragment in a ton that had a particle of metal in it--and

yet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton

of rubbish it came from!



On such a system of assaying as that, the Humboldt world had gone crazy.

On the authority of such assays its newspaper correspondents were

frothing about rock worth four and seven thousand dollars a ton!



And does the reader remember, a few pages back, the calculations, of a

quoted correspondent, whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the

way to England, the metals extracted, and the gold and silver contents

received back by the miners as clear profit, the copper, antimony and

other things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses

incurred?  Everybody's head was full of such "calculations" as those--

such raving insanity, rather.  Few people took work into their

calculations--or outlay of money either; except the work and expenditures

of other people.



We never touched our tunnel or our shaft again.  Why?  Because we judged

that we had learned the real secret of success in silver mining--which

was, not to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our brows and the

labor of our hands, but to sell the ledges to the dull slaves of toil and

let them do the mining!



Before leaving Carson, the Secretary and I had purchased "feet" from

various Esmeralda stragglers.  We had expected immediate returns of

bullion, but were only afflicted with regular and constant "assessments"

instead--demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines.  These

assessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into

the matter personally.  Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson and

thence to Esmeralda.  I bought a horse and started, in company with

Mr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff, a Prussian--not the party

who has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched

foreign grammars, with their interminable repetitions of questions which

never have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation

among human beings.  We rode through a snow-storm for two or three days,

and arrived at "Honey Lake Smith's," a sort of isolated inn on the Carson

river.  It was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in the

midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson winds

its melancholy way.  Close to the house were the Overland stage stables,

built of sun-dried bricks.  There was not another building within several

leagues of the place.  Towards sunset about twenty hay-wagons arrived and

camped around the house and all the teamsters came in to supper--a very,

very rough set.  There were one or two Overland stage drivers there,

also, and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers; consequently the house

was well crowded.



We walked out, after supper, and visited a small Indian camp in the

vicinity.  The Indians were in a great hurry about something, and were

packing up and getting away as fast as they could.  In their broken

English they said, "By'm-by, heap water!" and by the help of signs made

us understand that in their opinion a flood was coming.  The weather was

perfectly clear, and this was not the rainy season.  There was about a

foot of water in the insignificant river--or maybe two feet; the stream

was not wider than a back alley in a village, and its banks were scarcely

higher than a man's head.



So, where was the flood to come from?  We canvassed the subject awhile

and then concluded it was a ruse, and that the Indians had some better

reason for leaving in a hurry than fears of a flood in such an

exceedingly dry time.



At seven in the evening we went to bed in the second story--with our

clothes on, as usual, and all three in the same bed, for every available

space on the floors, chairs, etc., was in request, and even then there

was barely room for the housing of the inn's guests.  An hour later we

were awakened by a great turmoil, and springing out of bed we picked our

way nimbly among the ranks of snoring teamsters on the floor and got to

the front windows of the long room.  A glance revealed a strange

spectacle, under the moonlight.  The crooked Carson was full to the brim,

and its waters were raging and foaming in the wildest way--sweeping

around the sharp bends at a furious speed, and bearing on their surface a

chaos of logs, brush and all sorts of rubbish.  A depression, where its

bed had once been, in other times, was already filling, and in one or two

places the water was beginning to wash over the main bank.  Men were

flying hither and thither, bringing cattle and wagons close up to the

house, for the spot of high ground on which it stood extended only some

thirty feet in front and about a hundred in the rear.  Close to the old

river bed just spoken of, stood a little log stable, and in this our

horses were lodged.



While we looked, the waters increased so fast in this place that in a few

minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin

encroaching steadily on the logs.  We suddenly realized that this flood

was not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the

small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river,

for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations

and invading the great hay-corral adjoining.  We ran down and joined the

crowd of excited men and frightened animals.  We waded knee-deep into the

log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so

fast the waters increased.  Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-

corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll the

bales up on the high ground by the house.  Meantime it was discovered

that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large

stable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed,

awoke him, and waded out again.  But Owens was drowsy and resumed his

nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed,

his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water!

It was up level with the mattress!  He waded out, breast-deep, almost,

and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the

big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.



At eleven o'clock only the roof of the little log stable was out of

water, and our inn was on an island in mid-ocean.  As far as the eye

could reach, in the moonlight, there was no desert visible, but only a

level waste of shining water.  The Indians were true prophets, but how

did they get their information?  I am not able to answer the question.

We remained cooped up eight days and nights with that curious crew.

Swearing, drinking and card playing were the order of the day, and

occasionally a fight was thrown in for variety.  Dirt and vermin--but let

us forget those features; their profusion is simply inconceivable--it is

better that they remain so.



There were two men----however, this chapter is long enough.









CHAPTER XXXI.



There were two men in the company who caused me particular discomfort.

One was a little Swede, about twenty-five years old, who knew only one

song, and he was forever singing it.  By day we were all crowded into one

small, stifling bar-room, and so there was no escaping this person's

music.  Through all the profanity, whisky-guzzling, "old sledge" and

quarreling, his monotonous song meandered with never a variation in its

tiresome sameness, and it seemed to me, at last, that I would be content

to die, in order to be rid of the torture.  The other man was a stalwart

ruffian called "Arkansas," who carried two revolvers in his belt and a

bowie knife projecting from his boot, and who was always drunk and always

suffering for a fight.  But he was so feared, that nobody would

accommodate him.  He would try all manner of little wary ruses to entrap

somebody into an offensive remark, and his face would light up now and

then when he fancied he was fairly on the scent of a fight, but

invariably his victim would elude his toils and then he would show a

disappointment that was almost pathetic.  The landlord, Johnson, was a

meek, well-meaning fellow, and Arkansas fastened on him early, as a

promising subject, and gave him no rest day or night, for awhile.  On the

fourth morning, Arkansas got drunk and sat himself down to wait for an

opportunity.  Presently Johnson came in, just comfortably sociable with

whisky, and said:



"I reckon the Pennsylvania 'lection--"



Arkansas raised his finger impressively and Johnson stopped.  Arkansas

rose unsteadily and confronted him.  Said he:



"Wha-what do you know a--about Pennsylvania?  Answer me that.  Wha--what

do you know 'bout Pennsylvania?"



"I was only goin' to say--"



"You was only goin' to say.  You was!  You was only goin' to say--what

was you goin' to say?  That's it!  That's what I want to know.  I want to

know wha--what you ('ic) what you know about Pennsylvania, since you're

makin' yourself so d---d free.  Answer me that!"



"Mr. Arkansas, if you'd only let me--"



"Who's a henderin' you?  Don't you insinuate nothing agin me!--don't you

do it.  Don't you come in here bullyin' around, and cussin' and goin' on

like a lunatic--don't you do it.  'Coz I won't stand it.  If fight's what

you want, out with it!  I'm your man!  Out with it!"



Said Johnson, backing into a corner, Arkansas following, menacingly:



"Why, I never said nothing, Mr. Arkansas.  You don't give a man no

chance.  I was only goin' to say that Pennsylvania was goin' to have an

election next week--that was all--that was everything I was goin' to say

--I wish I may never stir if it wasn't."



"Well then why d'n't you say it?  What did you come swellin' around that

way for, and tryin' to raise trouble?"



"Why I didn't come swellin' around, Mr. Arkansas--I just--"



"I'm a liar am I!  Ger-reat Caesar's ghost--"



"Oh, please, Mr. Arkansas, I never meant such a thing as that, I wish I

may die if I did.  All the boys will tell you that I've always spoke well

of you, and respected you more'n any man in the house.  Ask Smith.  Ain't

it so, Smith?  Didn't I say, no longer ago than last night, that for a

man that was a gentleman all the time and every way you took him, give me

Arkansas?  I'll leave it to any gentleman here if them warn't the very

words I used.  Come, now, Mr. Arkansas, le's take a drink--le's shake

hands and take a drink.  Come up--everybody!  It's my treat.  Come up,

Bill, Tom, Bob, Scotty--come up.  I want you all to take a drink with me

and Arkansas--old Arkansas, I call him--bully old Arkansas.  Gimme your

hand agin.  Look at him, boys--just take a look at him.  Thar stands the

whitest man in America!--and the man that denies it has got to fight me,

that's all.  Gimme that old flipper agin!"



They embraced, with drunken affection on the landlord's part and

unresponsive toleration on the part of Arkansas, who, bribed by a drink,

was disappointed of his prey once more.  But the foolish landlord was so

happy to have escaped butchery, that he went on talking when he ought to

have marched himself out of danger.  The consequence was that Arkansas

shortly began to glower upon him dangerously, and presently said:



"Lan'lord, will you p-please make that remark over agin if you please?"



"I was a-sayin' to Scotty that my father was up'ards of eighty year old

when he died."



"Was that all that you said?"



"Yes, that was all."



"Didn't say nothing but that?"



"No--nothing."



Then an uncomfortable silence.



Arkansas played with his glass a moment, lolling on his elbows on the

counter.  Then he meditatively scratched his left shin with his right

boot, while the awkward silence continued.  But presently he loafed away

toward the stove, looking dissatisfied; roughly shouldered two or three

men out of a comfortable position; occupied it himself, gave a sleeping

dog a kick that sent him howling under a bench, then spread his long legs

and his blanket-coat tails apart and proceeded to warm his back.  In a

little while he fell to grumbling to himself, and soon he slouched back

to the bar and said:



"Lan'lord, what's your idea for rakin' up old personalities and blowin'

about your father?  Ain't this company agreeable to you?  Ain't it?  If

this company ain't agreeable to you, p'r'aps we'd better leave.  Is that

your idea?  Is that what you're coming at?"



"Why bless your soul, Arkansas, I warn't thinking of such a thing.  My

father and my mother--"



"Lan'lord, don't crowd a man!  Don't do it.  If nothing'll do you but a

disturbance, out with it like a man ('ic)--but don't rake up old bygones

and fling'em in the teeth of a passel of people that wants to be

peaceable if they could git a chance.  What's the matter with you this

mornin', anyway?  I never see a man carry on so."



"Arkansas, I reely didn't mean no harm, and I won't go on with it if it's

onpleasant to you.  I reckon my licker's got into my head, and what with

the flood, and havin' so many to feed and look out for--"



"So that's what's a-ranklin' in your heart, is it?  You want us to leave

do you?  There's too many on us.  You want us to pack up and swim.  Is

that it?  Come!"



"Please be reasonable, Arkansas.  Now you know that I ain't the man to--"



"Are you a threatenin' me?  Are you?  By George, the man don't live that

can skeer me!  Don't you try to come that game, my chicken--'cuz I can

stand a good deal, but I won't stand that.  Come out from behind that bar

till I clean you!  You want to drive us out, do you, you sneakin'

underhanded hound!  Come out from behind that bar!  I'll learn you to

bully and badger and browbeat a gentleman that's forever trying to

befriend you and keep you out of trouble!"



"Please, Arkansas, please don't shoot!  If there's got to be bloodshed--"



"Do you hear that, gentlemen?  Do you hear him talk about bloodshed?  So

it's blood you want, is it, you ravin' desperado!  You'd made up your

mind to murder somebody this mornin'--I knowed it perfectly well.  I'm

the man, am I?  It's me you're goin' to murder, is it?  But you can't do

it 'thout I get one chance first, you thievin' black-hearted, white-

livered son of a nigger!  Draw your weepon!"



With that, Arkansas began to shoot, and the landlord to clamber over

benches, men and every sort of obstacle in a frantic desire to escape.

In the midst of the wild hubbub the landlord crashed through a glass

door, and as Arkansas charged after him the landlord's wife suddenly

appeared in the doorway and confronted the desperado with a pair of

scissors!  Her fury was magnificent.  With head erect and flashing eye

she stood a moment and then advanced, with her weapon raised.  The

astonished ruffian hesitated, and then fell back a step.  She followed.

She backed him step by step into the middle of the bar-room, and then,

while the wondering crowd closed up and gazed, she gave him such another

tongue-lashing as never a cowed and shamefaced braggart got before,

perhaps!  As she finished and retired victorious, a roar of applause

shook the house, and every man ordered "drinks for the crowd" in one and

the same breath.



The lesson was entirely sufficient.  The reign of terror was over, and

the Arkansas domination broken for good.  During the rest of the season

of island captivity, there was one man who sat apart in a state of

permanent humiliation, never mixing in any quarrel or uttering a boast,

and never resenting the insults the once cringing crew now constantly

leveled at him, and that man was "Arkansas."



By the fifth or sixth morning the waters had subsided from the land, but

the stream in the old river bed was still high and swift and there was no

possibility of crossing it.  On the eighth it was still too high for an

entirely safe passage, but life in the inn had become next to

insupportable by reason of the dirt, drunkenness, fighting, etc., and so

we made an effort to get away.  In the midst of a heavy snow-storm we

embarked in a canoe, taking our saddles aboard and towing our horses

after us by their halters.  The Prussian, Ollendorff, was in the bow,

with a paddle, Ballou paddled in the middle, and I sat in the stern

holding the halters.  When the horses lost their footing and began to

swim, Ollendorff got frightened, for there was great danger that the

horses would make our aim uncertain, and it was plain that if we failed

to land at a certain spot the current would throw us off and almost

surely cast us into the main Carson, which was a boiling torrent, now.

Such a catastrophe would be death, in all probability, for we would be

swept to sea in the "Sink" or overturned and drowned.  We warned

Ollendorff to keep his wits about him and handle himself carefully, but

it was useless; the moment the bow touched the bank, he made a spring and

the canoe whirled upside down in ten-foot water.



Ollendorff seized some brush and dragged himself ashore, but Ballou and I

had to swim for it, encumbered with our overcoats.  But we held on to the

canoe, and although we were washed down nearly to the Carson, we managed

to push the boat ashore and make a safe landing.  We were cold and water-

soaked, but safe.  The horses made a landing, too, but our saddles were

gone, of course.  We tied the animals in the sage-brush and there they

had to stay for twenty-four hours.  We baled out the canoe and ferried

over some food and blankets for them, but we slept one more night in the

inn before making another venture on our journey.



The next morning it was still snowing furiously when we got away with our

new stock of saddles and accoutrements.  We mounted and started.  The

snow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign of a road

perceptible, and the snow-fall was so thick that we could not see more

than a hundred yards ahead, else we could have guided our course by the

mountain ranges.  The case looked dubious, but Ollendorff said his

instinct was as sensitive as any compass, and that he could "strike a

bee-line" for Carson city and never diverge from it.  He said that if he

were to straggle a single point out of the true line his instinct would

assail him like an outraged conscience.  Consequently we dropped into his

wake happy and content.  For half an hour we poked along warily enough,

but at the end of that time we came upon a fresh trail, and Ollendorff

shouted proudly:



"I knew I was as dead certain as a compass, boys!  Here we are, right in

somebody's tracks that will hunt the way for us without any trouble.

Let's hurry up and join company with the party."



So we put the horses into as much of a trot as the deep snow would allow,

and before long it was evident that we were gaining on our predecessors,

for the tracks grew more distinct.  We hurried along, and at the end of

an hour the tracks looked still newer and fresher--but what surprised us

was, that the number of travelers in advance of us seemed to steadily

increase.  We wondered how so large a party came to be traveling at such

a time and in such a solitude.  Somebody suggested that it must be a

company of soldiers from the fort, and so we accepted that solution and

jogged along a little faster still, for they could not be far off now.

But the tracks still multiplied, and we began to think the platoon of

soldiers was miraculously expanding into a regiment--Ballou said they had

already increased to five hundred!  Presently he stopped his horse and

said:



"Boys, these are our own tracks, and we've actually been circussing round

and round in a circle for more than two hours, out here in this blind

desert!  By George this is perfectly hydraulic!"



Then the old man waxed wroth and abusive.  He called Ollendorff all

manner of hard names--said he never saw such a lurid fool as he was, and

ended with the peculiarly venomous opinion that he "did not know as much

as a logarythm!"



We certainly had been following our own tracks.  Ollendorff and his

"mental compass" were in disgrace from that moment.



After all our hard travel, here we were on the bank of the stream again,

with the inn beyond dimly outlined through the driving snow-fall.  While

we were considering what to do, the young Swede landed from the canoe and

took his pedestrian way Carson-wards, singing his same tiresome song

about his "sister and his brother" and "the child in the grave with its

mother," and in a short minute faded and disappeared in the white

oblivion.  He was never heard of again.  He no doubt got bewildered and

lost, and Fatigue delivered him over to Sleep and Sleep betrayed him to

Death.  Possibly he followed our treacherous tracks till he became

exhausted and dropped.



Presently the Overland stage forded the now fast receding stream and

started toward Carson on its first trip since the flood came.  We

hesitated no longer, now, but took up our march in its wake, and trotted

merrily along, for we had good confidence in the driver's bump of

locality.  But our horses were no match for the fresh stage team.  We

were soon left out of sight; but it was no matter, for we had the deep

ruts the wheels made for a guide.  By this time it was three in the

afternoon, and consequently it was not very long before night came--and

not with a lingering twilight, but with a sudden shutting down like a

cellar door, as is its habit in that country.  The snowfall was still as

thick as ever, and of course we could not see fifteen steps before us;

but all about us the white glare of the snow-bed enabled us to discern

the smooth sugar-loaf mounds made by the covered sage-bushes, and just in

front of us the two faint grooves which we knew were the steadily filling

and slowly disappearing wheel-tracks.



Now those sage-bushes were all about the same height--three or four feet;

they stood just about seven feet apart, all over the vast desert; each of

them was a mere snow-mound, now; in any direction that you proceeded (the

same as in a well laid out orchard) you would find yourself moving down a

distinctly defined avenue, with a row of these snow-mounds an either side

of it--an avenue the customary width of a road, nice and level in its

breadth, and rising at the sides in the most natural way, by reason of

the mounds.  But we had not thought of this.  Then imagine the chilly

thrill that shot through us when it finally occurred to us, far in the

night, that since the last faint trace of the wheel-tracks had long ago

been buried from sight, we might now be wandering down a mere sage-brush

avenue, miles away from the road and diverging further and further away

from it all the time.  Having a cake of ice slipped down one's back is

placid comfort compared to it.  There was a sudden leap and stir of blood

that had been asleep for an hour, and as sudden a rousing of all the

drowsing activities in our minds and bodies.  We were alive and awake at

once--and shaking and quaking with consternation, too.  There was an

instant halting and dismounting, a bending low and an anxious scanning of

the road-bed.  Useless, of course; for if a faint depression could not be

discerned from an altitude of four or five feet above it, it certainly

could not with one's nose nearly against it.









CHAPTER XXXII.



We seemed to be in a road, but that was no proof.  We tested this by

walking off in various directions--the regular snow-mounds and the

regular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the

true road, and that the others had found only false ones.  Plainly the

situation was desperate.  We were cold and stiff and the horses were

tired.  We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning.

This was wise, because if we were wandering from the right road and the

snow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to

hopeless if we kept on.



All agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us,

now, and so we set about building it.  We could find no matches, and so

we tried to make shift with the pistols.  Not a man in the party had ever

tried to do such a thing before, but not a man in the party doubted that

it could be done, and without any trouble--because every man in the party

had read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to believe

it, with trusting simplicity, just as he had long ago accepted and

believed that other common book-fraud about Indians and lost hunters

making a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together.



We huddled together on our knees in the deep snow, and the horses put

their noses together and bowed their patient heads over us; and while the

feathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white statuary,

we proceeded with the momentous experiment.  We broke twigs from a sage

bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter of our

bodies.  In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready, and then,

while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious suspense,

Ollendorff applied his revolver, pulled the trigger and blew the pile

clear out of the county!  It was the flattest failure that ever was.



This was distressing, but it paled before a greater horror--the horses

were gone!  I had been appointed to hold the bridles, but in my absorbing

anxiety over the pistol experiment I had unconsciously dropped them and

the released animals had walked off in the storm.  It was useless to try

to follow them, for their footfalls could make no sound, and one could

pass within two yards of the creatures and never see them.  We gave them

up without an effort at recovering them, and cursed the lying books that

said horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship

in a distressful time like ours.



We were miserable enough, before; we felt still more forlorn, now.

Patiently, but with blighted hope, we broke more sticks and piled them,

and once more the Prussian shot them into annihilation.  Plainly, to

light a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience,

and the middle of a desert at midnight in a snow-storm was not a good

place or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment.  We gave it up and

tried the other.  Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing

them together.  At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled,

and so were the sticks.  We bitterly execrated the Indians, the hunters

and the books that had betrayed us with the silly device, and wondered

dismally what was next to be done.  At this critical moment Mr. Ballou

fished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket.  To

have found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck

compared to this.



One cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstances--or how

lovable and precious, and sacredly beautiful to the eye.  This time we

gathered sticks with high hopes; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light

the first match, there was an amount of interest centred upon him that

pages of writing could not describe.  The match burned hopefully a

moment, and then went out.  It could not have carried more regret with it

if it had been a human life.  The next match simply flashed and died.

The wind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of

success.  We gathered together closer than ever, and developed a

solicitude that was rapt and painful, as Mr. Ballou scratched our last

hope on his leg.  It lit, burned blue and sickly, and then budded into a

robust flame.  Shading it with his hands, the old gentleman bent

gradually down and every heart went with him--everybody, too, for that

matter--and blood and breath stood still.  The flame touched the sticks

at last, took gradual hold upon them--hesitated--took a stronger hold--

hesitated again--held its breath five heart-breaking seconds, then gave a

sort of human gasp and went out.



Nobody said a word for several minutes.  It was a solemn sort of silence;

even the wind put on a stealthy, sinister quiet, and made no more noise

than the falling flakes of snow.  Finally a sad-voiced conversation

began, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the

conviction that this was our last night with the living.  I had so hoped

that I was the only one who felt so.  When the others calmly acknowledged

their conviction, it sounded like the summons itself.  Ollendorff said:



"Brothers, let us die together.  And let us go without one hard feeling

towards each other.  Let us forget and forgive bygones.  I know that you

have felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe, and for knowing too

much and leading you round and round in the snow--but I meant well;

forgive me.  I acknowledge freely that I have had hard feelings against

Mr. Ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm, which is a thing I

do not know what, but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and

unbecoming in America, and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has

hurt me a great deal--but let it go; I forgive Mr. Ballou with all my

heart, and--"



Poor Ollendorff broke down and the tears came.  He was not alone, for I

was crying too, and so was Mr. Ballou.  Ollendorff got his voice again

and forgave me for things I had done and said.  Then he got out his

bottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never

touch another drop.  He said he had given up all hope of life, and

although ill-prepared, was ready to submit humbly to his fate; that he

wished he could be spared a little longer, not for any selfish reason,

but to make a thorough reform in his character, and by devoting himself

to helping the poor, nursing the sick, and pleading with the people to

guard themselves against the evils of intemperance, make his life a

beneficent example to the young, and lay it down at last with the

precious reflection that it had not been lived in vain.  He ended by

saying that his reform should begin at this moment, even here in the

presence of death, since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to

prosecute it to men's help and benefit--and with that he threw away the

bottle of whisky.



Mr. Ballou made remarks of similar purport, and began the reform he could

not live to continue, by throwing away the ancient pack of cards that had

solaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable.



He said he never gambled, but still was satisfied that the meddling with

cards in any way was immoral and injurious, and no man could be wholly

pure and blemishless without eschewing them.  "And therefore," continued

he, "in doing this act I already feel more in sympathy with that

spiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform."  These

rolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have

done, and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with

satisfaction.



My own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades, and I know

that the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere.  We were

all sincere, and all deeply moved and earnest, for we were in the

presence of death and without hope.  I threw away my pipe, and in doing

it felt that at last I was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden

me like a tyrant all my days.  While I yet talked, the thought of the

good I might have done in the world and the still greater good I might

now do, with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide me

if I could only be spared a few years longer, overcame me and the tears

came again.  We put our arms about each other's necks and awaited the

warning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing.



It came stealing over us presently, and then we bade each other a last

farewell.  A delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding

senses, while the snow-flakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered

body.  Oblivion came.  The battle of life was done.









CHAPTER XXXIII.



I do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness, but it seemed

an age.  A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees, and then came a

gathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body.  I

shuddered.  The thought flitted through my brain, "this is death--this is

the hereafter."



Then came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with bitterness:



"Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?"



It was Ballou--at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture,

with Ballou's voice.



I rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were

the frame buildings of a stage station, and under a shed stood our still

saddled and bridled horses!



An arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and

the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word.

We really had nothing to say.  We were like the profane man who could not

"do the subject justice," the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous

and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to

commence anyhow.



The joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned; well-nigh

dissipated, indeed.  We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and

sullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at

everything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and

in unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses, unsaddled them,

and sought shelter in the station.



I have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd

adventure.  It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it.  We actually

went into camp in a snow-drift in a desert, at midnight in a storm,

forlorn and hopeless, within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn.



For two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust.

The mystery was gone, now, and it was plain enough why the horses had

deserted us.  Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a

minute after they had left us, and they must have overheard and enjoyed

all our confessions and lamentations.



After breakfast we felt better, and the zest of life soon came back.

The world looked bright again, and existence was as dear to us as ever.

Presently an uneasiness came over me--grew upon me--assailed me without

ceasing.  Alas, my regeneration was not complete--I wanted to smoke!

I resisted with all my strength, but the flesh was weak.  I wandered away

alone and wrestled with myself an hour.  I recalled my promises of reform

and preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively.  But it

was all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts

hunting for my pipe.  I discovered it after a considerable search, and

crept away to hide myself and enjoy it.  I remained behind the barn a

good while, asking myself how I would feel if my braver, stronger, truer

comrades should catch me in my degradation.  At last I lit the pipe, and

no human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then.  I was ashamed

of being in my own pitiful company.  Still dreading discovery, I felt

that perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer, and so

I turned the corner.  As I turned the one corner, smoking, Ollendorff

turned the other with his bottle to his lips, and between us sat

unconscious Ballou deep in a game of "solitaire" with the old greasy

cards!



Absurdity could go no farther.  We shook hands and agreed to say no more

about "reform" and "examples to the rising generation."



The station we were at was at the verge of the Twenty-six-Mile Desert.

If we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before, we must

have heard men shouting there and firing pistols; for they were expecting

some sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would infallibly

get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by sounds.



While we remained at the station, three of the drovers arrived, nearly

exhausted with their wanderings, but two others of their party were never

heard of afterward.



We reached Carson in due time, and took a rest.  This rest, together with

preparations for the journey to Esmeralda, kept us there a week, and the

delay gave us the opportunity to be present at the trial of the great

land-slide case of Hyde vs. Morgan--an episode which is famous in Nevada

to this day.  After a word or two of necessary explanation, I will set

down the history of this singular affair just as it transpired.









CHAPTER XXXIV.



The mountains are very high and steep about Carson, Eagle and Washoe

Valleys--very high and very steep, and so when the snow gets to melting

off fast in the Spring and the warm surface-earth begins to moisten and

soften, the disastrous land-slides commence.  The reader cannot know what

a land-slide is, unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole

side of a mountain taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the

valley, leaving a vast, treeless, unsightly scar upon the mountain's

front to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he

may go on living within seventy miles of that place.



General Buncombe was shipped out to Nevada in the invoice of Territorial

officers, to be United States Attorney.  He considered himself a lawyer

of parts, and he very much wanted an opportunity to manifest it--partly

for the pure gratification of it and partly because his salary was

Territorially meagre (which is a strong expression).  Now the older

citizens of a new territory look down upon the rest of the world with a

calm, benevolent compassion, as long as it keeps out of the way--when it

gets in the way they snub it.  Sometimes this latter takes the shape of a

practical joke.



One morning Dick Hyde rode furiously up to General Buncombe's door in

Carson city and rushed into his presence without stopping to tie his

horse.  He seemed much excited.  He told the General that he wanted him

to conduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundred dollars if he

achieved a victory.  And then, with violent gestures and a world of

profanity, he poured out his grief.  He said it was pretty well known

that for some years he had been farming (or ranching as the more

customary term is) in Washoe District, and making a successful thing of

it, and furthermore it was known that his ranch was situated just in the

edge of the valley, and that Tom Morgan owned a ranch immediately above

it on the mountain side.



And now the trouble was, that one of those hated and dreaded land-slides

had come and slid Morgan's ranch, fences, cabins, cattle, barns and

everything down on top of his ranch and exactly covered up every single

vestige of his property, to a depth of about thirty-eight feet.  Morgan

was in possession and refused to vacate the premises--said he was

occupying his own cabin and not interfering with anybody else's--and said

the cabin was standing on the same dirt and same ranch it had always

stood on, and he would like to see anybody make him vacate.



"And when I reminded him," said Hyde, weeping, "that it was on top of my

ranch and that he was trespassing, he had the infernal meanness to ask me

why didn't I stay on my ranch and hold possession when I see him

a-coming!  Why didn't I stay on it, the blathering lunatic--by George,

when I heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the

whole world was a-ripping and a-tearing down that mountain side--

splinters, and cord-wood, thunder and lightning, hail and snow, odds and

ends of hay stacks, and awful clouds of dust!--trees going end over end

in the air, rocks as big as a house jumping 'bout a thousand feet high

and busting into ten million pieces, cattle turned inside out and

a-coming head on with their tails hanging out between their teeth!--and

in the midst of all that wrack and destruction sot that cussed Morgan on

his gate-post, a-wondering why I didn't stay and hold possession!  Laws

bless me, I just took one glimpse, General, and lit out'n the county in

three jumps exactly.



"But what grinds me is that that Morgan hangs on there and won't move

off'n that ranch--says it's his'n and he's going to keep it--likes it

better'n he did when it was higher up the hill.  Mad!  Well, I've been so

mad for two days I couldn't find my way to town--been wandering around in

the brush in a starving condition--got anything here to drink, General?

But I'm here now, and I'm a-going to law.  You hear me!"



Never in all the world, perhaps, were a man's feelings so outraged as

were the General's.  He said he had never heard of such high-handed

conduct in all his life as this Morgan's.  And he said there was no use

in going to law--Morgan had no shadow of right to remain where he was--

nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it, and no lawyer would take

his case and no judge listen to it.  Hyde said that right there was where

he was mistaken--everybody in town sustained Morgan; Hal Brayton, a very

smart lawyer, had taken his case; the courts being in vacation, it was to

be tried before a referee, and ex-Governor Roop had already been

appointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall

near the hotel at two that afternoon.



The General was amazed.  He said he had suspected before that the people

of that Territory were fools, and now he knew it.  But he said rest easy,

rest easy and collect the witnesses, for the victory was just as certain

as if the conflict were already over.  Hyde wiped away his tears and

left.



At two in the afternoon referee Roop's Court opened and Roop appeared

throned among his sheriffs, the witnesses, and spectators, and wearing

upon his face a solemnity so awe-inspiring that some of his fellow-

conspirators had misgivings that maybe he had not comprehended, after

all, that this was merely a joke.  An unearthly stillness prevailed, for

at the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the command:



"Order in the Court!"



And the sheriffs promptly echoed it.  Presently the General elbowed his

way through the crowd of spectators, with his arms full of law-books, and

on his ears fell an order from the judge which was the first respectful

recognition of his high official dignity that had ever saluted them, and

it trickled pleasantly through his whole system:



"Way for the United States Attorney!"



The witnesses were called--legislators, high government officers,

ranchmen, miners, Indians, Chinamen, negroes.  Three fourths of them were

called by the defendant Morgan, but no matter, their testimony invariably

went in favor of the plaintiff Hyde.  Each new witness only added new

testimony to the absurdity of a man's claiming to own another man's

property because his farm had slid down on top of it.  Then the Morgan

lawyers made their speeches, and seemed to make singularly weak ones--

they did really nothing to help the Morgan cause.  And now the General,

with exultation in his face, got up and made an impassioned effort; he

pounded the table, he banged the law-books, he shouted, and roared, and

howled, he quoted from everything and everybody, poetry, sarcasm,

statistics, history, pathos, bathos, blasphemy, and wound up with a grand

war-whoop for free speech, freedom of the press, free schools, the

Glorious Bird of America and the principles of eternal justice!

[Applause.]



When the General sat down, he did it with the conviction that if there

was anything in good strong testimony, a great speech and believing and

admiring countenances all around, Mr. Morgan's case was killed.  Ex-

Governor Roop leant his head upon his hand for some minutes, thinking,

and the still audience waited for his decision.  Then he got up and stood

erect, with bended head, and thought again.  Then he walked the floor

with long, deliberate strides, his chin in his hand, and still the

audience waited.  At last he returned to his throne, seated himself, and

began impressively:



"Gentlemen, I feel the great responsibility that rests upon me this day.

This is no ordinary case.  On the contrary it is plain that it is the

most solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide.

Gentlemen, I have listened attentively to the evidence, and have

perceived that the weight of it, the overwhelming weight of it, is in

favor of the plaintiff Hyde.  I have listened also to the remarks of

counsel, with high interest--and especially will I commend the masterly

and irrefutable logic of the distinguished gentleman who represents the

plaintiff.  But gentlemen, let us beware how we allow mere human

testimony, human ingenuity in argument and human ideas of equity, to

influence us at a moment so solemn as this.  Gentlemen, it ill becomes

us, worms as we are, to meddle with the decrees of Heaven.  It is plain

to me that Heaven, in its inscrutable wisdom, has seen fit to move this

defendant's ranch for a purpose.  We are but creatures, and we must

submit.  If Heaven has chosen to favor the defendant Morgan in this

marked and wonderful manner; and if Heaven, dissatisfied with the

position of the Morgan ranch upon the mountain side, has chosen to remove

it to a position more eligible and more advantageous for its owner, it

ill becomes us, insects as we are, to question the legality of the act or

inquire into the reasons that prompted it.  No--Heaven created the

ranches and it is Heaven's prerogative to rearrange them, to experiment

with them around at its pleasure.  It is for us to submit, without

repining.



"I warn you that this thing which has happened is a thing with which the

sacrilegious hands and brains and tongues of men must not meddle.

Gentlemen, it is the verdict of this court that the plaintiff, Richard

Hyde, has been deprived of his ranch by the visitation of God!  And from

this decision there is no appeal."



Buncombe seized his cargo of law-books and plunged out of the court-room

frantic with indignation.  He pronounced Roop to be a miraculous fool, an

inspired idiot.  In all good faith he returned at night and remonstrated

with Roop upon his extravagant decision, and implored him to walk the

floor and think for half an hour, and see if he could not figure out some

sort of modification of the verdict.  Roop yielded at last and got up to

walk.  He walked two hours and a half, and at last his face lit up

happily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch

underneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to Hyde, that his title to

the ground was just as good as it had ever been, and therefore he was of

opinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from under there and--



The General never waited to hear the end of it.  He was always an

impatient and irascible man, that way.  At the end of two months the fact

that he had been played upon with a joke had managed to bore itself, like

another Hoosac Tunnel, through the solid adamant of his understanding.









CHAPTER XXXV.



When we finally left for Esmeralda, horseback, we had an addition to the

company in the person of Capt. John Nye, the Governor's brother.  He had

a good memory, and a tongue hung in the middle.  This is a combination

which gives immortality to conversation.  Capt. John never suffered the

talk to flag or falter once during the hundred and twenty miles of the

journey.  In addition to his conversational powers, he had one or two

other endowments of a marked character.  One was a singular "handiness"

about doing anything and everything, from laying out a railroad or

organizing a political party, down to sewing on buttons, shoeing a horse,

or setting a broken leg, or a hen.  Another was a spirit of accommodation

that prompted him to take the needs, difficulties and perplexities of

anybody and everybody upon his own shoulders at any and all times, and

dispose of them with admirable facility and alacrity--hence he always

managed to find vacant beds in crowded inns, and plenty to eat in the

emptiest larders.  And finally, wherever he met a man, woman or child, in

camp, inn or desert, he either knew such parties personally or had been

acquainted with a relative of the same.  Such another traveling comrade

was never seen before.  I cannot forbear giving a specimen of the way in

which he overcame difficulties.  On the second day out, we arrived, very

tired and hungry, at a poor little inn in the desert, and were told that

the house was full, no provisions on hand, and neither hay nor barley to

spare for the horses--must move on.  The rest of us wanted to hurry on

while it was yet light, but Capt. John insisted on stopping awhile.

We dismounted and entered.  There was no welcome for us on any face.

Capt. John began his blandishments, and within twenty minutes he had

accomplished the following things, viz.: found old acquaintances in three

teamsters; discovered that he used to go to school with the landlord's

mother; recognized his wife as a lady whose life he had saved once in

California, by stopping her runaway horse; mended a child's broken toy

and won the favor of its mother, a guest of the inn; helped the hostler

bleed a horse, and prescribed for another horse that had the "heaves";

treated the entire party three times at the landlord's bar; produced a

later paper than anybody had seen for a week and sat himself down to read

the news to a deeply interested audience.  The result, summed up, was as

follows: The hostler found plenty of feed for our horses; we had a trout

supper, an exceedingly sociable time after it, good beds to sleep in, and

a surprising breakfast in the morning--and when we left, we left lamented

by all!  Capt. John had some bad traits, but he had some uncommonly

valuable ones to offset them with.



Esmeralda was in many respects another Humboldt, but in a little more

forward state.  The claims we had been paying assessments on were

entirely worthless, and we threw them away.  The principal one cropped

out of the top of a knoll that was fourteen feet high, and the inspired

Board of Directors were running a tunnel under that knoll to strike the

ledge.  The tunnel would have to be seventy feet long, and would then

strike the ledge at the same dept that a shaft twelve feet deep would

have reached!  The Board were living on the "assessments."  [N.B.--This

hint comes too late for the enlightenment of New York silver miners; they

have already learned all about this neat trick by experience.]  The Board

had no desire to strike the ledge, knowing that it was as barren of

silver as a curbstone.  This reminiscence calls to mind Jim Townsend's

tunnel.  He had paid assessments on a mine called the "Daley" till he was

well-nigh penniless.  Finally an assessment was levied to run a tunnel

two hundred and fifty feet on the Daley, and Townsend went up on the hill

to look into matters.



He found the Daley cropping out of the apex of an exceedingly sharp-

pointed peak, and a couple of men up there "facing" the proposed tunnel.

Townsend made a calculation.  Then he said to the men:



"So you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred

and fifty feet to strike this ledge?"



"Yes, sir."



"Well, do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and

arduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man?"



"Why no--how is that?"



"Because this hill is only twenty-five feet through from side to side;

and so you have got to build two hundred and twenty-five feet of your

tunnel on trestle-work!"



The ways of silver mining Boards are exceedingly dark and sinuous.



We took up various claims, and commenced shafts and tunnels on them, but

never finished any of them.  We had to do a certain amount of work on

each to "hold" it, else other parties could seize our property after the

expiration of ten days.  We were always hunting up new claims and doing a

little work on them and then waiting for a buyer--who never came.  We

never found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton; and

as the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for working ore and extracting

the silver, our pocket-money melted steadily away and none returned to

take its place.  We lived in a little cabin and cooked for ourselves; and

altogether it was a hard life, though a hopeful one--for we never ceased

to expect fortune and a customer to burst upon us some day.



At last, when flour reached a dollar a pound, and money could not be

borrowed on the best security at less than eight per cent a month (I

being without the security, too), I abandoned mining and went to milling.

That is to say, I went to work as a common laborer in a quartz mill, at

ten dollars a week and board.









CHAPTER XXXVI.



I had already learned how hard and long and dismal a task it is to burrow

down into the bowels of the earth and get out the coveted ore; and now I

learned that the burrowing was only half the work; and that to get the

silver out of the ore was the dreary and laborious other half of it.

We had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark.

This mill was a six-stamp affair, driven by steam.  Six tall, upright

rods of iron, as large as a man's ankle, and heavily shod with a mass of

iron and steel at their lower ends, were framed together like a gate, and

these rose and fell, one after the other, in a ponderous dance, in an

iron box called a "battery."  Each of these rods or stamps weighed six

hundred pounds.  One of us stood by the battery all day long, breaking up

masses of silver-bearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the

battery.  The ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to

powder, and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it to

a creamy paste.  The minutest particles were driven through a fine wire

screen which fitted close around the battery, and were washed into great

tubs warmed by super-heated steam--amalgamating pans, they are called.

The mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by revolving

"mullers."  A quantity of quicksilver was kept always in the battery, and

this seized some of the liberated gold and silver particles and held on

to them; quicksilver was shaken in a fine shower into the pans, also,

about every half hour, through a buckskin sack.  Quantities of coarse

salt and sulphate of copper were added, from time to time to assist the

amalgamation by destroying base metals which coated the gold and silver

and would not let it unite with the quicksilver.



All these tiresome things we had to attend to constantly.  Streams of

dirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad

wooden troughs to the ravine.  One would not suppose that atoms of gold

and silver would float on top of six inches of water, but they did; and

in order to catch them, coarse blankets were laid in the troughs, and

little obstructing "riffles" charged with quicksilver were placed here

and there across the troughs also.  These riffles had to be cleaned and

the blankets washed out every evening, to get their precious

accumulations--and after all this eternity of trouble one third of the

silver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way to the end of the

troughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day.

There is nothing so aggravating as silver milling.  There never was any

idle time in that mill.  There was always something to do.  It is a pity

that Adam could not have gone straight out of Eden into a quartz mill, in

order to understand the full force of his doom to "earn his bread by the

sweat of his brow."  Every now and then, during the day, we had to scoop

some pulp out of the pans, and tediously "wash" it in a horn spoon--wash

it little by little over the edge till at last nothing was left but some

little dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom.  If they were soft and

yielding, the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of copper or some

other chemical rubbish to assist digestion; if they were crisp to the

touch and would retain a dint, they were freighted with all the silver

and gold they could seize and hold, and consequently the pan needed a

fresh charge of quicksilver.  When there was nothing else to do, one

could always "screen tailings."  That is to say, he could shovel up the

dried sand that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs and

dash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbles and

prepare it for working over.



The process of amalgamation differed in the various mills, and this

included changes in style of pans and other machinery, and a great

diversity of opinion existed as to the best in use, but none of the

methods employed, involved the principle of milling ore without

"screening the tailings."  Of all recreations in the world, screening

tailings on a hot day, with a long-handled shovel, is the most

undesirable.



At the end of the week the machinery was stopped and we "cleaned up."

That is to say, we got the pulp out of the pans and batteries, and washed

the mud patiently away till nothing was left but the long accumulating

mass of quicksilver, with its imprisoned treasures.  This we made into

heavy, compact snow-balls, and piled them up in a bright, luxurious heap

for inspection.  Making these snow-balls cost me a fine gold ring--that

and ignorance together; for the quicksilver invaded the ring with the

same facility with which water saturates a sponge--separated its

particles and the ring crumbled to pieces.



We put our pile of quicksilver balls into an iron retort that had a pipe

leading from it to a pail of water, and then applied a roasting heat.

The quicksilver turned to vapor, escaped through the pipe into the pail,

and the water turned it into good wholesome quicksilver again.

Quicksilver is very costly, and they never waste it.  On opening the

retort, there was our week's work--a lump of pure white, frosty looking

silver, twice as large as a man's head.  Perhaps a fifth of the mass was

gold, but the color of it did not show--would not have shown if two

thirds of it had been gold.  We melted it up and made a solid brick of it

by pouring it into an iron brick-mould.



By such a tedious and laborious process were silver bricks obtained.

This mill was but one of many others in operation at the time.  The first

one in Nevada was built at Egan Canyon and was a small insignificant

affair and compared most unfavorably with some of the immense

establishments afterwards located at Virginia City and elsewhere.



From our bricks a little corner was chipped off for the "fire-assay"--a

method used to determine the proportions of gold, silver and base metals

in the mass.  This is an interesting process.  The chip is hammered out

as thin as paper and weighed on scales so fine and sensitive that if you

weigh a two-inch scrap of paper on them and then write your name on the

paper with a course, soft pencil and weigh it again, the scales will take

marked notice of the addition.



Then a little lead (also weighed) is rolled up with the flake of silver

and the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a cupel,

made by compressing bone ashes into a cup-shape in a steel mold.  The

base metals oxydize and are absorbed with the lead into the pores of the

cupel.  A button or globule of perfectly pure gold and silver is left

behind, and by weighing it and noting the loss, the assayer knows the

proportion of base metal the brick contains.  He has to separate the gold

from the silver now.  The button is hammered out flat and thin, put in

the furnace and kept some time at a red heat; after cooling it off it is

rolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric

acid; the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready to

be weighed on its own merits.  Then salt water is poured into the vessel

containing the dissolved silver and the silver returns to palpable form

again and sinks to the bottom.  Nothing now remains but to weigh it; then

the proportions of the several metals contained in the brick are known,

and the assayer stamps the value of the brick upon its surface.



The sagacious reader will know now, without being told, that the

speculative miner, in getting a "fire-assay" made of a piece of rock from

his mine (to help him sell the same), was not in the habit of picking out

the least valuable fragment of rock on his dump-pile, but quite the

contrary.  I have seen men hunt over a pile of nearly worthless quartz

for an hour, and at last find a little piece as large as a filbert, which

was rich in gold and silver--and this was reserved for a fire-assay!  Of

course the fire-assay would demonstrate that a ton of such rock would

yield hundreds of dollars--and on such assays many an utterly worthless

mine was sold.



Assaying was a good business, and so some men engaged in it,

occasionally, who were not strictly scientific and capable.  One assayer

got such rich results out of all specimens brought to him that in time he

acquired almost a monopoly of the business.  But like all men who achieve

success, he became an object of envy and suspicion.  The other assayers

entered into a conspiracy against him, and let some prominent citizens

into the secret in order to show that they meant fairly.  Then they broke

a little fragment off a carpenter's grindstone and got a stranger to take

it to the popular scientist and get it assayed.  In the course of an hour

the result came--whereby it appeared that a ton of that rock would yield

$1,184.40 in silver and $366.36 in gold!



Due publication of the whole matter was made in the paper, and the

popular assayer left town "between two days."



I will remark, in passing, that I only remained in the milling business

one week.  I told my employer I could not stay longer without an advance

in my wages; that I liked quartz milling, indeed was infatuated with it;

that I had never before grown so tenderly attached to an occupation in so

short a time; that nothing, it seemed to me, gave such scope to

intellectual activity as feeding a battery and screening tailings, and

nothing so stimulated the moral attributes as retorting bullion and

washing blankets--still, I felt constrained to ask an increase of salary.

He said he was paying me ten dollars a week, and thought it a good round

sum.  How much did I want?



I said about four hundred thousand dollars a month, and board, was about

all I could reasonably ask, considering the hard times.



I was ordered off the premises!  And yet, when I look back to those days

and call to mind the exceeding hardness of the labor I performed in that

mill, I only regret that I did not ask him seven hundred thousand.



Shortly after this I began to grow crazy, along with the rest of the

population, about the mysterious and wonderful "cement mine," and to make

preparations to take advantage of any opportunity that might offer to go

and help hunt for it.









CHAPTER XXXVII.



It was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that the marvellous

Whiteman cement mine was supposed to lie.  Every now and then it would be

reported that Mr. W. had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of

night, in disguise, and then we would have a wild excitement--because he

must be steering for his secret mine, and now was the time to follow him.

In less than three hours after daylight all the horses and mules and

donkeys in the vicinity would be bought, hired or stolen, and half the

community would be off for the mountains, following in the wake of

Whiteman.  But W. would drift about through the mountain gorges for days

together, in a purposeless sort of way, until the provisions of the

miners ran out, and they would have to go back home.  I have known it

reported at eleven at night, in a large mining camp, that Whiteman had

just passed through, and in two hours the streets, so quiet before, would

be swarming with men and animals.  Every individual would be trying to be

very secret, but yet venturing to whisper to just one neighbor that W.

had passed through.  And long before daylight--this in the dead of

Winter--the stampede would be complete, the camp deserted, and the whole

population gone chasing after W.



The tradition was that in the early immigration, more than twenty years

ago, three young Germans, brothers, who had survived an Indian massacre

on the Plains, wandered on foot through the deserts, avoiding all trails

and roads, and simply holding a westerly direction and hoping to find

California before they starved, or died of fatigue.  And in a gorge in

the mountains they sat down to rest one day, when one of them noticed a

curious vein of cement running along the ground, shot full of lumps of

dull yellow metal.  They saw that it was gold, and that here was a

fortune to be acquired in a single day.  The vein was about as wide as a

curbstone, and fully two thirds of it was pure gold.  Every pound of the

wonderful cement was worth well-nigh $200.



Each of the brothers loaded himself with about twenty-five pounds of it,

and then they covered up all traces of the vein, made a rude drawing of

the locality and the principal landmarks in the vicinity, and started

westward again.  But troubles thickened about them.  In their wanderings

one brother fell and broke his leg, and the others were obliged to go on

and leave him to die in the wilderness.  Another, worn out and starving,

gave up by and by, and laid down to die, but after two or three weeks of

incredible hardships, the third reached the settlements of California

exhausted, sick, and his mind deranged by his sufferings.  He had thrown

away all his cement but a few fragments, but these were sufficient to set

everybody wild with excitement.  However, he had had enough of the cement

country, and nothing could induce him to lead a party thither.  He was

entirely content to work on a farm for wages.  But he gave Whiteman his

map, and described the cement region as well as he could and thus

transferred the curse to that gentleman--for when I had my one accidental

glimpse of Mr. W. in Esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine, in

hunger and thirst, poverty and sickness, for twelve or thirteen years.

Some people believed he had found it, but most people believed he had

not.  I saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have

been given to Whiteman by the young German, and it was of a seductive

nature.  Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice

of fruit cake.  The privilege of working such a mine one week would be

sufficient for a man of reasonable desires.



A new partner of ours, a Mr. Higbie, knew Whiteman well by sight, and a

friend of ours, a Mr. Van Dorn, was well acquainted with him, and not

only that, but had Whiteman's promise that he should have a private hint

in time to enable him to join the next cement expedition.  Van Dorn had

promised to extend the hint to us.  One evening Higbie came in greatly

excited, and said he felt certain he had recognized Whiteman, up town,

disguised and in a pretended state of intoxication.  In a little while

Van Dorn arrived and confirmed the news; and so we gathered in our cabin

and with heads close together arranged our plans in impressive whispers.



We were to leave town quietly, after midnight, in two or three small

parties, so as not to attract attention, and meet at dawn on the "divide"

overlooking Mono Lake, eight or nine miles distant.  We were to make no

noise after starting, and not speak above a whisper under any

circumstances.  It was believed that for once Whiteman's presence was

unknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected.  Our conclave broke

up at nine o'clock, and we set about our preparation diligently and with

profound secrecy.  At eleven o'clock we saddled our horses, hitched them

with their long riatas (or lassos), and then brought out a side of bacon,

a sack of beans, a small sack of coffee, some sugar, a hundred pounds of

flour in sacks, some tin cups and a coffee pot, frying pan and some few

other necessary articles.  All these things were "packed" on the back of

a led horse--and whoever has not been taught, by a Spanish adept, to pack

an animal, let him never hope to do the thing by natural smartness.  That

is impossible.  Higbie had had some experience, but was not perfect.  He

put on the pack saddle (a thing like a saw-buck), piled the property on

it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under it, "every which

way," taking a hitch in it every now and then, and occasionally surging

back on it till the horse's sides sunk in and he gasped for breath--but

every time the lashings grew tight in one place they loosened in another.

We never did get the load tight all over, but we got it so that it would

do, after a fashion, and then we started, in single file, close order,

and without a word.  It was a dark night.  We kept the middle of the

road, and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows of cabins, and whenever

a miner came to his door I trembled for fear the light would shine on us

an excite curiosity.  But nothing happened.  We began the long winding

ascent of the canyon, toward the "divide," and presently the cabins began

to grow infrequent, and the intervals between them wider and wider, and

then I began to breathe tolerably freely and feel less like a thief and a

murderer.  I was in the rear, leading the pack horse.  As the ascent grew

steeper he grew proportionately less satisfied with his cargo, and began

to pull back on his riata occasionally and delay progress.  My comrades

were passing out of sight in the gloom.  I was getting anxious.  I coaxed

and bullied the pack horse till I presently got him into a trot, and then

the tin cups and pans strung about his person frightened him and he ran.

His riata was wound around the pummel of my saddle, and so, as he went by

he dragged me from my horse and the two animals traveled briskly on

without me.  But I was not alone--the loosened cargo tumbled overboard

from the pack horse and fell close to me.  It was abreast of almost the

last cabin.



A miner came out and said:



"Hello!"



I was thirty steps from him, and knew he could not see me, it was so very

dark in the shadow of the mountain.  So I lay still.  Another head

appeared in the light of the cabin door, and presently the two men walked

toward me.  They stopped within ten steps of me, and one said:



"Sh!  Listen."



I could not have been in a more distressed state if I had been escaping

justice with a price on my head.  Then the miners appeared to sit down on

a boulder, though I could not see them distinctly enough to be very sure

what they did.  One said:



"I heard a noise, as plain as I ever heard anything.  It seemed to be

about there--"



A stone whizzed by my head.  I flattened myself out in the dust like a

postage stamp, and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little

he would probably hear another noise.  In my heart, now, I execrated

secret expeditions.  I promised myself that this should be my last,

though the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins.  Then one of the men

said:



"I'll tell you what!  Welch knew what he was talking about when he said

he saw Whiteman to-day.  I heard horses--that was the noise.  I am going

down to Welch's, right away."



They left and I was glad.  I did not care whither they went, so they

went.  I was willing they should visit Welch, and the sooner the better.



As soon as they closed their cabin door my comrades emerged from the

gloom; they had caught the horses and were waiting for a clear coast

again.  We remounted the cargo on the pack horse and got under way, and

as day broke we reached the "divide" and joined Van Dorn.  Then we

journeyed down into the valley of the Lake, and feeling secure, we halted

to cook breakfast, for we were tired and sleepy and hungry.  Three hours

later the rest of the population filed over the "divide" in a long

procession, and drifted off out of sight around the borders of the Lake!



Whether or not my accident had produced this result we never knew, but at

least one thing was certain--the secret was out and Whiteman would not

enter upon a search for the cement mine this time.  We were filled with

chagrin.



We held a council and decided to make the best of our misfortune and

enjoy a week's holiday on the borders of the curious Lake.  Mono, it is

sometimes called, and sometimes the "Dead Sea of California."  It is one

of the strangest freaks of Nature to be found in any land, but it is

hardly ever mentioned in print and very seldom visited, because it lies

away off the usual routes of travel and besides is so difficult to get at

that only men content to endure the roughest life will consent to take

upon themselves the discomforts of such a trip.  On the morning of our

second day, we traveled around to a remote and particularly wild spot on

the borders of the Lake, where a stream of fresh, ice-cold water entered

it from the mountain side, and then we went regularly into camp.  We

hired a large boat and two shot-guns from a lonely ranchman who lived

some ten miles further on, and made ready for comfort and recreation.

We soon got thoroughly acquainted with the Lake and all its

peculiarities.









CHAPTER XXXVIII.



Mono Lake lies in a lifeless, treeless, hideous desert, eight thousand

feet above the level of the sea, and is guarded by mountains two thousand

feet higher, whose summits are always clothed in clouds.  This solemn,

silent, sail-less sea--this lonely tenant of the loneliest spot on earth

--is little graced with the picturesque.  It is an unpretending expanse

of grayish water, about a hundred miles in circumference, with two

islands in its centre, mere upheavals of rent and scorched and blistered

lava, snowed over with gray banks and drifts of pumice-stone and ashes,

the winding sheet of the dead volcano, whose vast crater the lake has

seized upon and occupied.



The lake is two hundred feet deep, and its sluggish waters are so strong

with alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly soiled garment into

them once or twice, and wring it out, it will be found as clean as if it

had been through the ablest of washerwomen's hands.  While we camped

there our laundry work was easy.  We tied the week's washing astern of

our boat, and sailed a quarter of a mile, and the job was complete, all

to the wringing out.  If we threw the water on our heads and gave them a

rub or so, the white lather would pile up three inches high.  This water

is not good for bruised places and abrasions of the skin.  We had a

valuable dog.  He had raw places on him.  He had more raw places on him

than sound ones.  He was the rawest dog I almost ever saw.  He jumped

overboard one day to get away from the flies.  But it was bad judgment.

In his condition, it would have been just as comfortable to jump into the

fire.



The alkali water nipped him in all the raw places simultaneously, and he

struck out for the shore with considerable interest.  He yelped and

barked and howled as he went--and by the time he got to the shore there

was no bark to him--for he had barked the bark all out of his inside, and

the alkali water had cleaned the bark all off his outside, and he

probably wished he had never embarked in any such enterprise.  He ran

round and round in a circle, and pawed  the earth and clawed the air, and

threw double somersaults, sometimes backward and sometimes forward, in

the most extraordinary manner.  He was not a demonstrative dog, as a

general thing, but rather of a grave and serious turn of mind, and I

never saw him take so much interest in anything before.  He finally

struck out over the mountains, at a gait which we estimated at about two

hundred and fifty miles an hour, and he is going yet.  This was about

nine years ago.  We look for what is left of him along here every day.



A white man cannot drink the water of Mono Lake, for it is nearly pure

lye.  It is said that the Indians in the vicinity drink it sometimes,

though.  It is not improbable, for they are among the purest liars I ever

saw.  [There will be no additional charge for this joke, except to

parties requiring an explanation of it.  This joke has received high

commendation from some of the ablest minds of the age.]



There are no fish in Mono Lake--no frogs, no snakes, no polliwigs--

nothing, in fact, that goes to make life desirable.  Millions of wild

ducks and sea-gulls swim about the surface, but no living thing exists

under the surface, except a white feathery sort of worm, one half an inch

long, which looks like a bit of white thread frayed out at the sides.  If

you dip up a gallon of water, you will get about fifteen thousand of

these.  They give to the water a sort of grayish-white appearance.  Then

there is a fly, which looks something like our house fly.  These settle

on the beach to eat the worms that wash ashore--and any time, you can see

there a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide, and this belt

extends clear around the lake--a belt of flies one hundred miles long.

If you throw a stone among them, they swarm up so thick that they look

dense, like a cloud.  You can hold them under water as long as you

please--they do not mind it--they are only proud of it.  When you let

them go, they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report, and

walk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially with a

view to affording instructive entertainment to man in that particular

way.  Providence leaves nothing to go by chance.  All things have their

uses and their part and proper place in Nature's economy: the ducks eat

the flies--the flies eat the worms--the Indians eat all three--the wild

cats eat the Indians--the white folks eat the wild cats--and thus all

things are lovely.



Mono Lake is a hundred miles in a straight line from the ocean--and

between it and the ocean are one or two ranges of mountains--yet

thousands of sea-gulls go there every season to lay their eggs and rear

their young.  One would as soon expect to find sea-gulls in Kansas.

And in this connection let us observe another instance of Nature's

wisdom.  The islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava, coated

over with ashes and pumice-stone, and utterly innocent of vegetation or

anything that would burn; and sea-gull's eggs being entirely useless to

anybody unless they be cooked, Nature has provided an unfailing spring of

boiling water on the largest island, and you can put your eggs in there,

and in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement I have

made during the past fifteen years.  Within ten feet of the boiling

spring is a spring of pure cold water, sweet and wholesome.



So, in that island you get your board and washing free of charge--and if

nature had gone further and furnished a nice American hotel clerk who was

crusty and disobliging, and didn't know anything about the time tables,

or the railroad routes--or--anything--and was proud of it--I would not

wish for a more desirable boarding-house.



Half a dozen little mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake, but not a stream

of any kind flows out of it.  It neither rises nor falls, apparently, and

what it does with its surplus water is a dark and bloody mystery.



There are only two seasons in the region round about Mono Lake--and these

are, the breaking up of one Winter and the beginning of the next.  More

than once (in Esmeralda) I have seen a perfectly blistering morning open

up with the thermometer at ninety degrees at eight o'clock, and seen the

snow fall fourteen inches deep and that same identical thermometer go

down to forty-four degrees under shelter, before nine o'clock at night.

Under favorable circumstances it snows at least once in every single

month in the year, in the little town of Mono.  So uncertain is the

climate in Summer that a lady who goes out visiting cannot hope to be

prepared for all emergencies unless she takes her fan under one arm and

her snow shoes under the other.  When they have a Fourth of July

procession it generally snows on them, and they do say that as a general

thing when a man calls for a brandy toddy there, the bar keeper chops it

off with a hatchet and wraps it up in a paper, like maple sugar.  And it

is further reported that the old soakers haven't any teeth--wore them out

eating gin cocktails and brandy punches.  I do not endorse that

statement--I simply give it for what it is worth--and it is worth--well,

I should say, millions, to any man who can believe it without straining

himself.  But I do endorse the snow on the Fourth of July--because I know

that to be true.









CHAPTER XXXIX.



About seven o'clock one blistering hot morning--for it was now dead

summer time--Higbie and I took the boat and started on a voyage of

discovery to the two islands.  We had often longed to do this, but had

been deterred by the fear of storms; for they were frequent, and severe

enough to capsize an ordinary row-boat like ours without great

difficulty--and once capsized, death would ensue in spite of the bravest

swimming, for that venomous water would eat a man's eyes out like fire,

and burn him out inside, too, if he shipped a sea.  It was called twelve

miles, straight out to the islands--a long pull and a warm one--but the

morning was so quiet and sunny, and the lake so smooth and glassy and

dead, that we could not resist the temptation.  So we filled two large

tin canteens with water (since we were not acquainted with the locality

of the spring said to exist on the large island), and started.  Higbie's

brawny muscles gave the boat good speed, but by the time we reached our

destination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than

twelve.



We landed on the big island and went ashore.  We tried the water in the

canteens, now, and found that the sun had spoiled it; it was so brackish

that we could not drink it; so we poured it out and began a search for

the spring--for thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent that one

has no means at hand of quenching it.  The island was a long, moderately

high hill of ashes--nothing but gray ashes and pumice-stone, in which we

sunk to our knees at every step--and all around the top was a forbidding

wall of scorched and blasted rocks.  When we reached the top and got

within the wall, we found simply a shallow, far-reaching basin, carpeted

with ashes, and here and there a patch of fine sand.  In places,

picturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices, giving evidence that

although this ancient crater had gone out of active business, there was

still some fire left in its furnaces.  Close to one of these jets of

steam stood the only tree on the island--a small pine of most graceful

shape and most faultless symmetry; its color was a brilliant green, for

the steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always

moist.  It contrasted strangely enough, did this vigorous and beautiful

outcast, with its dead and dismal surroundings.  It was like a cheerful

spirit in a mourning household.



We hunted for the spring everywhere, traversing the full length of the

island (two or three miles), and crossing it twice--climbing ash-hills

patiently, and then sliding down the other side in a sitting posture,

plowing up smothering volumes of gray dust.  But we found nothing but

solitude, ashes and a heart-breaking silence.  Finally we noticed that

the wind had risen, and we forgot our thirst in a solicitude of greater

importance; for, the lake being quiet, we had not taken pains about

securing the boat.  We hurried back to a point overlooking our landing

place, and then--but mere words cannot describe our dismay--the boat was

gone!  The chances were that there was not another boat on the entire

lake.  The situation was not comfortable--in truth, to speak plainly, it

was frightful.  We were prisoners on a desolate island, in aggravating

proximity to friends who were for the present helpless to aid us; and

what was still more uncomfortable was the reflection that we had neither

food nor water.  But presently we sighted the boat.  It was drifting

along, leisurely, about fifty yards from shore, tossing in a foamy sea.

It drifted, and continued to drift, but at the same safe distance from

land, and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us.

At the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape, and Higbie ran ahead

and posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault.  If

we failed there, there was no hope for us.  It was driving gradually

shoreward all the time, now; but whether it was driving fast enough to

make the connection or not was the momentous question.  When it got

within thirty steps of Higbie I was so excited that I fancied I could

hear my own heart beat.  When, a little later, it dragged slowly along

and seemed about to go by, only one little yard out of reach, it seemed

as if my heart stood still; and when it was exactly abreast him and began

to widen away, and he still standing like a watching statue, I knew my

heart did stop.  But when he gave a great spring, the next instant, and

lit fairly in the stern, I discharged a war-whoop that woke the

solitudes!



But it dulled my enthusiasm, presently, when he told me he had not been

caring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not, so that it

passed within eight or ten yards of him, for he had made up his mind to

shut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance.  Imbecile that I

was, I had not thought of that.  It was only a long swim that could be

fatal.



The sea was running high and the storm increasing.  It was growing late,

too--three or four in the afternoon.  Whether to venture toward the

mainland or not, was a question of some moment.  But we were so

distressed by thirst that we decide to try it, and so Higbie fell to work

and I took the steering-oar.  When we had pulled a mile, laboriously,

we were evidently in serious peril, for the storm had greatly augmented;

the billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests,

the heavens were hung with black, and the wind blew with great fury.

We would have gone back, now, but we did not dare to turn the boat

around, because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would

upset, of course.  Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the seas.

It was hard work to do this, she plunged so, and so beat and belabored

the billows with her rising and falling bows.  Now and then one of

Higbie's oars would trip on the top of a wave, and the other one would

snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus.

We were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat occasionally

shipped water.  By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his great

exertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should change

places with him till he could rest a little.  But I told him this was

impossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we

changed, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize,

and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soap-

suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present

at our own inquest.



But things cannot last always.  Just as the darkness shut down we came

booming into port, head on.  Higbie dropped his oars to hurrah--I dropped

mine to help--the sea gave the boat a twist, and over she went!



The agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises, chafes and blistered

hands, is unspeakable, and nothing but greasing all over will modify it--

but we ate, drank and slept well, that night, notwithstanding.



In speaking of the peculiarities of Mono Lake, I ought to have mentioned

that at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque turret-looking

masses and clusters of a whitish, coarse-grained rock that resembles

inferior mortar dried hard; and if one breaks off fragments of this rock

he will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly petrified gulls' eggs deeply

imbedded in the mass.  How did they get there?  I simply state the fact--

for it is a fact--and leave the geological reader to crack the nut at his

leisure and solve the problem after his own fashion.



At the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing excursion,

and spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak, and fished

successfully for trout in a bright, miniature lake whose surface was

between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea; cooling

ourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet

deep, under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers

flourished luxuriously; and at night entertaining ourselves by almost

freezing to death.  Then we returned to Mono Lake, and finding that the

cement excitement was over for the present, packed up and went back to

Esmeralda.  Mr. Ballou reconnoitred awhile, and not liking the prospect,

set out alone for Humboldt.



About this time occurred a little incident which has always had a sort of

interest to me, from the fact that it came so near "instigating" my

funeral.  At a time when an Indian attack had been expected, the citizens

hid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient to hand

when wanted.  A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the

bake-oven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open

ground near a frame out-house or shed, and from and after that day never

thought of it again.  We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for

us, and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub.  The ancient

stove reposed within six feet of him, and before his face.  Finally it

occurred to him that hot water would be better than cold, and he went out

and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a kettle of

water.  Then he returned to his tub.



I entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes, and was

about to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious crash, and

disappeared, leaving not a splinter behind.  Fragments of it fell in the

streets full two hundred yards away.  Nearly a third of the shed roof

over our heads was destroyed, and one of the stove lids, after cutting a

small stanchion half in two in front of the Indian, whizzed between us

and drove partly through the weather-boarding beyond.  I was as white as

a sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless.  But the Indian betrayed

no trepidation, no distress, not even discomfort.  He simply stopped

washing, leaned forward and surveyed the clean, blank ground a moment,

and then remarked:



"Mph!  Dam stove heap gone!"--and resumed his scrubbing as placidly as if

it were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do.  I will explain,

that "heap" is "Injun-English" for "very much."  The reader will perceive

the exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance.









CHAPTER XL.

I now come to a curious episode--the most curious, I think, that had yet

accented my slothful, valueless, heedless career.  Out of a hillside

toward the upper end of the town, projected a wall of reddish looking

quartz-croppings, the exposed comb of a silver-bearing ledge that

extended deep down into the earth, of course.  It was owned by a company

entitled the "Wide West."  There was a shaft sixty or seventy feet deep

on the under side of the croppings, and everybody was acquainted with the

rock that came from it--and tolerably rich rock it was, too, but nothing

extraordinary.  I will remark here, that although to the inexperienced

stranger all the quartz of a particular "district" looks about alike, an

old resident of the camp can take a glance at a mixed pile of rock,

separate the fragments and tell you which mine each came from, as easily

as a confectioner can separate and classify the various kinds and

qualities of candy in a mixed heap of the article.



All at once the town was thrown into a state of extraordinary excitement.

In mining parlance the Wide West had "struck it rich!"  Everybody went to

see the new developments, and for some days there was such a crowd of

people about the Wide West shaft that a stranger would have supposed

there was a mass meeting in session there.  No other topic was discussed

but the rich strike, and nobody thought or dreamed about anything else.

Every man brought away a specimen, ground it up in a hand mortar, washed

it out in his horn spoon, and glared speechless upon the marvelous

result.  It was not hard rock, but black, decomposed stuff which could be

crumbled in the hand like a baked potato, and when spread out on a paper

exhibited a thick sprinkling of gold and particles of "native" silver.

Higbie brought a handful to the cabin, and when he had washed it out his

amazement was beyond description.  Wide West stock soared skywards.  It

was said that repeated offers had been made for it at a thousand dollars

a foot, and promptly refused.  We have all had the "blues"--the mere sky-

blues--but mine were indigo, now--because I did not own in the Wide West.

The world seemed hollow to me, and existence a grief.  I lost my

appetite, and ceased to take an interest in anything.  Still I had to

stay, and listen to other people's rejoicings, because I had no money to

get out of the camp with.



The Wide West company put a stop to the carrying away of "specimens," and

well they might, for every handful of the ore was worth a sun of some

consequence.  To show the exceeding value of the ore, I will remark that

a sixteen-hundred-pounds parcel of it was sold, just as it lay, at the

mouth of the shaft, at one dollar a pound; and the man who bought it

"packed" it on mules a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles, over the

mountains, to San Francisco, satisfied that it would yield at a rate that

would richly compensate him for his trouble.  The Wide West people also

commanded their foreman to refuse any but their own operatives permission

to enter the mine at any time or for any purpose.  I kept up my "blue"

meditations and Higbie kept up a deal of thinking, too, but of a

different sort.  He puzzled over the "rock," examined it with a glass,

inspected it in different lights and from different points of view, and

after each experiment delivered himself, in soliloquy, of one and the

same unvarying opinion in the same unvarying formula:



"It is not Wide West rock!"



He said once or twice that he meant to have a look into the Wide West

shaft if he got shot for it.  I was wretched, and did not care whether he

got a look into it or not.  He failed that day, and tried again at night;

failed again; got up at dawn and tried, and failed again.  Then he lay in

ambush in the sage brush hour after hour, waiting for the two or three

hands to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner; made a start once,

but was premature--one of the men came back for something; tried it

again, but when almost at the mouth of the shaft, another of the men rose

up from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitre, and he dropped on the

ground and lay quiet; presently he crawled on his hands and knees to the

mouth of the shaft, gave a quick glance around, then seized the rope and

slid down the shaft.



He disappeared in the gloom of a "side drift" just as a head appeared in

the mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted "Hello!"--which he did not

answer.  He was not disturbed any more.  An hour later he entered the

cabin, hot, red, and ready to burst with smothered excitement, and

exclaimed in a stage whisper:



"I knew it!  We are rich!  IT'S A BLIND LEAD!"



I thought the very earth reeled under me.  Doubt--conviction--doubt

again--exultation--hope, amazement, belief, unbelief--every emotion

imaginable swept in wild procession through my heart and brain, and I

could not speak a word.  After a moment or two of this mental fury, I

shook myself to rights, and said:



"Say it again!"



"It's blind lead!"



"Cal, let's--let's burn the house--or kill somebody!  Let's get out where

there's room to hurrah!  But what is the use?  It is a hundred times too

good to be true."



"It's a blind lead, for a million!--hanging wall--foot wall--clay

casings--everything complete!" He swung his hat and gave three cheers,

and I cast doubt to the winds and chimed in with a will.  For I was worth

a million dollars, and did not care "whether school kept or not!"



But perhaps I ought to explain.  A "blind lead" is a lead or ledge that

does not "crop out" above the surface.  A miner does not know where to

look for such leads, but they are often stumbled upon by accident in the

course of driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft.  Higbie knew the Wide West

rock perfectly well, and the more he had examined the new developments

the more he was satisfied that the ore could not have come from the Wide

West vein.  And so had it occurred to him alone, of all the camp, that

there was a blind lead down in the shaft, and that even the Wide West

people themselves did not suspect it.  He was right.  When he went down

the shaft, he found that the blind lead held its independent way through

the Wide West vein, cutting it diagonally, and that it was enclosed in

its own well-defined casing-rocks and clay.  Hence it was public

property.  Both leads being perfectly well defined, it was easy for any

miner to see which one belonged to the Wide West and which did not.



We thought it well to have a strong friend, and therefore we brought the

foreman of the Wide West to our cabin that night and revealed the great

surprise to him.  Higbie said:



"We are going to take possession of this blind lead, record it and

establish ownership, and then forbid the Wide West company to take out

any more of the rock.  You cannot help your company in this matter--

nobody can help them.  I will go into the shaft with you and prove to

your entire satisfaction that it is a blind lead.  Now we propose to take

you in with us, and claim the blind lead in our three names.  What do you

say?"



What could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch forth his

hand and take possession of a fortune without risk of any kind and

without wronging any one or attaching the least taint of dishonor to his

name?  He could only say, "Agreed."



The notice was put up that night, and duly spread upon the recorder's

books before ten o'clock.  We claimed two hundred feet each--six hundred

feet in all--the smallest and compactest organization in the district,

and the easiest to manage.



No one can be so thoughtless as to suppose that we slept, that night.

Higbie and I went to bed at midnight, but it was only to lie broad awake

and think, dream, scheme.  The floorless, tumble-down cabin was a palace,

the ragged gray blankets silk, the furniture rosewood and mahogany.

Each new splendor that burst out of my visions of the future whirled me

bodily over in bed or jerked me to a sitting posture just as if an

electric battery had been applied to me.  We shot fragments of

conversation back and forth at each other.  Once Higbie said:



"When are you going home--to the States?"



"To-morrow!"--with an evolution or two, ending with a sitting position.

"Well--no--but next month, at furthest."



"We'll go in the same steamer."



"Agreed."



A pause.



"Steamer of the 10th?"



"Yes.  No, the 1st."



"All right."



Another pause.



"Where are you going to live?"  said Higbie.



"San Francisco."



"That's me!"



Pause.



"Too high--too much climbing"--from Higbie.



"What is?"



"I was thinking of Russian Hill--building a house up there."



"Too much climbing?  Shan't you keep a carriage?"



"Of course.  I forgot that."



Pause.



"Cal., what kind of a house are you going to build?"



"I was thinking about that.  Three-story and an attic."



"But what kind?"



"Well, I don't hardly know.  Brick, I suppose."



"Brick--bosh."



"Why?  What is your idea?"



"Brown stone front--French plate glass--billiard-room off the dining-

room--statuary and paintings--shrubbery and two-acre grass plat--

greenhouse--iron dog on the front stoop--gray horses--landau, and a

coachman with a bug on his hat!"



"By George!"



A long pause.



"Cal., when are you going to Europe?"



"Well--I hadn't thought of that.  When are you?"



"In the Spring."



"Going to be gone all summer?"



"All summer!  I shall remain there three years."



"No--but are you in earnest?"



"Indeed I am."



"I will go along too."



"Why of course you will."



"What part of Europe shall you go to?"



"All parts.  France, England, Germany--Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Syria,

Greece, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Egypt--all over--everywhere."



"I'm agreed."



"All right."



"Won't it be a swell trip!"



"We'll spend forty or fifty thousand dollars trying to make it one,

anyway."



Another long pause.



"Higbie, we owe the butcher six dollars, and he has been threatening to

stop our--"



"Hang the butcher!"



"Amen."



And so it went on.  By three o'clock we found it was no use, and so we

got up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise.  It was my week

to cook.  I always hated cooking--now, I abhorred it.



The news was all over town.  The former excitement was great--this one

was greater still.  I walked the streets serene and happy.  Higbie said

the foreman had been offered two hundred thousand dollars for his third

of the mine.  I said I would like to see myself selling for any such

price.  My ideas were lofty.  My figure was a million.  Still, I honestly

believe that if I had been offered it, it would have had no other effect

than to make me hold off for more.



I found abundant enjoyment in being rich.  A man offered me a three-

hundred-dollar horse, and wanted to take my simple, unendorsed note for

it.  That brought the most realizing sense I had yet had that I was

actually rich, beyond shadow of doubt.  It was followed by numerous other

evidences of a similar nature--among which I may mention the fact of the

butcher leaving us a double supply of meat and saying nothing about

money.



By the laws of the district, the "locators" or claimants of a ledge were

obliged to do a fair and reasonable amount of work on their new property

within ten days after the date of the location, or the property was

forfeited, and anybody could go and seize it that chose.  So we

determined to go to work the next day.  About the middle of the

afternoon, as I was coming out of the post office, I met a Mr. Gardiner,

who told me that Capt. John Nye was lying dangerously ill at his place

(the "Nine-Mile Ranch"), and that he and his wife were not able to give

him nearly as much care and attention as his case demanded.  I said if he

would wait for me a moment, I would go down and help in the sick room.

I ran to the cabin to tell Higbie.  He was not there, but I left a note

on the table for him, and a few minutes later I left town in Gardiner's

wagon.









CHAPTER XLI.



Captain Nye was very ill indeed, with spasmodic rheumatism.  But the old

gentleman was himself--which is to say, he was kind-hearted and agreeable

when comfortable, but a singularly violent wild-cat when things did not

go well.  He would be smiling along pleasantly enough, when a sudden

spasm of his disease would take him and he would go out of his smile into

a perfect fury.  He would groan and wail and howl with the anguish, and

fill up the odd chinks with the most elaborate profanity that strong

convictions and a fine fancy could contrive.  With fair opportunity he

could swear very well and handle his adjectives with considerable

judgment; but when the spasm was on him it was painful to listen to him,

he was so awkward.  However, I had seen him nurse a sick man himself and

put up patiently with the inconveniences of the situation, and

consequently I was willing that he should have full license now that his

own turn had come.  He could not disturb me, with all his raving and

ranting, for my mind had work on hand, and it labored on diligently,

night and day, whether my hands were idle or employed.  I was altering

and amending the plans for my house, and thinking over the propriety of

having the billard-room in the attic, instead of on the same floor with

the dining-room; also, I was trying to decide between green and blue for

the upholstery of the drawing-room, for, although my preference was blue

I feared it was a color that would be too easily damaged by dust and

sunlight; likewise while I was content to put the coachman in a modest

livery, I was uncertain about a footman--I needed one, and was even

resolved to have one, but wished he could properly appear and perform his

functions out of livery, for I somewhat dreaded so much show; and yet,

inasmuch as my late grandfather had had a coachman and such things, but

no liveries, I felt rather drawn to beat him;--or beat his ghost, at any

rate; I was also systematizing the European trip, and managed to get it

all laid out, as to route and length of time to be devoted to it--

everything, with one exception--namely, whether to cross the desert from

Cairo to Jerusalem per camel, or go by sea to Beirut, and thence down

through the country per caravan.  Meantime I was writing to the friends

at home every day, instructing them concerning all my plans and

intentions, and directing them to look up a handsome homestead for my

mother and agree upon a price for it against my coming, and also

directing them to sell my share of the Tennessee land and tender the

proceeds to the widows' and orphans' fund of the typographical union of

which I had long been a member in good standing.  [This Tennessee land

had been in the possession of the family many years, and promised to

confer high fortune upon us some day; it still promises it, but in a less

violent way.]



When I had been nursing the Captain nine days he was somewhat better,

but very feeble.  During the afternoon we lifted him into a chair and

gave him an alcoholic vapor bath, and then set about putting him on the

bed again.  We had to be exceedingly careful, for the least jar produced

pain.  Gardiner had his shoulders and I his legs; in an unfortunate

moment I stumbled and the patient fell heavily on the bed in an agony of

torture.  I never heard a man swear so in my life.  He raved like a

maniac, and tried to snatch a revolver from the table--but I got it.

He ordered me out of the house, and swore a world of oaths that he would

kill me wherever he caught me when he got on his feet again.  It was

simply a passing fury, and meant nothing.  I knew he would forget it in

an hour, and maybe be sorry for it, too; but it angered me a little, at

the moment.  So much so, indeed, that I determined to go back to

Esmeralda.  I thought he was able to get along alone, now, since he was

on the war path.  I took supper, and as soon as the moon rose, began my

nine-mile journey, on foot.



Even millionaires needed no horses, in those days, for a mere nine-mile

jaunt without baggage.



As I "raised the hill" overlooking the town, it lacked fifteen minutes of

twelve.  I glanced at the hill over beyond the canyon, and in the bright

moonlight saw what appeared to be about half the population of the

village massed on and around the Wide West croppings.  My heart gave an

exulting bound, and I said to myself, "They have made a new strike to-

night--and struck it richer than ever, no doubt."  I started over there,

but gave it up.  I said the "strick" would keep, and I had climbed hill

enough for one night.  I went on down through the town, and as I was

passing a little German bakery, a woman ran out and begged me to come in

and help her.  She said her husband had a fit.  I went in, and judged she

was right--he appeared to have a hundred of them, compressed into one.

Two Germans were there, trying to hold him, and not making much of a

success of it.  I ran up the street half a block or so and routed out a

sleeping doctor, brought him down half dressed, and we four wrestled with

the maniac, and doctored, drenched and bled him, for more than an hour,

and the poor German woman did the crying.  He grew quiet, now, and the

doctor and I withdrew and left him to his friends.



It was a little after one o'clock.  As I entered the cabin door, tired

but jolly, the dingy light of a tallow candle revealed Higbie, sitting by

the pine table gazing stupidly at my note, which he held in his fingers,

and looking pale, old, and haggard.  I halted, and looked at him.  He

looked at me, stolidly.  I said:



"Higbie, what--what is it?"



"We're ruined--we didn't do the work--THE BLIND LEAD'S RELOCATED!"



It was enough.  I sat down sick, grieved--broken-hearted, indeed.  A

minute before, I was rich and brimful of vanity; I was a pauper now, and

very meek.  We sat still an hour, busy with thought, busy with vain and

useless self-upbraidings, busy with "Why didn't I do this, and why didn't

I do that," but neither spoke a word.  Then we dropped into mutual

explanations, and the mystery was cleared away.  It came out that Higbie

had depended on me, as I had on him, and as both of us had on the

foreman.  The folly of it!  It was the first time that ever staid and

steadfast Higbie had left an important matter to chance or failed to be

true to his full share of a responsibility.



But he had never seen my note till this moment, and this moment was the

first time he had been in the cabin since the day he had seen me last.

He, also, had left a note for me, on that same fatal afternoon--had

ridden up on horseback, and looked through the window, and being in a

hurry and not seeing me, had tossed the note into the cabin through a

broken pane.  Here it was, on the floor, where it had remained

undisturbed for nine days:



      "Don't fail to do the work before the ten days expire.  W.

      has passed through and given me notice.  I am to join him at

      Mono Lake, and we shall go on from there to-night.  He says

      he will find it this time, sure.  CAL."



"W."  meant Whiteman, of course.  That thrice accursed "cement!"



That was the way of it.  An old miner, like Higbie, could no more

withstand the fascination of a mysterious mining excitement like this

"cement" foolishness, than he could refrain from eating when he was

famishing.  Higbie had been dreaming about the marvelous cement for

months; and now, against his better judgment, he had gone off and "taken

the chances" on my keeping secure a mine worth a million undiscovered

cement veins.  They had not been followed this time.  His riding out of

town in broad daylight was such a common-place thing to do that it had

not attracted any attention.  He said they prosecuted their search in the

fastnesses of the mountains during nine days, without success; they could

not find the cement.  Then a ghastly fear came over him that something

might have happened to prevent the doing of the necessary work to hold

the blind lead (though indeed he thought such a thing hardly possible),

and forthwith he started home with all speed.  He would have reached

Esmeralda in time, but his horse broke down and he had to walk a great

part of the distance.  And so it happened that as he came into Esmeralda

by one road, I entered it by another.  His was the superior energy,

however, for he went straight to the Wide West, instead of turning aside

as I had done--and he arrived there about five or ten minutes too late!

The "notice" was already up, the "relocation" of our mine completed

beyond recall, and the crowd rapidly dispersing.  He learned some facts

before he left the ground.  The foreman had not been seen about the

streets since the night we had located the mine--a telegram had called

him to California on a matter of life and death, it was said.  At any

rate he had done no work and the watchful eyes of the community were

taking note of the fact.  At midnight of this woful tenth day, the ledge

would be "relocatable," and by eleven o'clock the hill was black with men

prepared to do the relocating.  That was the crowd I had seen when I

fancied a new "strike" had been made--idiot that I was.



[We three had the same right to relocate the lead that other people had,

provided we were quick enough.] As midnight was announced, fourteen men,

duly armed and ready to back their proceedings, put up their "notice" and

proclaimed their ownership of the blind lead, under the new name of the

"Johnson."  But A. D. Allen our partner (the foreman) put in a sudden

appearance about that time, with a cocked revolver in his hand, and said

his name must be added to the list, or he would "thin out the Johnson

company some."  He was a manly, splendid, determined fellow, and known to

be as good as his word, and therefore a compromise was effected.  They

put in his name for a hundred feet, reserving to themselves the customary

two hundred feet each.  Such was the history of the night's events, as

Higbie gathered from a friend on the way home.



Higbie and I cleared out on a new mining excitement the next morning,

glad to get away from the scene of our sufferings, and after a month or

two of hardship and disappointment, returned to Esmeralda once more.

Then we learned that the Wide West and the Johnson companies had

consolidated; that the stock, thus united, comprised five thousand feet,

or shares; that the foreman, apprehending tiresome litigation, and

considering such a huge concern unwieldy, had sold his hundred feet for

ninety thousand dollars in gold and gone home to the States to enjoy it.

If the stock was worth such a gallant figure, with five thousand shares

in the corporation, it makes me dizzy to think what it would have been

worth with only our original six hundred in it.  It was the difference

between six hundred men owning a house and five thousand owning it.  We

would have been millionaires if we had only worked with pick and spade

one little day on our property and so secured our ownership!



It reads like a wild fancy sketch, but the evidence of many witnesses,

and likewise that of the official records of Esmeralda District, is

easily obtainable in proof that it is a true history.  I can always have

it to say that I was absolutely and unquestionably worth a million

dollars, once, for ten days.



A year ago my esteemed and in every way estimable old millionaire

partner, Higbie, wrote me from an obscure little mining camp in

California that after nine or ten years of buffetings and hard striving,

he was at last in a position where he could command twenty-five hundred

dollars, and said he meant to go into the fruit business in a modest way.

How such a thought would have insulted him the night we lay in our cabin

planning European trips and brown stone houses on Russian Hill!









CHAPTER XLII.



What to do next?



It was a momentous question.  I had gone out into the world to shift for

myself, at the age of thirteen (for my father had endorsed for friends;

and although he left us a sumptuous legacy of pride in his fine Virginian

stock and its national distinction, I presently found that I could not

live on that alone without occasional bread to wash it down with).  I had

gained a livelihood in various vocations, but had not dazzled anybody

with my successes; still the list was before me, and the amplest liberty

in the matter of choosing, provided I wanted to work--which I did not,

after being so wealthy.  I had once been a grocery clerk, for one day,

but had consumed so much sugar in that time that I was relieved from

further duty by the proprietor; said he wanted me outside, so that he

could have my custom.  I had studied law an entire week, and then given

it up because it was so prosy and tiresome.  I had engaged briefly in the

study of blacksmithing, but wasted so much time trying to fix the bellows

so that it would blow itself, that the master turned me adrift in

disgrace, and told me I would come to no good.  I had been a bookseller's

clerk for awhile, but the customers bothered me so much I could not read

with any comfort, and so the proprietor gave me a furlough and forgot to

put a limit to it.  I had clerked in a drug store part of a summer, but

my prescriptions were unlucky, and we appeared to sell more stomach pumps

than soda water.  So I had to go.  I had made of myself a tolerable

printer, under the impression that I would be another Franklin some day,

but somehow had missed the connection thus far.  There was no berth open

in the Esmeralda Union, and besides I had always been such a slow

compositor that I looked with envy upon the achievements of apprentices

of two years' standing; and when I took a "take," foremen were in the

habit of suggesting that it would be wanted "some time during the year."



I was a good average St. Louis and New Orleans pilot and by no means

ashamed of my abilities in that line; wages were two hundred and fifty

dollars a month and no board to pay, and I did long to stand behind a

wheel again and never roam any more--but I had been making such an ass of

myself lately in grandiloquent letters home about my blind lead and my

European excursion that I did what many and many a poor disappointed

miner had done before; said "It is all over with me now, and I will never

go back home to be pitied--and snubbed."  I had been a private secretary,

a silver miner and a silver mill operative, and amounted to less than

nothing in each, and now--



What to do next?



I yielded to Higbie's appeals and consented to try the mining once more.

We climbed far up on the mountain side and went to work on a little

rubbishy claim of ours that had a shaft on it eight feet deep.  Higbie

descended into it and worked bravely with his pick till he had loosened

up a deal of rock and dirt and then I went down with a long-handled

shovel (the most awkward invention yet contrived by man) to throw it out.

You must brace the shovel forward with the side of your knee till it is

full, and then, with a skilful toss, throw it backward over your left

shoulder.  I made the toss, and landed the mess just on the edge of the

shaft and it all came back on my head and down the back of my neck.

I never said a word, but climbed out and walked home.  I inwardly

resolved that I would starve before I would make a target of myself and

shoot rubbish at it with a long-handled shovel.



I sat down, in the cabin, and gave myself up to solid misery--so to

speak.  Now in pleasanter days I had amused myself with writing letters

to the chief paper of the Territory, the Virginia Daily Territorial

Enterprise, and had always been surprised when they appeared in print.

My good opinion of the editors had steadily declined; for it seemed to me

that they might have found something better to fill up with than my

literature.  I had found a letter in the post office as I came home from

the hill side, and finally I opened it.  Eureka!  [I never did know what

Eureka meant, but it seems to be as proper a word to heave in as any when

no other that sounds pretty offers.] It was a deliberate offer to me of

Twenty-Five Dollars a week to come up to Virginia and be city editor of

the Enterprise.



I would have challenged the publisher in the "blind lead" days--I wanted

to fall down and worship him, now.  Twenty-Five Dollars a week--it looked

like bloated luxury--a fortune a sinful and lavish waste of money.

But my transports cooled when I thought of my inexperience and consequent

unfitness for the position--and straightway, on top of this, my long

array of failures rose up before me.  Yet if I refused this place I must

presently become dependent upon somebody for my bread, a thing

necessarily distasteful to a man who had never experienced such a

humiliation since he was thirteen years old.  Not much to be proud of,

since it is so common--but then it was all I had to be proud of.  So I

was scared into being a city editor.  I would have declined, otherwise.

Necessity is the mother of "taking chances."  I do not doubt that if, at

that time, I had been offered a salary to translate the Talmud from the

original Hebrew, I would have accepted--albeit with diffidence and some

misgivings--and thrown as much variety into it as I could for the money.



I went up to Virginia and entered upon my new vocation.  I was a rusty

looking city editor, I am free to confess--coatless, slouch hat, blue

woolen shirt, pantaloons stuffed into boot-tops, whiskered half down to

the waist, and the universal navy revolver slung to my belt.  But I

secured a more Christian costume and discarded the revolver.



I had never had occasion to kill anybody, nor ever felt a desire to do

so, but had worn the thing in deference to popular sentiment, and in

order that I might not, by its absence, be offensively conspicuous, and a

subject of remark.  But the other editors, and all the printers, carried

revolvers.  I asked the chief editor and proprietor (Mr. Goodman, I will

call him, since it describes him as well as any name could do) for some

instructions with regard to my duties, and he told me to go all over town

and ask all sorts of people all sorts of questions, make notes of the

information gained, and write them out for publication.  And he added:



"Never say 'We learn' so-and-so, or 'It is reported,' or 'It is rumored,'

or 'We understand' so-and-so, but go to headquarters and get the absolute

facts, and then speak out and say 'It is so-and-so.'  Otherwise, people

will not put confidence in your news.  Unassailable certainly is the

thing that gives a newspaper the firmest and most valuable reputation."



It was the whole thing in a nut-shell; and to this day when I find a

reporter commencing his article with "We understand," I gather a

suspicion that he has not taken as much pains to inform himself as he

ought to have done.  I moralize well, but I did not always practise well

when I was a city editor; I let fancy get the upper hand of fact too

often when there was a dearth of news.  I can never forget my first day's

experience as a reporter.  I wandered about town questioning everybody,

boring everybody, and finding out that nobody knew anything.  At the end

of five hours my notebook was still barren.  I spoke to Mr. Goodman.  He

said:



"Dan used to make a good thing out of the hay wagons in a dry time when

there were no fires or inquests.  Are there no hay wagons in from the

Truckee?  If there are, you might speak of the renewed activity and all

that sort of thing, in the hay business, you know.



"It isn't sensational or exciting, but it fills up and looks business

like."



I canvassed the city again and found one wretched old hay truck dragging

in from the country.  But I made affluent use of it.  I multiplied it by

sixteen, brought it into town from sixteen different directions, made

sixteen separate items out of it, and got up such another sweat about hay

as Virginia City had never seen in the world before.



This was encouraging.  Two nonpareil columns had to be filled, and I was

getting along.  Presently, when things began to look dismal again, a

desperado killed a man in a saloon and joy returned once more.  I never

was so glad over any mere trifle before in my life.  I said to the

murderer:



"Sir, you are a stranger to me, but you have done me a kindness this day

which I can never forget.  If whole years of gratitude can be to you any

slight compensation, they shall be yours.  I was in trouble and you have

relieved me nobly and at a time when all seemed dark and drear.  Count me

your friend from this time forth, for I am not a man to forget a favor."



If I did not really say that to him I at least felt a sort of itching

desire to do it.  I wrote up the murder with a hungry attention to

details, and when it was finished experienced but one regret--namely,

that they had not hanged my benefactor on the spot, so that I could work

him up too.



Next I discovered some emigrant wagons going into camp on the plaza and

found that they had lately come through the hostile Indian country and

had fared rather roughly.  I made the best of the item that the

circumstances permitted, and felt that if I were not confined within

rigid limits by the presence of the reporters of the other papers I could

add particulars that would make the article much more interesting.

However, I found one wagon that was going on to California, and made some

judicious inquiries of the proprietor.  When I learned, through his short

and surly answers to my cross-questioning, that he was certainly going on

and would not be in the city next day to make trouble, I got ahead of the

other papers, for I took down his list of names and added his party to

the killed and wounded.  Having more scope here, I put this wagon through

an Indian fight that to this day has no parallel in history.



My two columns were filled.  When I read them over in the morning I felt

that I had found my legitimate occupation at last.  I reasoned within

myself that news, and stirring news, too, was what a paper needed, and I

felt that I was peculiarly endowed with the ability to furnish it.

Mr. Goodman said that I was as good a reporter as Dan.  I desired no

higher commendation.  With encouragement like that, I felt that I could

take my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and

the interests of the paper demanded it.









CHAPTER XLIII.



However, as I grew better acquainted with the business and learned the

run of the sources of information I ceased to require the aid of fancy to

any large extent, and became able to fill my columns without diverging

noticeably from the domain of fact.



I struck up friendships with the reporters of the other journals, and we

swapped "regulars" with each other and thus economized work.  "Regulars"

are permanent sources of news, like courts, bullion returns, "clean-ups"

at the quartz mills, and inquests.  Inasmuch as everybody went armed, we

had an inquest about every day, and so this department was naturally set

down among the "regulars."  We had lively papers in those days.  My great

competitor among the reporters was Boggs of the Union.  He was an

excellent reporter.  Once in three or four months he would get a little

intoxicated, but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker

although always ready to tamper a little with the enemy.  He had the

advantage of me in one thing; he could get the monthly public school

report and I could not, because the principal hated the Enterprise.

One snowy night when the report was due, I started out sadly wondering

how I was going to get it.  Presently, a few steps up the almost deserted

street I stumbled on Boggs and asked him where he was going.



"After the school report."



"I'll go along with you."



"No, sir.  I'll excuse you."



"Just as you say."



A saloon-keeper's boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch, and

Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully.  He gazed fondly after the boy

and saw him start up the Enterprise stairs.  I said:



"I wish you could help me get that school business, but since you can't,

I must run up to the Union office and see if I can get them to let me

have a proof of it after they have set it up, though I don't begin to

suppose they will.  Good night."



"Hold on a minute.  I don't mind getting the report and sitting around

with the boys a little, while you copy it, if you're willing to drop down

to the principal's with me."



"Now you talk like a rational being.  Come along."



We plowed a couple of blocks through the snow, got the report and

returned to our office.  It was a short document and soon copied.

Meantime Boggs helped himself to the punch.  I gave the manuscript back

to him and we started out to get an inquest, for we heard pistol shots

near by.  We got the particulars with little loss of time, for it was

only an inferior sort of bar-room murder, and of little interest to the

public, and then we separated.  Away at three o'clock in the morning,

when we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as usual--

for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on

the guitar and on that atrocity the accordion--the proprietor of the

Union strode in and desired to know if anybody had heard anything of

Boggs or the school report.  We stated the case, and all turned out to

help hunt for the delinquent.  We found him standing on a table in a

saloon, with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the

other, haranguing a gang of intoxicated Cornish miners on the iniquity of

squandering the public moneys on education "when hundreds and hundreds of

honest hard-working men are literally starving for whiskey."  [Riotous

applause.]  He had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for

hours.  We dragged him away and put him to bed.



Of course there was no school report in the Union, and Boggs held me

accountable, though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass

its absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the

misfortune had occurred.



But we were perfectly friendly.  The day that the school report was next

due, the proprietor of the "Genessee" mine furnished us a buggy and asked

us to go down and write something about the property--a very common

request and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies,

for we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people.  In due time

we arrived at the "mine"--nothing but a hole in the ground ninety feet

deep, and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and

being lowered with a windlass.  The workmen had just gone off somewhere

to dinner.  I was not strong enough to lower Boggs's bulk; so I took an

unlighted candle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the

rope, implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start

of him, and then swung out over the shaft.  I reached the bottom muddy

and bruised about the elbows, but safe.  I lit the candle, made an

examination of the rock, selected some specimens and shouted to Boggs to

hoist away.  No answer.  Presently a head appeared in the circle of

daylight away aloft, and a voice came down:



"Are you all set?"



"All set--hoist away."



"Are you comfortable?"



"Perfectly."



"Could you wait a little?"



"Oh certainly--no particular hurry."



"Well--good by."



"Why?  Where are you going?"



"After the school report!"



And he did.  I staid down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when

they hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock.

I walked home, too--five miles--up hill.  We had no school report next

morning; but the Union had.



Six months after my entry into journalism the grand "flush times" of

Silverland began, and they continued with unabated splendor for three

years.  All difficulty about filling up the "local department" ceased,

and the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the

world of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every

day.  Virginia had grown to be the "livest" town, for its age and

population, that America had ever produced.  The sidewalks swarmed with

people--to such an extent, indeed, that it was generally no easy matter

to stem the human tide.  The streets themselves were just as crowded with

quartz wagons, freight teams and other vehicles.  The procession was

endless.  So great was the pack, that buggies frequently had to wait half

an hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street.  Joy sat on

every countenance, and there was a glad, almost fierce, intensity in

every eye, that told of the money-getting schemes that were seething in

every brain and the high hope that held sway in every heart.  Money was

as plenty as dust; every individual considered himself wealthy, and a

melancholy countenance was nowhere to be seen.  There were military

companies, fire companies, brass bands, banks, hotels, theatres, "hurdy-

gurdy houses," wide-open gambling palaces, political pow-wows, civic

processions, street fights, murders, inquests, riots, a whiskey mill

every fifteen steps, a Board of Aldermen, a Mayor, a City Surveyor, a

City Engineer, a Chief of the Fire Department, with First, Second and

Third Assistants, a Chief of Police, City Marshal and a large police

force, two Boards of Mining Brokers, a dozen breweries and half a dozen

jails and station-houses in full operation, and some talk of building a

church.  The "flush times" were in magnificent flower!  Large fire-proof

brick buildings were going up in the principal streets, and the wooden

suburbs were spreading out in all directions.  Town lots soared up to

prices that were amazing.



The great "Comstock lode" stretched its opulent length straight through

the town from north to south, and every mine on it was in diligent

process of development.  One of these mines alone employed six hundred

and seventy-five men, and in the matter of elections the adage was, "as

the 'Gould and Curry' goes, so goes the city."  Laboring men's wages were

four and six dollars a day, and they worked in three "shifts" or gangs,

and the blasting and picking and shoveling went on without ceasing, night

and day.



The "city" of Virginia roosted royally midway up the steep side of Mount

Davidson, seven thousand two hundred feet above the level of the sea, and

in the clear Nevada atmosphere was visible from a distance of fifty

miles!  It claimed a population of fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand,

and all day long half of this little army swarmed the streets like bees

and the other half swarmed among the drifts and tunnels of the

"Comstock," hundreds of feet down in the earth directly under those same

streets.  Often we felt our chairs jar, and heard the faint boom of a

blast down in the bowels of the earth under the office.



The mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it

like a roof.  Each street was a terrace, and from each to the next street

below the descent was forty or fifty feet.  The fronts of the houses were

level with the street they faced, but their rear first floors were

propped on lofty stilts; a man could stand at a rear first floor window

of a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below

him facing D street.  It was a laborious climb, in that thin atmosphere,

to ascend from D to A street, and you were panting and out of breath when

you got there; but you could turn around and go down again like a house

a-fire--so to speak.  The atmosphere was so rarified, on account of the

great altitude, that one's blood lay near the surface always, and the

scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about, for the chances

were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue.  But to offset this, the

thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds, and therefore,

to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely

to afford you any permanent satisfaction, for he would be nearly certain

to be around looking for you within the month, and not with an opera

glass, either.



From Virginia's airy situation one could look over a vast, far-reaching

panorama of mountain ranges and deserts; and whether the day was bright

or overcast, whether the sun was rising or setting, or flaming in the

zenith, or whether night and the moon held sway, the spectacle was always

impressive and beautiful.  Over your head Mount Davidson lifted its gray

dome, and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the battlemented

hills, making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted desert was

glimpsed, with the silver thread of a river winding through it, bordered

with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a delicate fringe;

and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and stretched their

long barrier to the filmy horizon--far enough beyond a lake that burned

in the desert like a fallen sun, though that, itself, lay fifty miles

removed.  Look from your window where you would, there was fascination in

the picture.  At rare intervals--but very rare--there were clouds in our

skies, and then the setting sun would gild and flush and glorify this

mighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of color that held the

eye like a spell and moved the spirit like music.









CHAPTER XLIV.



My salary was increased to forty dollars a week.  But I seldom drew it.

I had plenty of other resources, and what were two broad twenty-dollar

gold pieces to a man who had his pockets full of such and a cumbersome

abundance of bright half dollars besides?  [Paper money has never come

into use on the Pacific coast.]  Reporting was lucrative, and every man

in the town was lavish with his money and his "feet."  The city and all

the great mountain side were riddled with mining shafts.  There were more

mines than miners.  True, not ten of these mines were yielding rock worth

hauling to a mill, but everybody said, "Wait till the shaft gets down

where the ledge comes in solid, and then you will see!"  So nobody was

discouraged.  These were nearly all "wild cat" mines, and wholly

worthless, but nobody believed it then.  The "Ophir," the "Gould &

Curry," the "Mexican," and other great mines on the Comstock lead in

Virginia and Gold Hill were turning out huge piles of rich rock every

day, and every man believed that his little wild cat claim was as good as

any on the "main lead" and would infallibly be worth a thousand dollars a

foot when he "got down where it came in solid."  Poor fellow, he was

blessedly blind to the fact that he never would see that day.  So the

thousand wild cat shafts burrowed deeper and deeper into the earth day by

day, and all men were beside themselves with hope and happiness.  How

they labored, prophesied, exulted!  Surely nothing like it was ever seen

before since the world began.  Every one of these wild cat mines--not

mines, but holes in the ground over imaginary mines--was incorporated and

had handsomely engraved "stock" and the stock was salable, too.  It was

bought and sold with a feverish avidity in the boards every day.  You

could go up on the mountain side, scratch around and find a ledge (there

was no lack of them), put up a "notice" with a grandiloquent name in it,

start a shaft, get your stock printed, and with nothing whatever to prove

that your mine was worth a straw, you could put your stock on the market

and sell out for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  To make money,

and make it fast, was as easy as it was to eat your dinner.



Every man owned "feet" in fifty different wild cat mines and considered

his fortune made.  Think of a city with not one solitary poor man in it!

One would suppose that when month after month went by and still not a

wild cat mine (by wild cat I mean, in general terms, any claim not

located on the mother vein, i.e., the "Comstock") yielded a ton of rock

worth crushing, the people would begin to wonder if they were not putting

too much faith in their prospective riches; but there was not a thought

of such a thing.  They burrowed away, bought and sold, and were happy.



New claims were taken up daily, and it was the friendly custom to run

straight to the newspaper offices, give the reporter forty or fifty

"feet," and get them to go and examine the mine and publish a notice of

it.  They did not care a fig what you said about the property so you said

something.  Consequently we generally said a word or two to the effect

that the "indications" were good, or that the ledge was "six feet wide,"

or that the rock "resembled the Comstock" (and so it did--but as a

general thing the resemblance was not startling enough to knock you

down).  If the rock was moderately promising, we followed the custom of

the country, used strong adjectives and frothed at the mouth as if a very

marvel in silver discoveries had transpired.  If the mine was a

"developed" one, and had no pay ore to show (and of course it hadn't), we

praised the tunnel; said it was one of the most infatuating tunnels in

the land; driveled and driveled about the tunnel till we ran entirely out

of ecstasies--but never said a word about the rock.  We would squander

half a column of adulation on a shaft, or a new wire rope, or a dressed

pine windlass, or a fascinating force pump, and close with a burst of

admiration of the "gentlemanly and efficient Superintendent" of the mine

--but never utter a whisper about the rock.  And those people were always

pleased, always satisfied.  Occasionally we patched up and varnished our

reputation for discrimination and stern, undeviating accuracy, by giving

some old abandoned claim a blast that ought to have made its dry bones

rattle--and then somebody would seize it and sell it on the fleeting

notoriety thus conferred upon it.



There was nothing in the shape of a mining claim that was not salable.

We received presents of "feet" every day.  If we needed a hundred dollars

or so, we sold some; if not, we hoarded it away, satisfied that it would

ultimately be worth a thousand dollars a foot.  I had a trunk about half

full of "stock."  When a claim made a stir in the market and went up to a

high figure, I searched through my pile to see if I had any of its stock

--and generally found it.



The prices rose and fell constantly; but still a fall disturbed us

little, because a thousand dollars a foot was our figure, and so we were

content to let it fluctuate as much as it pleased till it reached it.

My pile of stock was not all given to me by people who wished their

claims "noticed."  At least half of it was given me by persons who had no

thought of such a thing, and looked for nothing more than a simple verbal

"thank you;" and you were not even obliged by law to furnish that.

If you are coming up the street with a couple of baskets of apples in

your hands, and you meet a friend, you naturally invite him to take a

few.  That describes the condition of things in Virginia in the "flush

times."  Every man had his pockets full of stock, and it was the actual

custom of the country to part with small quantities of it to friends

without the asking.



Very often it was a good idea to close the transaction instantly, when a

man offered a stock present to a friend, for the offer was only good and

binding at that moment, and if the price went to a high figure shortly

afterward the procrastination was a thing to be regretted.  Mr. Stewart

(Senator, now, from Nevada) one day told me he would give me twenty feet

of "Justis" stock if I would walk over to his office.  It was worth five

or ten dollars a foot.  I asked him to make the offer good for next day,

as I was just going to dinner.  He said he would not be in town; so I

risked it and took my dinner instead of the stock.  Within the week the

price went up to seventy dollars and afterward to a hundred and fifty,

but nothing could make that man yield.  I suppose he sold that stock of

mine and placed the guilty proceeds in his own pocket.  [My revenge will

be found in the accompanying portrait.]  I met three friends one

afternoon, who said they had been buying "Overman" stock at auction at

eight dollars a foot.  One said if I would come up to his office he would

give me fifteen feet; another said he would add fifteen; the third said

he would do the same.  But I was going after an inquest and could not

stop.  A few weeks afterward they sold all their "Overman" at six hundred

dollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about it--and also

to urge me to accept of the next forty-five feet of it that people tried

to force on me.



These are actual facts, and I could make the list a long one and still

confine myself strictly to the truth.  Many a time friends gave us as

much as twenty-five feet of stock that was selling at twenty-five dollars

a foot, and they thought no more of it than they would of offering a

guest a cigar.  These were "flush times" indeed!  I thought they were

going to last always, but somehow I never was much of a prophet.



To show what a wild spirit possessed the mining brain of the community,

I will remark that "claims" were actually "located" in excavations for

cellars, where the pick had exposed what seemed to be quartz veins--and

not cellars in the suburbs, either, but in the very heart of the city;

and forthwith stock would be issued and thrown on the market.  It was

small matter who the cellar belonged to--the "ledge" belonged to the

finder, and unless the United States government interfered (inasmuch as

the government holds the primary right to mines of the noble metals in

Nevada--or at least did then), it was considered to be his privilege to

work it.  Imagine a stranger staking out a mining claim among the costly

shrubbery in your front yard and calmly proceeding to lay waste the

ground with pick and shovel and blasting powder!  It has been often done

in California.  In the middle of one of the principal business streets of

Virginia, a man "located" a mining claim and began a shaft on it.  He

gave me a hundred feet of the stock and I sold it for a fine suit of

clothes because I was afraid somebody would fall down the shaft and sue

for damages.  I owned in another claim that was located in the middle of

another street; and to show how absurd people can be, that "East India"

stock (as it was called) sold briskly although there was an ancient

tunnel running directly under the claim and any man could go into it and

see that it did not cut a quartz ledge or anything that remotely

resembled one.



One plan of acquiring sudden wealth was to "salt" a wild cat claim and

sell out while the excitement was up.  The process was simple.



The schemer located a worthless ledge, sunk a shaft on it, bought a wagon

load of rich "Comstock" ore, dumped a portion of it into the shaft and

piled the rest by its side, above ground.  Then he showed the property to

a simpleton and sold it to him at a high figure.  Of course the wagon

load of rich ore was all that the victim ever got out of his purchase.

A most remarkable case of "salting" was that of the "North Ophir."

It was claimed that this vein was a "remote extension" of the original

"Ophir," a valuable mine on the "Comstock."  For a few days everybody was

talking about the rich developments in the North Ophir.  It was said that

it yielded perfectly pure silver in small, solid lumps.  I went to the

place with the owners, and found a shaft six or eight feet deep, in the

bottom of which was a badly shattered vein of dull, yellowish,

unpromising rock.  One would as soon expect to find silver in a

grindstone.  We got out a pan of the rubbish and washed it in a puddle,

and sure enough, among the sediment we found half a dozen black, bullet-

looking pellets of unimpeachable "native" silver.  Nobody had ever heard

of such a thing before; science could not account for such a queer

novelty.  The stock rose to sixty-five dollars a foot, and at this figure

the world-renowned tragedian, McKean Buchanan, bought a commanding

interest and prepared to quit the stage once more--he was always doing

that.  And then it transpired that the mine had been "salted"--and not in

any hackneyed way, either, but in a singularly bold, barefaced and

peculiarly original and outrageous fashion.  On one of the lumps of

"native" silver was discovered the minted legend, "TED STATES OF," and

then it was plainly apparent that the mine had been "salted" with melted

half-dollars!  The lumps thus obtained had been blackened till they

resembled native silver, and were then mixed with the shattered rock in

the bottom of the shaft.  It is literally true.  Of course the price of

the stock at once fell to nothing, and the tragedian was ruined.  But for

this calamity we might have lost McKean Buchanan from the stage.









CHAPTER XLV.



The "flush times" held bravely on.  Something over two years before, Mr.

Goodman and another journeyman printer, had borrowed forty dollars and

set out from San Francisco to try their fortunes in the new city of

Virginia.  They found the Territorial Enterprise, a poverty-stricken

weekly journal, gasping for breath and likely to die.  They bought it,

type, fixtures, good-will and all, for a thousand dollars, on long time.

The editorial sanctum, news-room, press-room, publication office, bed-

chamber, parlor, and kitchen were all compressed into one apartment and

it was a small one, too.  The editors and printers slept on the floor, a

Chinaman did their cooking, and the "imposing-stone" was the general

dinner table.  But now things were changed.  The paper was a great daily,

printed by steam; there were five editors and twenty-three compositors;

the subscription price was sixteen dollars a year; the advertising rates

were exorbitant, and the columns crowded.  The paper was clearing from

six to ten thousand dollars a month, and the "Enterprise Building" was

finished and ready for occupation--a stately fireproof brick.  Every day

from five all the way up to eleven columns of "live" advertisements were

left out or crowded into spasmodic and irregular "supplements."



The "Gould & Curry" company were erecting a monster hundred-stamp mill at

a cost that ultimately fell little short of a million dollars.  Gould &

Curry stock paid heavy dividends--a rare thing, and an experience

confined to the dozen or fifteen claims located on the "main lead," the

"Comstock."  The Superintendent of the Gould & Curry lived, rent free, in

a fine house built and furnished by the company.  He drove a fine pair of

horses which were a present from the company, and his salary was twelve

thousand dollars a year.  The superintendent of another of the great

mines traveled in grand state, had a salary of twenty-eight thousand

dollars a year, and in a law suit in after days claimed that he was to

have had one per cent. on the gross yield of the bullion likewise.



Money was wonderfully plenty.  The trouble was, not how to get it,--but

how to spend it, how to lavish it, get rid of it, squander it.  And so it

was a happy thing that just at this juncture the news came over the wires

that a great United States Sanitary Commission had been formed and money

was wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of the

Union languishing in the Eastern hospitals.  Right on the heels of it

came word that San Francisco had responded superbly before the telegram

was half a day old.  Virginia rose as one man!  A Sanitary Committee was

hurriedly organized, and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in C street

and tried to make the clamorous multitude understand that the rest of the

committee were flying hither and thither and working with all their might

and main, and that if the town would only wait an hour, an office would

be ready, books opened, and the Commission prepared to receive

contributions.  His voice was drowned and his information lost in a

ceaseless roar of cheers, and demands that the money be received now--

they swore they would not wait.  The chairman pleaded and argued, but,

deaf to all entreaty, men plowed their way through the throng and rained

checks of gold coin into the cart and skurried away for more.  Hands

clutching money, were thrust aloft out of the jam by men who hoped this

eloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could not open.

The very Chinamen and Indians caught the excitement and dashed their half

dollars into the cart without knowing or caring what it was all about.

Women plunged into the crowd, trimly attired, fought their way to the

cart with their coin, and emerged again, by and by, with their apparel in

a state of hopeless dilapidation.  It was the wildest mob Virginia had

ever seen and the most determined and ungovernable; and when at last it

abated its fury and dispersed, it had not a penny in its pocket.



To use its own phraseology, it came there "flush" and went away "busted."



After that, the Commission got itself into systematic working order, and

for weeks the contributions flowed into its treasury in a generous

stream.  Individuals and all sorts of organizations levied upon

themselves a regular weekly tax for the sanitary fund, graduated

according to their means, and there was not another grand universal

outburst till the famous "Sanitary Flour Sack" came our way.  Its history

is peculiar and interesting.  A former schoolmate of mine, by the name of

Reuel Gridley, was living at the little city of Austin, in the Reese

river country, at this time, and was the Democratic candidate for mayor.

He and the Republican candidate made an agreement that the defeated man

should be publicly presented with a fifty-pound sack of flour by the

successful one, and should carry it home on his shoulder.  Gridley was

defeated.  The new mayor gave him the sack of flour, and he shouldered it

and carried it a mile or two, from Lower Austin to his home in Upper

Austin, attended by a band of music and the whole population.  Arrived

there, he said he did not need the flour, and asked what the people

thought he had better do with it.  A voice said:



"Sell it to the highest bidder, for the benefit of the Sanitary fund."



The suggestion was greeted with a round of applause, and Gridley mounted

a dry-goods box and assumed the role of auctioneer.  The bids went higher

and higher, as the sympathies of the pioneers awoke and expanded, till at

last the sack was knocked down to a mill man at two hundred and fifty

dollars, and his check taken.  He was asked where he would have the flour

delivered, and he said:



"Nowhere--sell it again."



Now the cheers went up royally, and the multitude were fairly in the

spirit of the thing.  So Gridley stood there and shouted and perspired

till the sun went down; and when the crowd dispersed he had sold the sack

to three hundred different people, and had taken in eight thousand

dollars in gold.  And still the flour sack was in his possession.



The news came to Virginia, and a telegram went back:



"Fetch along your flour sack!"



Thirty-six hours afterward Gridley arrived, and an afternoon mass meeting

was held in the Opera House, and the auction began.  But the sack had

come sooner than it was expected; the people were not thoroughly aroused,

and the sale dragged.  At nightfall only five thousand dollars had been

secured, and there was a crestfallen feeling in the community.  However,

there was no disposition to let the matter rest here and acknowledge

vanquishment at the hands of the village of Austin.  Till late in the

night the principal citizens were at work arranging the morrow's

campaign, and when they went to bed they had no fears for the result.

At eleven the next morning a procession of open carriages, attended by

clamorous bands of music and adorned with a moving display of flags,

filed along C street and was soon in danger of blockade by a huzzaing

multitude of citizens.  In the first carriage sat Gridley, with the flour

sack in prominent view, the latter splendid with bright paint and gilt

lettering; also in the same carriage sat the mayor and the recorder.

The other carriages contained the Common Council, the editors and

reporters, and other people of imposing consequence.  The crowd pressed

to the corner of C and Taylor streets, expecting the sale to begin there,

but they were disappointed, and also unspeakably surprised; for the

cavalcade moved on as if Virginia had ceased to be of importance, and

took its way over the "divide," toward the small town of Gold Hill.

Telegrams had gone ahead to Gold Hill, Silver City and Dayton, and those

communities were at fever heat and rife for the conflict.  It was a very

hot day, and wonderfully dusty.  At the end of a short half hour we

descended into Gold Hill with drums beating and colors flying, and

enveloped in imposing clouds of dust.  The whole population--men, women

and children, Chinamen and Indians, were massed in the main street, all

the flags in town were at the mast head, and the blare of the bands was

drowned in cheers.  Gridley stood up and asked who would make the first

bid for the National Sanitary Flour Sack.  Gen. W. said:



"The Yellow Jacket silver mining company offers a thousand dollars,

coin!"



A tempest of applause followed.  A telegram carried the news to Virginia,

and fifteen minutes afterward that city's population was massed in the

streets devouring the tidings--for it was part of the programme that the

bulletin boards should do a good work that day.  Every few minutes a new

dispatch was bulletined from Gold Hill, and still the excitement grew.

Telegrams began to return to us from Virginia beseeching Gridley to bring

back the flour sack; but such was not the plan of the campaign.  At the

end of an hour Gold Hill's small population had paid a figure for the

flour sack that awoke all the enthusiasm of Virginia when the grand total

was displayed upon the bulletin boards.  Then the Gridley cavalcade moved

on, a giant refreshed with new lager beer and plenty of it--for the

people brought it to the carriages without waiting to measure it--and

within three hours more the expedition had carried Silver City and Dayton

by storm and was on its way back covered with glory.  Every move had been

telegraphed and bulletined, and as the procession entered Virginia and

filed down C street at half past eight in the evening the town was abroad

in the thoroughfares, torches were glaring, flags flying, bands playing,

cheer on cheer cleaving the air, and the city ready to surrender at

discretion.  The auction began, every bid was greeted with bursts of

applause, and at the end of two hours and a half a population of fifteen

thousand souls had paid in coin for a fifty-pound sack of flour a sum

equal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks!  It was at a rate in the

neighborhood of three dollars for each man, woman and child of the

population.  The grand total would have been twice as large, but the

streets were very narrow, and hundreds who wanted to bid could not get

within a block of the stand, and could not make themselves heard.  These

grew tired of waiting and many of them went home long before the auction

was over.  This was the greatest day Virginia ever saw, perhaps.



Gridley sold the sack in Carson city and several California towns; also

in San Francisco.  Then he took it east and sold it in one or two

Atlantic cities, I think.  I am not sure of that, but I know that he

finally carried it to St. Louis, where a monster Sanitary Fair was being

held, and after selling it there for a large sum and helping on the

enthusiasm by displaying the portly silver bricks which Nevada's donation

had produced, he had the flour baked up into small cakes and retailed

them at high prices.



It was estimated that when the flour sack's mission was ended it had been

sold for a grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in

greenbacks!  This is probably the only instance on record where common

family flour brought three thousand dollars a pound in the public market.



It is due to Mr. Gridley's memory to mention that the expenses of his

sanitary flour sack expedition of fifteen thousand miles, going and

returning, were paid in large part if not entirely, out of his own

pocket.  The time he gave to it was not less than three months.

Mr. Gridley was a soldier in the Mexican war and a pioneer Californian.

He died at Stockton, California, in December, 1870, greatly regretted.









CHAPTER XLVI.



There were nabobs in those days--in the "flush times," I mean.  Every

rich strike in the mines created one or two.  I call to mind several of

these.  They were careless, easy-going fellows, as a general thing, and

the community at large was as much benefited by their riches as they were

themselves--possibly more, in some cases.



Two cousins, teamsters, did some hauling for a man and had to take a

small segregated portion of a silver mine in lieu of $300 cash.  They

gave an outsider a third to open the mine, and they went on teaming.  But

not long.  Ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying each

owner $8,000 to $10,000 a month--say $100,000 a year.



One of the earliest nabobs that Nevada was delivered of wore $6,000 worth

of diamonds in his bosom, and swore he was unhappy because he could not

spend his money as fast as he made it.



Another Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached $16,000 a

month; and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine

that yielded it, for five dollars a day, when he first came to the

country.



The silver and sage-brush State has knowledge of another of these pets of

fortune--lifted from actual poverty to affluence almost in a single

night--who was able to offer $100,000 for a position of high official

distinction, shortly afterward, and did offer it--but failed to get it,

his politics not being as sound as his bank account.



Then there was John Smith.  He was a good, honest, kind-hearted soul,

born and reared in the lower ranks of life, and miraculously ignorant.

He drove a team, and owned a small ranch--a ranch that paid him a

comfortable living, for although it yielded but little hay, what little

it did yield was worth from $250 to $300 in gold per ton in the market.

Presently Smith traded a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped

silver mine in Gold Hill.  He opened the mine and built a little

unpretending ten-stamp mill.  Eighteen months afterward he retired from

the hay business, for his mining income had reached a most comfortable

figure.  Some people said it was $30,000 a month, and others said it was

$60,000.  Smith was very rich at any rate.



And then he went to Europe and traveled.  And when he came back he was

never tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in England, and

the gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain, and the fine cattle he had

noticed in the vicinity of Rome.  He was full of wonders of the old

world, and advised everybody to travel.  He said a man never imagined

what surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled.



One day, on board ship, the passengers made up a pool of $500, which was

to be the property of the man who should come nearest to guessing the run

of the vessel for the next twenty-four hours.  Next day, toward noon, the

figures were all in the purser's hands in sealed envelopes.  Smith was

serene and happy, for he had been bribing the engineer.  But another

party won the prize!  Smith said:



"Here, that won't do!  He guessed two miles wider of the mark than I did."



The purser said, "Mr. Smith, you missed it further than any man on board.

We traveled two hundred and eight miles yesterday."



"Well, sir," said Smith, "that's just where I've got you, for I guessed

two hundred and nine.  If you'll look at my figgers again you'll find a 2

and two 0's, which stands for 200, don't it?--and after 'em you'll find a

9 (2009), which stands for two hundred and nine.  I reckon I'll take that

money, if you please."



The Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and it all

belonged originally to the two men whose names it bears.  Mr. Curry owned

two thirds of it--and he said that he sold it out for twenty-five hundred

dollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in

hay and barley in seventeen days by the watch.  And he said that Gould

sold out for a pair of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of

whisky that killed nine men in three hours, and that an unoffending

stranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life.  Four years afterward

the mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven

millions six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin.



In the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon

directly back of Virginia City, had a stream of water as large as a man's

wrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises.  The Ophir Company

segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for the

stream of water.  The hundred feet proved to be the richest part of the

entire mine; four years after the swap, its market value (including its

mill) was $1,500,000.



An individual who owned twenty feet in the Ophir mine before its great

riches were revealed to men, traded it for a horse, and a very sorry

looking brute he was, too.  A year or so afterward, when Ophir stock went

up to $3,000 a foot, this man, who had not a cent, used to say he was the

most startling example of magnificence and misery the world had ever

seen--because he was able to ride a sixty-thousand-dollar horse--yet

could not scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle, and was obliged to

borrow one or ride bareback.  He said if fortune were to give him another

sixty-thousand-dollar horse it would ruin him.



A youth of nineteen, who was a telegraph operator in Virginia on a salary

of a hundred dollars a month, and who, when he could not make out German

names in the list of San Francisco steamer arrivals, used to ingeniously

select and supply substitutes for them out of an old Berlin city

directory, made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that passed

through his hands and buying and selling stocks accordingly, through a

friend in San Francisco.  Once when a private dispatch was sent from

Virginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising that

the matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be

secured, he bought forty "feet" of the stock at twenty dollars a foot,

and afterward sold half of it at eight hundred dollars a foot and the

rest at double that figure.  Within three months he was worth $150,000,

and had resigned his telegraphic position.



Another telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for

divulging the secrets of the office, agreed with a moneyed man in San

Francisco to furnish him the result of a great Virginia mining lawsuit

within an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in San

Francisco.  For this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on

purchases and sales made on it by his fellow-conspirator.  So he went,

disguised as a teamster, to a little wayside telegraph office in the

mountains, got acquainted with the operator, and sat in the office day

after day, smoking his pipe, complaining that his team was fagged out and

unable to travel--and meantime listening to the dispatches as they passed

clicking through the machine from Virginia.  Finally the private dispatch

announcing the result of the lawsuit sped over the wires, and as soon as

he heard it he telegraphed his friend in San Francisco:



"Am tired waiting.  Shall sell the team and go home."



It was the signal agreed upon.  The word "waiting" left out, would have

signified that the suit had gone the other way.



The mock teamster's friend picked up a deal of the mining stock, at low

figures, before the news became public, and a fortune was the result.



For a long time after one of the great Virginia mines had been

incorporated, about fifty feet of the original location were still in the

hands of a man who had never signed the incorporation papers.  The stock

became very valuable, and every effort was made to find this man, but he

had disappeared.  Once it was heard that he was in New York, and one or

two speculators went east but failed to find him.  Once the news came

that he was in the Bermudas, and straightway a speculator or two hurried

east and sailed for Bermuda--but he was not there.  Finally he was heard

of in Mexico, and a friend of his, a bar-keeper on a salary, scraped

together a little money and sought him out, bought his "feet" for a

hundred dollars, returned and sold the property for $75,000.



But why go on?  The traditions of Silverland are filled with instances

like these, and I would never get through enumerating them were I to

attempt do it.  I only desired to give, the reader an idea of a

peculiarity of the "flush times" which I could not present so strikingly

in any other way, and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing

comprehension of the time and the country.



I was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I have

referred to, and so, for old acquaintance sake, I have shifted their

occupations and experiences around in such a way as to keep the Pacific

public from recognizing these once notorious men.  No longer notorious,

for the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity

again.



In Nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two of

her nabobs, which may or may not have occurred.  I give it for what it is

worth:



Col. Jim had seen somewhat of the world, and knew more or less of its

ways; but Col. Jack was from the back settlements of the States, had led

a life of arduous toil, and had never seen a city.  These two, blessed

with sudden wealth, projected a visit to New York,--Col. Jack to see the

sights, and Col. Jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune.  They

reached San Francisco in the night, and sailed in the morning.  Arrived

in New York, Col.  Jack said:



"I've heard tell of carriages all my life, and now I mean to have a ride

in one; I don't care what it costs.  Come along."



They stepped out on the sidewalk, and Col. Jim called a stylish barouche.

But Col. Jack said:



"No, sir!  None of your cheap-John turn-outs for me.  I'm here to have a

good time, and money ain't any object.  I mean to have the nobbiest rig

that's going.  Now here comes the very trick.  Stop that yaller one with

the pictures on it--don't you fret--I'll stand all the expenses myself."



So Col. Jim stopped an empty omnibus, and they got in.  Said Col. Jack:



"Ain't it gay, though?  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Cushions, and windows, and

pictures, till you can't rest.  What would the boys say if they could see

us cutting a swell like this in New York?  By George, I wish they could

see us."



Then he put his head out of the window, and shouted to the driver:



"Say, Johnny, this suits me!--suits yours truly, you bet, you!  I want

this shebang all day.  I'm on it, old man!  Let 'em out!  Make 'em go!

We'll make it all right with you, sonny!"



The driver passed his hand through the strap-hole, and tapped for his

fare--it was before the gongs came into common use.  Col. Jack took the

hand, and shook it cordially.  He said:



"You twig me, old pard!  All right between gents.  Smell of that, and see

how you like it!"



And he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver's hand.  After a

moment the driver said he could not make change.



"Bother the change!  Ride it out.  Put it in your pocket."



Then to Col.  Jim, with a sounding slap on his thigh:



"Ain't it style, though?  Hanged if I don't hire this thing every day for

a week."



The omnibus stopped, and a young lady got in.  Col. Jack stared a moment,

then nudged Col. Jim with his elbow:



"Don't say a word," he whispered.  "Let her ride, if she wants to.

Gracious, there's room enough."



The young lady got out her porte-monnaie, and handed her fare to Col.

Jack.



"What's this for?"  said he.



"Give it to the driver, please."



"Take back your money, madam.  We can't allow it.  You're welcome to ride

here as long as you please, but this shebang's chartered, and we can't

let you pay a cent."



The girl shrunk into a corner, bewildered.  An old lady with a basket

climbed in, and proffered her fare.



"Excuse me," said Col. Jack.  "You're perfectly welcome here, madam, but

we can't allow you to pay.  Set right down there, mum, and don't you be

the least uneasy.  Make yourself just as free as if you was in your own

turn-out."



Within two minutes, three gentlemen, two fat women, and a couple of

children, entered.



"Come right along, friends," said Col.  Jack; "don't mind us.  This is a

free blow-out."  Then he whispered to Col.  Jim,



"New York ain't no sociable place, I don't reckon--it ain't no name for

it!"



He resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver, and made everybody

cordially welcome.  The situation dawned on the people, and they pocketed

their money, and delivered themselves up to covert enjoyment of the

episode.  Half a dozen more passengers entered.



"Oh, there's plenty of room," said Col.  Jack.  "Walk right in, and make

yourselves at home.  A blow-out ain't worth anything as a blow-out,

unless a body has company."  Then in a whisper to Col.  Jim: "But ain't

these New Yorkers friendly?  And ain't they cool about it, too?  Icebergs

ain't anywhere.  I reckon they'd tackle a hearse, if it was going their

way."



More passengers got in; more yet, and still more.  Both seats were

filled, and a file of men were standing up, holding on to the cleats

overhead.  Parties with baskets and bundles were climbing up on the roof.

Half-suppressed laughter rippled up from all sides.



"Well, for clean, cool, out-and-out cheek, if this don't bang anything

that ever I saw, I'm an Injun!" whispered Col. Jack.



A Chinaman crowded his way in.



"I weaken!" said Col. Jack.  "Hold on, driver!  Keep your seats, ladies,

and gents.  Just make yourselves free--everything's paid for.  Driver,

rustle these folks around as long as they're a mind to go--friends of

ours, you know.  Take them everywheres--and if you want more money, come

to the St. Nicholas, and we'll make it all right.  Pleasant journey to

you, ladies and gents--go it just as long as you please--it shan't cost

you a cent!"



The two comrades got out, and Col. Jack said:



"Jimmy, it's the sociablest place I ever saw.  The Chinaman waltzed in as

comfortable as anybody.  If we'd staid awhile, I reckon we'd had some

niggers.  B' George, we'll have to barricade our doors to-night, or some

of these ducks will be trying to sleep with us."









CHAPTER XLVII.



Somebody has said that in order to know a community, one must observe the

style of its funerals and know what manner of men they bury with most

ceremony.  I cannot say which class we buried with most eclat in our

"flush times," the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished

rough--possibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of society

honored their illustrious dead about equally; and hence, no doubt the

philosopher I have quoted from would have needed to see two

representative funerals in Virginia before forming his estimate of the

people.



There was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died.  He was a

representative citizen.  He had "killed his man"--not in his own quarrel,

it is true, but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers.

He had kept a sumptuous saloon.  He had been the proprietor of a dashing

helpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a divorce.

He had held a high position in the fire department and been a very

Warwick in politics.  When he died there was great lamentation throughout

the town, but especially in the vast bottom-stratum of society.



On the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the delirium of a

wasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, shot himself through the body,

cut his throat, and jumped out of a four-story window and broken his

neck--and after due deliberation, the jury, sad and tearful, but with

intelligence unblinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of death "by

the visitation of God."  What could the world do without juries?



Prodigious preparations were made for the funeral.  All the vehicles in

town were hired, all the saloons put in mourning, all the municipal and

fire-company flags hung at half-mast, and all the firemen ordered to

muster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black.  Now--

let us remark in parenthesis--as all the peoples of the earth had

representative adventurers in the Silverland, and as each adventurer had

brought the slang of his nation or his locality with him, the combination

made the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely varied and

copious that had ever existed anywhere in the world, perhaps, except in

the mines of California in the "early days."  Slang was the language of

Nevada.  It was hard to preach a sermon without it, and be understood.

Such phrases as "You bet!"  "Oh, no, I reckon not!"  "No Irish need

apply," and a hundred others, became so common as to fall from the lips

of a speaker unconsciously--and very often when they did not touch the

subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything.



After Buck Fanshaw's inquest, a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood

was held, for nothing can be done on the Pacific coast without a public

meeting and an expression of sentiment.  Regretful resolutions were

passed and various committees appointed; among others, a committee of one

was deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle, spiritual new

fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet unacquainted

with the ways of the mines.  The committeeman, "Scotty" Briggs, made his

visit; and in after days it was worth something to hear the minister tell

about it.  Scotty was a stalwart rough, whose customary suit, when on

weighty official business, like committee work, was a fire helmet,

flaming red flannel shirt, patent leather belt with spanner and revolver

attached, coat hung over arm, and pants stuffed into boot tops.

He formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student.  It is

fair to say of Scotty, however, in passing, that he had a warm heart, and

a strong love for his friends, and never entered into a quarrel when he

could reasonably keep out of it.  Indeed, it was commonly said that

whenever one of Scotty's fights was investigated, it always turned out

that it had originally been no affair of his, but that out of native

good-heartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who

was getting the worst of it.  He and Buck Fanshaw were bosom friends, for

years, and had often taken adventurous "pot-luck" together.  On one

occasion, they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a

fight among strangers, and after gaining a hard-earned victory, turned

and found that the men they were helping had deserted early, and not only

that, but had stolen their coats and made off with them!  But to return

to Scotty's visit to the minister.  He was on a sorrowful mission, now,

and his face was the picture of woe.  Being admitted to the presence he

sat down before the clergyman, placed his fire-hat on an unfinished

manuscript sermon under the minister's nose, took from it a red silk

handkerchief, wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness,

explanatory of his business.



He choked, and even shed tears; but with an effort he mastered his voice

and said in lugubrious tones:



"Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?"



"Am I the--pardon me, I believe I do not understand?"



With another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined:



"Why you see we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys thought maybe you

would give us a lift, if we'd tackle you--that is, if I've got the rights

of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door."



"I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door."



"The which?"



"The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary

adjoins these premises."



Scotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:



"You ruther hold over me, pard.  I reckon I can't call that hand.  Ante

and pass the buck."



"How? I beg pardon.  What did I understand you to say?"



"Well, you've ruther got the bulge on me.  Or maybe we've both got the

bulge, somehow.  You don't smoke me and I don't smoke you.  You see, one

of the boys has passed in his checks and we want to give him a good send-

off, and so the thing I'm on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a

little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome."



"My friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered.  Your observations

are wholly incomprehensible to me.  Cannot you simplify them in some way?

At first I thought perhaps I understood you, but I grope now.  Would it

not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements

of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and

allegory?"



Another pause, and more reflection.  Then, said Scotty:



"I'll have to pass, I judge."



"How?"



"You've raised me out, pard."



"I still fail to catch your meaning."



"Why, that last lead of yourn is too many for me--that's the idea.  I

can't neither-trump nor follow suit."



The clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed.  Scotty leaned his head

on his hand and gave himself up to thought.



Presently his face came up, sorrowful but confident.



"I've got it now, so's you can savvy," he said.  "What we want is a

gospel-sharp.  See?"



"A what?"



"Gospel-sharp.  Parson."



"Oh!  Why did you not say so before?  I am a clergyman--a parson."



"Now you talk!  You see my blind and straddle it like a man.  Put it

there!"--extending a brawny paw, which closed over the minister's small

hand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent

gratification.



"Now we're all right, pard.  Let's start fresh.  Don't you mind my

snuffling a little--becuz we're in a power of trouble.  You see, one of

the boys has gone up the flume--"



"Gone where?"



"Up the flume--throwed up the sponge, you understand."



"Thrown up the sponge?"



"Yes--kicked the bucket--"



"Ah--has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no

traveler returns."



"Return!  I reckon not.  Why pard, he's dead!"



"Yes, I understand."



"Oh, you do?  Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some

more.  Yes, you see he's dead again--"



"Again?  Why, has he ever been dead before?"



"Dead before?  No!  Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat?

But you bet you he's awful dead now, poor old boy, and I wish I'd never

seen this day.  I don't want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw.

I knowed him by the back; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to

him--you hear me.  Take him all round, pard, there never was a bullier

man in the mines.  No man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a

friend.  But it's all up, you know, it's all up.  It ain't no use.

They've scooped him."



"Scooped him?"



"Yes--death has.  Well, well, well, we've got to give him up.  Yes

indeed.  It's a kind of a hard world, after all, ain't it?  But pard, he

was a rustler!  You ought to seen him get started once.  He was a bully

boy with a glass eye!  Just spit in his face and give him room according

to his strength, and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in.

He was the worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath.  Pard, he was on

it!  He was on it bigger than an Injun!"



"On it?  On what?"



"On the shoot.  On the shoulder.  On the fight, you understand.

He didn't give a continental for any body.  Beg your pardon, friend, for

coming so near saying a cuss-word--but you see I'm on an awful strain, in

this palaver, on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so

mild.  But we've got to give him up.  There ain't any getting around

that, I don't reckon.  Now if we can get you to help plant him--"



"Preach the funeral discourse?  Assist at the obsequies?"



"Obs'quies is good.  Yes.  That's it--that's our little game.  We are

going to get the thing up regardless, you know.  He was always nifty

himself, and so you bet you his funeral ain't going to be no slouch--

solid silver door-plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and a

nigger on the box in a biled shirt and a plug hat--how's that for high?

And we'll take care of you, pard.  We'll fix you all right.  There'll be

a kerridge for you; and whatever you want, you just 'scape out and we'll

'tend to it.  We've got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind, in

No. 1's house, and don't you be afraid.  Just go in and toot your horn,

if you don't sell a clam.  Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard,

for anybody that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest

men that was ever in the mines.  You can't draw it too strong.  He never

could stand it to see things going wrong.  He's done more to make this

town quiet and peaceable than any man in it.  I've seen him lick four

Greasers in eleven minutes, myself.  If a thing wanted regulating, he

warn't a man to go browsing around after somebody to do it, but he would

prance in and regulate it himself.  He warn't a Catholic.  Scasely.  He

was down on 'em.  His word was, 'No Irish need apply!'  But it didn't

make no difference about that when it came down to what a man's rights

was--and so, when some roughs jumped the Catholic bone-yard and started

in to stake out town-lots in it he went for 'em!  And he cleaned 'em,

too!  I was there, pard, and I seen it myself."



"That was very well indeed--at least the impulse was--whether the act was

strictly defensible or not.  Had deceased any religious convictions?

That is to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance

to a higher power?"



More reflection.



"I reckon you've stumped me again, pard.  Could you say it over once

more, and say it slow?"



"Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been

connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and

devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?"



"All down but nine--set 'em up on the other alley, pard."



"What did I understand you to say?"



"Why, you're most too many for me, you know.  When you get in with your

left I hunt grass every time.  Every time you draw, you fill; but I don't

seem to have any luck.  Lets have a new deal."



"How?  Begin again?"



"That's it."



"Very well.  Was he a good man, and--"



"There--I see that; don't put up another chip till I look at my hand.

A good man, says you?  Pard, it ain't no name for it.  He was the best

man that ever--pard, you would have doted on that man.  He could lam any

galoot of his inches in America.  It was him that put down the riot last

election before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man

that could have done it.  He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a

trumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less

than three minutes.  He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice

before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow.  He was always for

peace, and he would have peace--he could not stand disturbances.  Pard,

he was a great loss to this town.  It would please the boys if you could

chip in something like that and do him justice.  Here once when the Micks

got to throwing stones through the Methodis' Sunday school windows, Buck

Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of

six-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school.  Says he, 'No

Irish need apply!'  And they didn't.  He was the bulliest man in the

mountains, pard!  He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold

more tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen

counties.  Put that in, pard--it'll please the boys more than anything

you could say.  And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother."



"Never shook his mother?"



"That's it--any of the boys will tell you so."



"Well, but why should he shake her?"



"That's what I say--but some people does."



"Not people of any repute?"



"Well, some that averages pretty so-so."



"In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own

mother, ought to--"



"Cheese it, pard; you've banked your ball clean outside the string.

What I was a drivin' at, was, that he never throwed off on his mother--

don't you see?  No indeedy.  He give her a house to live in, and town

lots, and plenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her

all the time; and when she was down with the small-pox I'm d---d if he

didn't set up nights and nuss her himself!  Beg your pardon for saying

it, but it hopped out too quick for yours truly.



"You've treated me like a gentleman, pard, and I ain't the man to hurt

your feelings intentional.  I think you're white.  I think you're a

square man, pard.  I like you, and I'll lick any man that don't.  I'll

lick him till he can't tell himself from a last year's corpse!  Put it

there!" [Another fraternal hand-shake--and exit.]



The obsequies were all that "the boys" could desire.  Such a marvel of

funeral pomp had never been seen in Virginia.  The plumed hearse, the

dirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags

drooping at half mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret

societies, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines,

carriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted

multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs and windows; and for

years afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in

Virginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw's funeral.



Scotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent place

at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of

the prayer for the dead man's soul ascended, he responded, in a low

voice, but with feelings:



"AMEN.  No Irish need apply."



As the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was

probably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend

that was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was "his word."



Scotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the

only convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs;

and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel

of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof

to construct a Christian.  The making him one did not warp his generosity

or diminish his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to

the one and a broader field to the other.



If his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes, was

it matter for wonder?  I think not.  He talked to his pioneer small-fry

in a language they understood!  It was my large privilege, a month before

he died, to hear him tell the beautiful story of Joseph and his brethren

to his class "without looking at the book."  I leave it to the reader to

fancy what it was like, as it fell, riddled with slang, from the lips of

that grave, earnest teacher, and was listened to by his little learners

with a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as he

was that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties!









CHAPTER XLVIII.



The first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by

murdered men.  So everybody said, so everybody believed, and so they will

always say and believe.  The reason why there was so much slaughtering

done, was, that in a new mining district the rough element predominates,

and a person is not respected until he has "killed his man."  That was

the very expression used.



If an unknown individual arrived, they did not inquire if he was capable,

honest, industrious, but--had he killed his man?  If he had not, he

gravitated to his natural and proper position, that of a man of small

consequence; if he had, the cordiality of his reception was graduated

according to the number of his dead.  It was tedious work struggling up

to a position of influence with bloodless hands; but when a man came with

the blood of half a dozen men on his soul, his worth was recognized at

once and his acquaintance sought.



In Nevada, for a time, the lawyer, the editor, the banker, the chief

desperado, the chief gambler, and the saloon keeper, occupied the same

level in society, and it was the highest.  The cheapest and easiest way

to become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at

large, was to stand behind a bar, wear a cluster-diamond pin, and sell

whisky.  I am not sure but that the saloon-keeper held a shade higher

rank than any other member of society.  His opinion had weight.  It was

his privilege to say how the elections should go.  No great movement

could succeed without the countenance and direction of the saloon-

keepers.  It was a high favor when the chief saloon-keeper consented to

serve in the legislature or the board of aldermen.



Youthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law, or the

army and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon.



To be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious.  Hence the

reader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed

in Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation, so impatient was the

slayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being

held in indifferent repute by his associates.  I knew two youths who

tried to "kill their men" for no other reason--and got killed themselves

for their pains.  "There goes the man that killed Bill Adams" was higher

praise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any

other speech that admiring lips could utter.



The men who murdered Virginia's original twenty-six cemetery-occupants

were never punished.  Why?  Because Alfred the Great, when he invented

trial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice

in his age of the world, was not aware that in the nineteenth century the

condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from

the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency, it would prove

the most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that human

wisdom could contrive.  For how could he imagine that we simpletons would

go on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it of its

usefulness, any more than he could imagine that we would go on using his

candle-clock after we had invented chronometers?  In his day news could

not travel fast, and hence he could easily find a jury of honest,

intelligent men who had not heard of the case they were called to try--

but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan compels us to swear

in juries composed of fools and rascals, because the system rigidly

excludes honest men and men of brains.



I remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we call a

jury trial.  A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most

wanton and cold-blooded way.  Of course the papers were full of it, and

all men capable of reading, read about it.  And of course all men not

deaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it.  A jury-list was made out,

and Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned

precisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America:



"Have you heard of this homicide?"



"Yes."



"Have you held conversations upon the subject?"



"Yes."



"Have you formed or expressed opinions about it?"



"Yes."



"Have you read the newspaper accounts of it?"



"Yes."



"We do not want you."



A minister, intelligent, esteemed, and greatly respected; a merchant of

high character and known probity; a mining superintendent of intelligence

and unblemished reputation; a quartz mill owner of excellent standing,

were all questioned in the same way, and all set aside.  Each said the

public talk and the newspaper reports had not so biased his mind but that

sworn testimony would overthrow his previously formed opinions and enable

him to render a verdict without prejudice and in accordance with the

facts.  But of course such men could not be trusted with the case.

Ignoramuses alone could mete out unsullied justice.



When the peremptory challenges were all exhausted, a jury of twelve men

was impaneled--a jury who swore they had neither heard, read, talked

about nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder which the very cattle

in the corrals, the Indians in the sage-brush and the stones in the

streets were cognizant of!  It was a jury composed of two desperadoes,

two low beer-house politicians, three bar-keepers, two ranchmen who could

not read, and three dull, stupid, human donkeys!  It actually came out

afterward, that one of these latter thought that incest and arson were

the same thing.



The verdict rendered by this jury was, Not Guilty.  What else could one

expect?



The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty, and a premium

upon ignorance, stupidity and perjury.  It is a shame that we must

continue to use a worthless system because it was good a thousand years

ago.  In this age, when a gentleman of high social standing, intelligence

and probity, swears that testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh,

with him, street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay, he

is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own ignorance and

stupidity, and justice would be far safer in his hands than in theirs.

Why could not the jury law be so altered as to give men of brains and

honesty and equal chance with fools and miscreants?  Is it right to show

the present favoritism to one class of men and inflict a disability on

another, in a land whose boast is that all its citizens are free and

equal?  I am a candidate for the legislature.  I desire to tamper with

the jury law.  I wish to so alter it as to put a premium on intelligence

and character, and close the jury box against idiots, blacklegs, and

people who do not read newspapers.  But no doubt I shall be defeated--

every effort I make to save the country "misses fire."



My idea, when I began this chapter, was to say something about

desperadoism in the "flush times" of Nevada.  To attempt a portrayal of

that era and that land, and leave out the blood and carnage, would be

like portraying Mormondom and leaving out polygamy.  The desperado

stalked the streets with a swagger graded according to the number of his

homicides, and a nod of recognition from him was sufficient to make a

humble admirer happy for the rest of the day.  The deference that was

paid to a desperado of wide reputation, and who "kept his private

graveyard," as the phrase went, was marked, and cheerfully accorded.

When he moved along the sidewalk in his excessively long-tailed frock-

coat, shiny stump-toed boots, and with dainty little slouch hat tipped

over left eye, the small-fry roughs made room for his majesty; when he

entered the restaurant, the waiters deserted bankers and merchants to

overwhelm him with obsequious service; when he shouldered his way to a

bar, the shouldered parties wheeled indignantly, recognized him, and--

apologized.



They got a look in return that froze their marrow, and by that time a

curled and breast-pinned bar keeper was beaming over the counter, proud

of the established acquaintanceship that permitted such a familiar form

of speech as:



"How're ye, Billy, old fel?  Glad to see you.  What'll you take--the old

thing?"



The "old thing" meant his customary drink, of course.



The best known names in the Territory of Nevada were those belonging to

these long-tailed heroes of the revolver.  Orators, Governors,

capitalists and leaders of the legislature enjoyed a degree of fame, but

it seemed local and meagre when contrasted with the fame of such men as

Sam Brown, Jack Williams, Billy Mulligan, Farmer Pease, Sugarfoot Mike,

Pock Marked Jake, El Dorado Johnny, Jack McNabb, Joe McGee, Jack Harris,

Six-fingered Pete, etc., etc.  There was a long list of them.  They were

brave, reckless men, and traveled with their lives in their hands.  To

give them their due, they did their killing principally among themselves,

and seldom molested peaceable citizens, for they considered it small

credit to add to their trophies so cheap a bauble as the death of a man

who was "not on the shoot," as they phrased it.  They killed each other

on slight provocation, and hoped and expected to be killed themselves--

for they held it almost shame to die otherwise than "with their boots

on," as they expressed it.



I remember an instance of a desperado's contempt for such small game as a

private citizen's life.  I was taking a late supper in a restaurant one

night, with two reporters and a little printer named--Brown, for

instance--any name will do.  Presently a stranger with a long-tailed coat

on came in, and not noticing Brown's hat, which was lying in a chair, sat

down on it.  Little Brown sprang up and became abusive in a moment.  The

stranger smiled, smoothed out the hat, and offered it to Brown with

profuse apologies couched in caustic sarcasm, and begged Brown not to

destroy him.  Brown threw off his coat and challenged the man to fight--

abused him, threatened him, impeached his courage, and urged and even

implored him to fight; and in the meantime the smiling stranger placed

himself under our protection in mock distress.  But presently he assumed

a serious tone, and said:



"Very well, gentlemen, if we must fight, we must, I suppose.  But don't

rush into danger and then say I gave you no warning.  I am more than a

match for all of you when I get started.  I will give you proofs, and

then if my friend here still insists, I will try to accommodate him."



The table we were sitting at was about five feet long, and unusually

cumbersome and heavy.  He asked us to put our hands on the dishes and

hold them in their places a moment--one of them was a large oval dish

with a portly roast on it.  Then he sat down, tilted up one end of the

table, set two of the legs on his knees, took the end of the table

between his teeth, took his hands away, and pulled down with his teeth

till the table came up to a level position, dishes and all!  He said he

could lift a keg of nails with his teeth.  He picked up a common glass

tumbler and bit a semi-circle out of it.  Then he opened his bosom and

showed us a net-work of knife and bullet scars; showed us more on his

arms and face, and said he believed he had bullets enough in his body to

make a pig of lead.  He was armed to the teeth.  He closed with the

remark that he was Mr. ---- of Cariboo--a celebrated name whereat we shook

in our shoes.  I would publish the name, but for the suspicion that he

might come and carve me.  He finally inquired if Brown still thirsted for

blood.  Brown turned the thing over in his mind a moment, and then--asked

him to supper.



With the permission of the reader, I will group together, in the next

chapter, some samples of life in our small mountain village in the old

days of desperadoism.  I was there at the time.  The reader will observe

peculiarities in our official society; and he will observe also, an

instance of how, in new countries, murders breed murders.









CHAPTER XLIX.



An extract or two from the newspapers of the day will furnish a

photograph that can need no embellishment:



      FATAL SHOOTING AFFRAY.--An affray occurred, last evening, in a

      billiard saloon on C street, between Deputy Marshal Jack Williams

      and Wm. Brown, which resulted in the immediate death of the latter.

      There had been some difficulty between the parties for several

      months.



      An inquest was immediately held, and the following testimony

      adduced:



      Officer GEO. BIRDSALL, sworn, says:--I was told Wm. Brown was drunk

      and was looking for Jack Williams; so soon as I heard that I started

      for the parties to prevent a collision; went into the billiard

      saloon; saw Billy Brown running around, saying if anybody had

      anything against him to show cause; he was talking in a boisterous

      manner, and officer Perry took him to the other end of the room to

      talk to him; Brown came back to me; remarked to me that he thought

      he was as good as anybody, and knew how to take care of himself; he

      passed by me and went to the bar; don't know whether he drank or

      not; Williams was at the end of the billiard-table, next to the

      stairway; Brown, after going to the bar, came back and said he was

      as good as any man in the world; he had then walked out to the end

      of the first billiard-table from the bar; I moved closer to them,

      supposing there would be a fight; as Brown drew his pistol I caught

      hold of it; he had fired one shot at Williams; don't know the effect

      of it; caught hold of him with one hand, and took hold of the pistol

      and turned it up; think he fired once after I caught hold of the

      pistol; I wrenched the pistol from him; walked to the end of the

      billiard-table and told a party that I had Brown's pistol, and to

      stop shooting; I think four shots were fired in all; after walking

      out, Mr. Foster remarked that Brown was shot dead.



Oh, there was no excitement about it--he merely "remarked" the small

circumstance!



Four months later the following item appeared in the same paper (the

Enterprise).  In this item the name of one of the city officers above

referred to (Deputy Marshal Jack Williams) occurs again:



      ROBBERY AND DESPERATE AFFRAY.--On Tuesday night, a German named

      Charles Hurtzal, engineer in a mill at Silver City, came to this

      place, and visited the hurdy-gurdy house on B street.  The music,

      dancing and Teutonic maidens awakened memories of Faderland until

      our German friend was carried away with rapture.  He evidently had

      money, and was spending if freely.  Late in the evening Jack

      Williams and Andy Blessington invited him down stairs to take a cup

      of coffee.  Williams proposed a game of cards and went up stairs to

      procure a deck, but not finding any returned.  On the stairway he

      met the German, and drawing his pistol knocked him down and rifled

      his pockets of some seventy dollars.  Hurtzal dared give no alarm,

      as he was told, with a pistol at his head, if he made any noise or

      exposed them, they would blow his brains out.  So effectually was he

      frightened that he made no complaint, until his friends forced him.

      Yesterday a warrant was issued, but the culprits had disappeared.



This efficient city officer, Jack Williams, had the common reputation of

being a burglar, a highwayman and a desperado.  It was said that he had

several times drawn his revolver and levied money contributions on

citizens at dead of night in the public streets of Virginia.



Five months after the above item appeared, Williams was assassinated

while sitting at a card table one night; a gun was thrust through the

crack of the door and Williams dropped from his chair riddled with balls.

It was said, at the time, that Williams had been for some time aware that

a party of his own sort (desperadoes) had sworn away his life; and it was

generally believed among the people that Williams's friends and enemies

would make the assassination memorable--and useful, too--by a wholesale

destruction of each other.



It did not so happen, but still, times were not dull during the next

twenty-four hours, for within that time a woman was killed by a pistol

shot, a man was brained with a slung shot, and a man named Reeder was

also disposed of permanently.  Some matters in the Enterprise account of

the killing of Reeder are worth nothing--especially the accommodating

complaisance of a Virginia justice of the peace.  The italics in the

following narrative are mine:



      MORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING.--The devil seems to have again broken

      loose in our town.  Pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our

      streets as in early times.  When there has been a long season of

      quiet, people are slow to wet their hands in blood; but once blood

      is spilled, cutting and shooting come easy.  Night before last Jack

      Williams was assassinated, and yesterday forenoon we had more bloody

      work, growing out of the killing of Williams, and on the same street

      in which he met his death.  It appears that Tom Reeder, a friend of

      Williams, and George Gumbert were talking, at the meat market of the

      latter, about the killing of Williams the previous night, when

      Reeder said it was a most cowardly act to shoot a man in such a way,

      giving him "no show."  Gumbert said that Williams had "as good a

      show as he gave Billy Brown," meaning the man killed by Williams

      last March.  Reeder said it was a d---d lie, that Williams had no

      show at all.  At this, Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed Reeder,

      cutting him in two places in the back.  One stroke of the knife cut

      into the sleeve of Reeder's coat and passed downward in a slanting

      direction through his clothing, and entered his body at the small of

      the back; another blow struck more squarely, and made a much more

      dangerous wound.  Gumbert gave himself up to the officers of

      justice, and was shortly after discharged by Justice Atwill, on his

      own recognizance, to appear for trial at six o'clock in the evening.

      In the meantime Reeder had been taken into the office of Dr. Owens,

      where his wounds were properly dressed.  One of his wounds was

      considered quite dangerous, and it was thought by many that it would

      prove fatal.  But being considerably under the influence of liquor,

      Reeder did not feel his wounds as he otherwise would, and he got up

      and went into the street.  He went to the meat market and renewed

      his quarrel with Gumbert, threatening his life.  Friends tried to

      interfere to put a stop to the quarrel and get the parties away from

      each other.  In the Fashion Saloon Reeder made threats against the

      life of Gumbert, saying he would kill him, and it is said that he

      requested the officers not to arrest Gumbert, as he intended to kill

      him.  After these threats Gumbert went off and procured a double-

      barreled shot gun, loaded with buck-shot or revolver balls, and went

      after Reeder.  Two or three persons were assisting him along the

      street, trying to get him home, and had him just in front of the

      store of Klopstock & Harris, when Gumbert came across toward him

      from the opposite side of the street with his gun.  He came up

      within about ten or fifteen feet of Reeder, and called out to those

      with him to "look out! get out of the way!" and they had only time

      to heed the warning, when he fired.  Reeder was at the time

      attempting to screen himself behind a large cask, which stood

      against the awning post of Klopstock & Harris's store, but some of

      the balls took effect in the lower part of his breast, and he reeled

      around forward and fell in front of the cask.  Gumbert then raised

      his gun and fired the second barrel, which missed Reeder and entered

      the ground.  At the time that this occurred, there were a great many

      persons on the street in the vicinity, and a number of them called

      out to Gumbert, when they saw him raise his gun, to "hold on," and

      "don't shoot!"  The cutting took place about ten o'clock and the

      shooting about twelve.  After the shooting the street was instantly

      crowded with the inhabitants of that part of the town, some

      appearing much excited and laughing--declaring that it looked like

      the "good old times of '60."  Marshal Perry and officer Birdsall

      were near when the shooting occurred, and Gumbert was immediately

      arrested and his gun taken from him, when he was marched off to

      jail.  Many persons who were attracted to the spot where this bloody

      work had just taken place, looked bewildered and seemed to be asking

      themselves what was to happen next, appearing in doubt as to whether

      the killing mania had reached its climax, or whether we were to turn

      in and have a grand killing spell, shooting whoever might have given

      us offence.  It was whispered around that it was not all over yet--

      five or six more were to be killed before night.  Reeder was taken

      to the Virginia City Hotel, and doctors called in to examine his

      wounds.  They found that two or three balls had entered his right

      side; one of them appeared to have passed through the substance of

      the lungs, while another passed into the liver.  Two balls were also

      found to have struck one of his legs.  As some of the balls struck

      the cask, the wounds in Reeder's leg were probably from these,

      glancing downwards, though they might have been caused by the second

      shot fired.  After being shot, Reeder said when he got on his feet--

      smiling as he spoke--"It will take better shooting than that to kill

      me."  The doctors consider it almost impossible for him to recover,

      but as he has an excellent constitution he may survive,

      notwithstanding the number and dangerous character of the wounds he

      has received.  The town appears to be perfectly quiet at present, as

      though the late stormy times had cleared our moral atmosphere; but

      who can tell in what quarter clouds are lowering or plots ripening?



Reeder--or at least what was left of him--survived his wounds two days!

Nothing was ever done with Gumbert.



Trial by jury is the palladium of our liberties.  I do not know what a

palladium is, having never seen a palladium, but it is a good thing no

doubt at any rate.  Not less than a hundred men have been murdered in

Nevada--perhaps I would be within bounds if I said three hundred--and as

far as I can learn, only two persons have suffered the death penalty

there.  However, four or five who had no money and no political influence

have been punished by imprisonment--one languished in prison as much as

eight months, I think.  However, I do not desire to be extravagant--it

may have been less.



However, one prophecy was verified, at any rate.  It was asserted by the

desperadoes that one of their brethren (Joe McGee, a special policeman)

was known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate Williams;

and they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against McGee, and

that he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that had been

adopted for the destruction of Williams--a prophecy which came true a

year later.  After twelve months of distress (for McGee saw a fancied

assassin in every man that approached him), he made the last of many

efforts to get out of the country unwatched.  He went to Carson and sat

down in a saloon to wait for the stage--it would leave at four in the

morning.  But as the night waned and the crowd thinned, he grew uneasy,

and told the bar-keeper that assassins were on his track.  The bar-keeper

told him to stay in the middle of the room, then, and not go near the

door, or the window by the stove.  But a fatal fascination seduced him to

the neighborhood of the stove every now and then, and repeatedly the bar-

keeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to

remain there.  But he could not.  At three in the morning he again

returned to the stove and sat down by a stranger.  Before the bar-keeper

could get to him with another warning whisper, some one outside fired

through the window and riddled McGee's breast with slugs, killing him

almost instantly.  By the same discharge the stranger at McGee's side

also received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or three

days.









CHAPTER L.



These murder and jury statistics remind me of a certain very

extraordinary trial and execution of twenty years ago; it is a scrap of

history familiar to all old Californians, and worthy to be known by other

peoples of the earth that love simple, straightforward justice

unencumbered with nonsense.  I would apologize for this digression but

for the fact that the information I am about to offer is apology enough

in itself.  And since I digress constantly anyhow, perhaps it is as well

to eschew apologies altogether and thus prevent their growing irksome.



Capt. Ned Blakely--that name will answer as well as any other fictitious

one (for he was still with the living at last accounts, and may not

desire to be famous)--sailed ships out of the harbor of San Francisco for

many years.  He was a stalwart, warm-hearted, eagle-eyed veteran, who had

been a sailor nearly fifty years--a sailor from early boyhood.  He was a

rough, honest creature, full of pluck, and just as full of hard-headed

simplicity, too.  He hated trifling conventionalities--"business" was the

word, with him.  He had all a sailor's vindictiveness against the quips

and quirks of the law, and steadfastly believed that the first and last

aim and object of the law and lawyers was to defeat justice.



He sailed for the Chincha Islands in command of a guano ship.  He had a

fine crew, but his negro mate was his pet--on him he had for years

lavished his admiration and esteem.  It was Capt. Ned's first voyage to

the Chinchas, but his fame had gone before him--the fame of being a man

who would fight at the dropping of a handkerchief, when imposed upon, and

would stand no nonsense.  It was a fame well earned.  Arrived in the

islands, he found that the staple of conversation was the exploits of one

Bill Noakes, a bully, the mate of a trading ship.  This man had created a

small reign of terror there.  At nine o'clock at night, Capt. Ned, all

alone, was pacing his deck in the starlight.  A form ascended the side,

and approached him.  Capt. Ned said:



"Who goes there?"



"I'm Bill Noakes, the best man in the islands."



"What do you want aboard this ship?"



"I've heard of Capt. Ned Blakely, and one of us is a better man than

'tother--I'll know which, before I go ashore."



"You've come to the right shop--I'm your man.  I'll learn you to come

aboard this ship without an invite."



He seized Noakes, backed him against the mainmast, pounded his face to a

pulp, and then threw him overboard.



Noakes was not convinced.  He returned the next night, got the pulp

renewed, and went overboard head first, as before.



He was satisfied.



A week after this, while Noakes was carousing with a sailor crowd on

shore, at noonday, Capt. Ned's colored mate came along, and Noakes tried

to pick a quarrel with him.  The negro evaded the trap, and tried to get

away.  Noakes followed him up; the negro began to run; Noakes fired on

him with a revolver and killed him.  Half a dozen sea-captains witnessed

the whole affair.  Noakes retreated to the small after-cabin of his ship,

with two other bullies, and gave out that death would be the portion of

any man that intruded there.  There was no attempt made to follow the

villains; there was no disposition to do it, and indeed very little

thought of such an enterprise.  There were no courts and no officers;

there was no government; the islands belonged to Peru, and Peru was far

away; she had no official representative on the ground; and neither had

any other nation.



However, Capt. Ned was not perplexing his head about such things.  They

concerned him not.  He was boiling with rage and furious for justice.

At nine o'clock at night he loaded a double-barreled gun with slugs,

fished out a pair of handcuffs, got a ship's lantern, summoned his

quartermaster, and went ashore.  He said:



"Do you see that ship there at the dock?"



"Ay-ay, sir."



"It's the Venus."



"Ay-ay, sir."



"You--you know me."



"Ay-ay, sir."



"Very well, then.  Take the lantern.  Carry it just under your chin.

I'll walk behind you and rest this gun-barrel on your shoulder, p'inting

forward--so.  Keep your lantern well up so's I can see things ahead of

you good.  I'm going to march in on Noakes--and take him--and jug the

other chaps.  If you flinch--well, you know me."



"Ay-ay, sir."



In this order they filed aboard softly, arrived at Noakes's den, the

quartermaster pushed the door open, and the lantern revealed the three

desperadoes sitting on the floor.  Capt.  Ned said:



"I'm Ned Blakely.  I've got you under fire.  Don't you move without

orders--any of you.  You two kneel down in the corner; faces to the wall

--now.  Bill Noakes, put these handcuffs on; now come up close.

Quartermaster, fasten 'em.  All right.  Don't stir, sir.  Quartermaster,

put the key in the outside of the door.  Now, men, I'm going to lock you

two in; and if you try to burst through this door--well, you've heard of

me.  Bill Noakes, fall in ahead, and march.  All set.  Quartermaster,

lock the door."



Noakes spent the night on board Blakely's ship, a prisoner under strict

guard.  Early in the morning Capt. Ned called in all the sea-captains in

the harbor and invited them, with nautical ceremony, to be present on

board his ship at nine o'clock to witness the hanging of Noakes at the

yard-arm!



"What!  The man has not been tried."



"Of course he hasn't.  But didn't he kill the nigger?"



"Certainly he did; but you are not thinking of hanging him without a

trial?"



"Trial!  What do I want to try him for, if he killed the nigger?"



"Oh, Capt.  Ned, this will never do.  Think how it will sound."



"Sound be hanged!  Didn't he kill the nigger?"



"Certainly, certainly, Capt.  Ned,--nobody denies that,--but--"



"Then I'm going to hang him, that's all.  Everybody I've talked to talks

just the same way you do.  Everybody says he killed the nigger, everybody

knows he killed the nigger, and yet every lubber of you wants him tried

for it.  I don't understand such bloody foolishness as that.  Tried!

Mind you, I don't object to trying him, if it's got to be done to give

satisfaction; and I'll be there, and chip in and help, too; but put it

off till afternoon--put it off till afternoon, for I'll have my hands

middling full till after the burying--"



"Why, what do you mean?  Are you going to hang him any how--and try him

afterward?"



"Didn't I say I was going to hang him?  I never saw such people as you.

What's the difference?  You ask a favor, and then you ain't satisfied

when you get it.  Before or after's all one--you know how the trial will

go.  He killed the nigger.  Say--I must be going.  If your mate would

like to come to the hanging, fetch him along.  I like him."



There was a stir in the camp.  The captains came in a body and pleaded

with Capt. Ned not to do this rash thing.  They promised that they would

create a court composed of captains of the best character; they would

empanel a jury; they would conduct everything in a way becoming the

serious nature of the business in hand, and give the case an impartial

hearing and the accused a fair trial.  And they said it would be murder,

and punishable by the American courts if he persisted and hung the

accused on his ship.  They pleaded hard.  Capt. Ned said:



"Gentlemen, I'm not stubborn and I'm not unreasonable.  I'm always

willing to do just as near right as I can.  How long will it take?"



"Probably only a little while."



"And can I take him up the shore and hang him as soon as you are done?"



"If he is proven guilty he shall be hanged without unnecessary delay."



"If he's proven guilty.  Great Neptune, ain't he guilty?  This beats my

time.  Why you all know he's guilty."



But at last they satisfied him that they were projecting nothing

underhanded.  Then he said:



"Well, all right.  You go on and try him and I'll go down and overhaul

his conscience and prepare him to go--like enough he needs it, and I

don't want to send him off without a show for hereafter."



This was another obstacle.  They finally convinced him that it was

necessary to have the accused in court.  Then they said they would send a

guard to bring him.



"No, sir, I prefer to fetch him myself--he don't get out of my hands.

Besides, I've got to go to the ship to get a rope, anyway."



The court assembled with due ceremony, empaneled a jury, and presently

Capt. Ned entered, leading the prisoner with one hand and carrying a

Bible and a rope in the other.  He seated himself by the side of his

captive and told the court to "up anchor and make sail."  Then he turned

a searching eye on the jury, and detected Noakes's friends, the two

bullies.



He strode over and said to them confidentially:



"You're here to interfere, you see.  Now you vote right, do you hear?--or

else there'll be a double-barreled inquest here when this trial's off,

and your remainders will go home in a couple of baskets."



The caution was not without fruit.  The jury was a unit--the verdict.

"Guilty."



Capt.  Ned sprung to his feet and said:



"Come along--you're my meat now, my lad, anyway.  Gentlemen you've done

yourselves proud.  I invite you all to come and see that I do it all

straight.  Follow me to the canyon, a mile above here."



The court informed him that a sheriff had been appointed to do the

hanging, and--



Capt.  Ned's patience was at an end.  His wrath was boundless.  The

subject of a sheriff was judiciously dropped.



When the crowd arrived at the canyon, Capt. Ned climbed a tree and

arranged the halter, then came down and noosed his man.  He opened his

Bible, and laid aside his hat.  Selecting a chapter at random, he read it

through, in a deep bass voice and with sincere solemnity.  Then he said:



"Lad, you are about to go aloft and give an account of yourself; and the

lighter a man's manifest is, as far as sin's concerned, the better for

him.  Make a clean breast, man, and carry a log with you that'll bear

inspection.  You killed the nigger?"



No reply.  A long pause.



The captain read another chapter, pausing, from time to time, to impress

the effect.  Then he talked an earnest, persuasive sermon to him, and

ended by repeating the question:



"Did you kill the nigger?"



No reply--other than a malignant scowl.  The captain now read the first

and second chapters of Genesis, with deep feeling--paused a moment,

closed the book reverently, and said with a perceptible savor of

satisfaction:



"There.  Four chapters.  There's few that would have took the pains with

you that I have."



Then he swung up the condemned, and made the rope fast; stood by and

timed him half an hour with his watch, and then delivered the body to the

court.  A little after, as he stood contemplating the motionless figure,

a doubt came into his face; evidently he felt a twinge of conscience--a

misgiving--and he said with a sigh:



"Well, p'raps I ought to burnt him, maybe.  But I was trying to do for

the best."



When the history of this affair reached California (it was in the "early

days") it made a deal of talk, but did not diminish the captain's

popularity in any degree.  It increased it, indeed.  California had a

population then that "inflicted" justice after a fashion that was

simplicity and primitiveness itself, and could therefore admire

appreciatively when the same fashion was followed elsewhere.









CHAPTER LI.



Vice flourished luxuriantly during the hey-day of our "flush times."  The

saloons were overburdened with custom; so were the police courts, the

gambling dens, the brothels and the jails--unfailing signs of high

prosperity in a mining region--in any region for that matter.  Is it not

so?  A crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade

is brisk and money plenty.  Still, there is one other sign; it comes

last, but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the "flush

times" are at the flood.  This is the birth of the "literary" paper.

The Weekly Occidental, "devoted to literature," made its appearance in

Virginia.  All the literary people were engaged to write for it.  Mr. F.

was to edit it.  He was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen, and a man who

could say happy things in a crisp, neat way.  Once, while editor of the

Union, he had disposed of a labored, incoherent, two-column attack made

upon him by a contemporary, with a single line, which, at first glance,

seemed to contain a solemn and tremendous compliment--viz.: "THE LOGIC OF

OUR ADVERSARY RESEMBLES THE PEACE OF GOD,"--and left it to the reader's

memory and after-thought to invest the remark with another and "more

different" meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure the

rest of the Scripture--" in that it passeth understanding."  He once said

of a little, half-starved, wayside community that had no subsistence

except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers who stopped

over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage, that in their

Church service they had altered the Lord's Prayer to read: "Give us this

day our daily stranger!"



We expected great things of the Occidental.  Of course it could not get

along without an original novel, and so we made arrangements to hurl into

the work the full strength of the company.  Mrs. F. was an able romancist

of the ineffable school--I know no other name to apply to a school whose

heroes are all dainty and all perfect.  She wrote the opening chapter,

and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked nothing but pearls

and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of eccentricity.  She also

introduced a young French Duke of aggravated refinement, in love with the

blonde.  Mr. F. followed next week, with a brilliant lawyer who set about

getting the Duke's estates into trouble, and a sparkling young lady of

high society who fell to fascinating the Duke and impairing the appetite

of the blonde.  Mr. D., a dark and bloody editor of one of the dailies,

followed Mr. F., the third  week, introducing a mysterious Roscicrucian

who transmuted metals, held consultations with the devil in a cave at

dead of night, and cast the horoscope of the several heroes and heroines

in such a way as to provide plenty of trouble for their future careers

and breed a solemn and awful public interest in the novel.  He also

introduced a cloaked and masked melodramatic miscreant, put him on a

salary and set him on the midnight track of the Duke with a poisoned

dagger.  He also created an Irish coachman with a rich brogue and placed

him in the service of the society-young-lady with an ulterior mission to

carry billet-doux to the Duke.



About this time there arrived in Virginia a dissolute stranger with a

literary turn of mind--rather seedy he was, but very quiet and

unassuming; almost diffident, indeed.  He was so gentle, and his manners

were so pleasing and kindly, whether he was sober or intoxicated, that he

made friends of all who came in contact with him.  He applied for

literary work, offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and

practiced pen, and so Mr. F. engaged him at once to help write the novel.

His chapter was to follow Mr. D.'s, and mine was to come next.  Now what

does this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed to his

quarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of chaos, and

that chaos in a condition of extravagant activity.  The result may be

guessed.  He scanned the chapters of his predecessors, found plenty of

heroes and heroines already created, and was satisfied with them; he

decided to introduce no more; with all the confidence that whisky

inspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant, he then

launched himself lovingly into his work: he married the coachman to the

society-young-lady for the sake of the scandal; married the Duke to the

blonde's stepmother, for the sake of the sensation; stopped the

desperado's salary; created a misunderstanding between the devil and the

Roscicrucian; threw the Duke's property into the wicked lawyer's hands;

made the lawyer's upbraiding conscience drive him to drink, thence to

delirium tremens, thence to suicide; broke the coachman's neck; let his

widow succumb to contumely, neglect, poverty and consumption; caused the

blonde to drown herself, leaving her clothes on the bank with the

customary note pinned to them forgiving the Duke and hoping he would be

happy; revealed to the Duke, by means of the usual strawberry mark on

left arm, that he had married his own long-lost mother and destroyed his

long-lost sister; instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the Duke

and the Duchess in order to compass poetical justice; opened the earth

and let the Roscicrucian through, accompanied with the accustomed smoke

and thunder and smell of brimstone, and finished with the promise that in

the next chapter, after holding a general inquest, he would take up the

surviving character of the novel and tell what became of the devil!

It read with singular smoothness, and with a "dead" earnestness that was

funny enough to suffocate a body.  But there was war when it came in.

The other novelists were furious.  The mild stranger, not yet more than

half sober, stood there, under a scathing fire of vituperation, meek and

bewildered, looking from one to another of his assailants, and wondering

what he could have done to invoke such a storm.  When a lull came at

last, he said his say gently and appealingly--said he did not rightly

remember what he had written, but was sure he had tried to do the best he

could, and knew his object had been to make the novel not only pleasant

and plausible but instructive and----



The bombardment began again.  The novelists assailed his ill-chosen

adjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and ridicule.

And so the siege went on.  Every time the stranger tried to appease the

enemy he only made matters worse.  Finally he offered to rewrite the

chapter.  This arrested hostilities.  The indignation gradually quieted

down, peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in safety and got him

to his own citadel.



But on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk again.

And again his imagination went mad.  He led the heroes and heroines a

wilder dance than ever; and yet all through it ran that same convincing

air of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first work.  He got

the characters into the most extraordinary situations, put them through

the most surprising performances, and made them talk the strangest talk!

But the chapter cannot be described.  It was symmetrically crazy; it was

artistically absurd; and it had explanatory footnotes that were fully as

curious as the text.  I remember one of the "situations," and will offer

it as an example of the whole.  He altered the character of the brilliant

lawyer, and made him a great-hearted, splendid fellow; gave him fame and

riches, and set his age at thirty-three years.  Then he made the blonde

discover, through the help of the Roscicrucian and the melodramatic

miscreant, that while the Duke loved her money ardently and wanted it, he

secretly felt a sort of leaning toward the society-young-lady.  Stung to

the quick, she tore her affections from him and bestowed them with

tenfold power upon the lawyer, who responded with consuming zeal.  But

the parents would none of it.  What they wanted in the family was a Duke;

and a Duke they were determined to have; though they confessed that next

to the Duke the lawyer had their preference.  Necessarily the blonde now

went into a decline.  The parents were alarmed.  They pleaded with her to

marry the Duke, but she steadfastly refused, and pined on.  Then they

laid a plan.  They told her to wait a year and a day, and if at the end

of that time she still felt that she could not marry the Duke, she might

marry the lawyer with their full consent.  The result was as they had

foreseen: gladness came again, and the flush of returning health.  Then

the parents took the next step in their scheme.  They had the family

physician recommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the

thorough restoration of the blonde's strength; and they invited the Duke

to be of the party.  They judged that the Duke's constant presence and

the lawyer's protracted absence would do the rest--for they did not

invite the lawyer.



So they set sail in a steamer for America--and the third day out, when

their sea-sickness called truce and permitted them to take their first

meal at the public table, behold there sat the lawyer!  The Duke and

party made the best of an awkward situation; the voyage progressed, and

the vessel neared America.



But, by and by, two hundred miles off New Bedford, the ship took fire;

she burned to the water's edge; of all her crew and passengers, only

thirty were saved.  They floated about the sea half an afternoon and all

night long.  Among them were our friends.  The lawyer, by superhuman

exertions, had saved the blonde and her parents, swimming back and forth

two hundred yards and bringing one each time--(the girl first).  The Duke

had saved himself.  In the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene

and sent their boats.  The weather was stormy and the embarkation was

attended with much confusion and excitement.  The lawyer did his duty

like a man; helped his exhausted and insensible blonde, her parents and

some others into a boat (the Duke helped himself in); then a child fell

overboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and

helped half a dozen people fish it out, under the stimulus of its

mother's screams.  Then he ran back--a few seconds too late--the blonde's

boat was under way.  So he had to take the other boat, and go to the

other ship.  The storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of

each other--drove them whither it would.



When it calmed, at the end of three days, the blonde's ship was seven

hundred miles north of Boston and the other about seven hundred south of

that port.  The blonde's captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the

North Atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port

without orders; such being nautical law.  The lawyer's captain was to

cruise in the North Pacific, and he could not go back or make a port

without orders.  All the lawyer's money and baggage were in the blonde's

boat and went to the blonde's ship--so his captain made him work his

passage as a common sailor.  When both ships had been cruising nearly a

year, the one was off the coast of Greenland and the other in Behring's

Strait.  The blonde had long ago been well-nigh persuaded that her lawyer

had been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached

the raft, and now, under the pleadings of her parents and the Duke she

was at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant, and

prepare for the hated marriage.



But she would not yield a day before the date set.  The weeks dragged on,

the time narrowed, orders were given to deck the ship for the wedding--a

wedding at sea among icebergs and walruses.  Five days more and all would

be over.  So the blonde reflected, with a sigh and a tear.  Oh where was

her true love--and why, why did he not come and save her?  At that moment

he was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in Behring's Strait, five

thousand miles away, by the way of the Arctic Ocean, or twenty thousand

by the way of the Horn--that was the reason.  He struck, but not with

perfect aim--his foot slipped and he fell in the whale's mouth and went

down his throat.  He was insensible five days.  Then he came to himself

and heard voices; daylight was streaming through a hole cut in the

whale's roof.  He climbed out and astonished the sailors who were

hoisting blubber up a ship's side.  He recognized the vessel, flew

aboard, surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed:



"Stop the proceedings--I'm here!  Come to my arms, my own!"



There were foot-notes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein the

author endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the

possibilities; he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from

Behring's Strait to the coast of Greenland, five thousand miles in five

days, through the Arctic Ocean, from Charles Reade's "Love Me Little Love

Me Long," and considered that that established the fact that the thing

could be done; and he instanced Jonah's adventure as proof that a man

could live in a whale's belly, and added that if a preacher could stand

it three days a lawyer could surely stand it five!



There was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now, and the

stranger was peremptorily discharged, and his manuscript flung at his

head.  But he had already delayed things so much that there was not time

for some one else to rewrite the chapter, and so the paper came out

without any novel in it.  It was but a feeble, struggling, stupid

journal, and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence;

at any rate, before the first side of the next issue went to press, the

Weekly Occidental died as peacefully as an infant.



An effort was made to resurrect it, with the proposed advantage of a

telling new title, and Mr. F. said that The Phenix would be just the name

for it, because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its dead

ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor; but some low-

priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the

Lazarus; and inasmuch as the people were not profound in Scriptural

matters but thought the resurrected Lazarus and the dilapidated mendicant

that begged in the rich man's gateway were one and the same person, the

name became the laughing stock of the town, and killed the paper for good

and all.



I was sorry enough, for I was very proud of being connected with a

literary paper--prouder than I have ever been of anything since, perhaps.

I had written some rhymes for it--poetry I considered it--and it was a

great grief to me that the production was on the "first side" of the

issue that was not completed, and hence did not see the light.  But time

brings its revenges--I can put it in here; it will answer in place of a

tear dropped to the memory of the lost Occidental.  The idea (not the

chief idea, but the vehicle that bears it) was probably suggested by the

old song called "The Raging Canal," but I cannot remember now.  I do

remember, though, that at that time I thought my doggerel was one of the

ablest poems of the age:





THE AGED PILOT MAN.



On the Erie Canal, it was,

All on a summer's day,

I sailed forth with my parents

Far away to Albany.



From out the clouds at noon that day

There came a dreadful storm,

That piled the billows high about,

And filled us with alarm.



A man came rushing from a house,

Saying, "Snub up your boat I pray,

[The customary canal technicality for "tie up."]

Snub up your boat, snub up, alas,

Snub up while yet you may."



Our captain cast one glance astern,

Then forward glanced he,

And said, "My wife and little ones

I never more shall see."



Said Dollinger the pilot man,

In noble words, but few,--

"Fear not, but lean on Dollinger,

And he will fetch you through."



The boat drove on, the frightened mules

Tore through the rain and wind,

And bravely still, in danger's post,

The whip-boy strode behind.



"Come 'board, come 'board," the captain cried,

"Nor tempt so wild a storm;"

But still the raging mules advanced,

And still the boy strode on.



Then said the captain to us all,

"Alas, 'tis plain to me,

The greater danger is not there,

But here upon the sea.



"So let us strive, while life remains,

To save all souls on board,

And then if die at last we must,

Let .  .  .  .  I cannot speak the word!"



Said Dollinger the pilot man,

Tow'ring above the crew,

"Fear not, but trust in Dollinger,

And he will fetch you through."



"Low bridge!  low bridge!" all heads went down,

The laboring bark sped on;

A mill we passed, we passed church,

Hamlets, and fields of corn;

And all the world came out to see,

And chased along the shore

Crying, "Alas, alas, the sheeted rain,

The wind, the tempest's roar!

Alas, the gallant ship and crew,

Can nothing help them more?"



And from our deck sad eyes looked out

Across the stormy scene:

The tossing wake of billows aft,

The bending forests green,

The chickens sheltered under carts

In lee of barn the cows,

The skurrying swine with straw in mouth,

The wild spray from our bows!



"She balances!

She wavers!

Now let her go about!

If she misses stays and broaches to,

We're all"--then with a shout,]

"Huray!  huray!

Avast!  belay!

Take in more sail!

Lord, what a gale!

Ho, boy, haul taut on the hind mule's tail!"

"Ho!  lighten ship!  ho!  man the pump!

Ho, hostler, heave the lead!"



"A quarter-three!--'tis shoaling fast!

Three feet large!--t-h-r-e-e feet!--

Three feet scant!" I cried in fright

"Oh, is there no retreat?"



Said Dollinger, the pilot man,

As on the vessel flew,

"Fear not, but trust in Dollinger,

And he will fetch you through."



A panic struck the bravest hearts,

The boldest cheek turned pale;

For plain to all, this shoaling said

A leak had burst the ditch's bed!

And, straight as bolt from crossbow sped,

Our ship swept on, with shoaling lead,

Before the fearful gale!



"Sever the tow-line!  Cripple the mules!"

Too late!  There comes a shock!

Another length, and the fated craft

Would have swum in the saving lock!



Then gathered together the shipwrecked crew

And took one last embrace,

While sorrowful tears from despairing eyes

Ran down each hopeless face;

And some did think of their little ones

Whom they never more might see,

And others of waiting wives at home,

And mothers that grieved would be.



But of all the children of misery there

On that poor sinking frame,

But one spake words of hope and faith,

And I worshipped as they came:

Said Dollinger the pilot man,--

(O brave heart, strong and true!)--

"Fear not, but trust in Dollinger,

For he will fetch you through."



Lo!  scarce the words have passed his lips

The dauntless prophet say'th,

When every soul about him seeth

A wonder crown his faith!



And count ye all, both great and small,

As numbered with the dead:

For mariner for forty year,

On Erie, boy and man,

I never yet saw such a storm,

Or one't with it began!"



So overboard a keg of nails

And anvils three we threw,

Likewise four bales of gunny-sacks,

Two hundred pounds of glue,

Two sacks of corn, four ditto wheat,

A box of books, a cow,

A violin, Lord Byron's works,

A rip-saw and a sow.



A curve!  a curve!  the dangers grow!

"Labbord!--stabbord!--s-t-e-a-d-y!--so!--

Hard-a-port, Dol!--hellum-a-lee!

Haw the head mule!--the aft one gee!

Luff!--bring her to the wind!"



For straight a farmer brought a plank,--

(Mysteriously inspired)--

And laying it unto the ship,

In silent awe retired.



Then every sufferer stood amazed

That pilot man before;

A moment stood.  Then wondering turned,

And speechless walked ashore.









CHAPTER LII.



Since I desire, in this chapter, to say an instructive word or two about

the silver mines, the reader may take this fair warning and skip, if he

chooses.  The year 1863 was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination

of the "flush times."  Virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that

degree that the place looked like a very hive--that is when one's vision

could pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally

blowing in summer.  I will say, concerning this dust, that if you drove

ten miles through it, you and your horses would be coated with it a

sixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a

uniform pale yellow color, and your buggy would have three inches of dust

in it, thrown there by the wheels.  The delicate scales used by the

assayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be air-tight, and yet

some of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would

get in, somehow, and impair the accuracy of those scales.



Speculation ran riot, and yet there was a world of substantial business

going on, too.  All freights were brought over the mountains from

California (150 miles) by pack-train partly, and partly in huge wagons

drawn by such long mule teams that each team amounted to a procession,

and it did seem, sometimes, that the grand combined procession of animals

stretched unbroken from Virginia to California.  Its long route was

traceable clear across the deserts of the Territory by the writhing

serpent of dust it lifted up.  By these wagons, freights over that

hundred and fifty miles were $200 a ton for small lots (same price for

all express matter brought by stage), and $100 a ton for full loads.

One Virginia firm received one hundred tons of freight a month, and paid

$10,000 a month freightage.  In the winter the freights were much higher.

All the bullion was shipped in bars by stage to San Francisco (a bar was

usually about twice the size of a pig of lead and contained from $1,500

to $3,000 according to the amount of gold mixed with the silver), and the

freight on it (when the shipment was large) was one and a quarter per

cent. of its intrinsic value.



So, the freight on these bars probably averaged something more than $25

each.  Small shippers paid two per cent.  There were three stages a day,

each way, and I have seen the out-going stages carry away a third of a

ton of bullion each, and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot

and take it off.  However, these were extraordinary events.

[Mr. Valentine, Wells Fargo's agent, has handled all the bullion shipped

through the Virginia office for many a month.  To his memory--which is

excellent--we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company's

business in the Virginia office since the first of January, 1862: From

January 1st to April 1st, about $270,000 worth of bullion passed through

that office, during the next quarter, $570,000; next quarter, $800,000;

next quarter, $956,000; next quarter, $1,275,000; and for the quarter

ending on the 30th of last June, about $1,600,000.  Thus in a year and a

half, the Virginia office only shipped $5,330,000 in bullion.  During the

year 1862 they shipped $2,615,000, so we perceive the average shipments

have more than doubled in the last six months.  This gives us room to

promise for the Virginia office $500,000 a month for the year 1863

(though perhaps, judging by the steady increase in the business, we are

under estimating, somewhat).  This gives us $6,000,000 for the year.

Gold Hill and Silver City together can beat us--we will give them

$10,000,000.  To Dayton, Empire City, Ophir and Carson City, we will

allow an aggregate of $8,000,000, which is not over the mark, perhaps,

and may possibly be a little under it.  To Esmeralda we give $4,000,000.

To Reese River and Humboldt $2,000,000, which is liberal now, but may not

be before the year is out.  So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion

this year will be about $30,000,000.  Placing the number of mills in the

Territory at one hundred, this gives to each the labor of producing

$300,000 in bullion during the twelve months.  Allowing them to run three

hundred days in the year (which none of them more than do), this makes

their work average $1,000 a day.  Say the mills average twenty tons of

rock a day and this rock worth $50 as a general thing, and you have the

actual work of our one hundred mills figured down "to a spot"--$1,000 a

day each, and $30,000,000 a year in the aggregate.--Enterprise.

[A considerable over estimate--M.  T.]]



Two tons of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forty bars,

and the freight on it over $1,000.  Each coach always carried a deal of

ordinary express matter beside, and also from fifteen to twenty

passengers at from $25 to $30 a head.  With six stages going all the

time, Wells, Fargo and Co.'s Virginia City business was important and

lucrative.



All along under the centre of Virginia and Gold Hill, for a couple of

miles, ran the great Comstock silver lode--a vein of ore from fifty to

eighty feet thick between its solid walls of rock--a vein as wide as some

of New York's streets.  I will remind the reader that in Pennsylvania a

coal vein only eight feet wide is considered ample.



Virginia was a busy city of streets and houses above ground.  Under it

was another busy city, down in the bowels of the earth, where a great

population of men thronged in and out among an intricate maze of tunnels

and drifts, flitting hither and thither under a winking sparkle of

lights, and over their heads towered a vast web of interlocking timbers

that held the walls of the gutted Comstock apart.  These timbers were as

large as a man's body, and the framework stretched upward so far that no

eye could pierce to its top through the closing gloom.  It was like

peering up through the clean-picked ribs and bones of some colossal

skeleton.  Imagine such a framework two miles long, sixty feet wide, and

higher than any church spire in America.  Imagine this stately lattice-

work stretching down Broadway, from the St. Nicholas to Wall street, and

a Fourth of July procession, reduced to pigmies, parading on top of it

and flaunting their flags, high above the pinnacle of Trinity steeple.

One can imagine that, but he cannot well imagine what that forest of

timbers cost, from the time they were felled in the pineries beyond

Washoe Lake, hauled up and around Mount Davidson at atrocious rates of

freightage, then squared, let down into the deep maw of the mine and

built up there.  Twenty ample fortunes would not timber one of the

greatest of those silver mines.  The Spanish proverb says it requires a

gold mine to "run" a silver one, and it is true.  A beggar with a silver

mine is a pitiable pauper indeed if he cannot sell.



I spoke of the underground Virginia as a city.  The Gould and Curry is

only one single mine under there, among a great many others; yet the

Gould and Curry's streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in

extent, altogether, and its population five hundred miners.  Taken as a

whole, the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a

population of five or six thousand.  In this present day some of those

populations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under

Virginia and Gold Hill, and the signal-bells that tell them what the

superintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as

we strike a fire alarm.  Sometimes men fall down a shaft, there, a

thousand feet deep.  In such cases, the usual plan is to hold an inquest.



If you wish to visit one of those mines, you may walk through a tunnel

about half a mile long if you prefer it, or you may take the quicker plan

of shooting like a dart down a shaft, on a small platform.  It is like

tumbling down through an empty steeple, feet first.  When you reach the

bottom, you take a candle and tramp through drifts and tunnels where

throngs of men are digging and blasting; you watch them send up tubs full

of great lumps of stone--silver ore; you select choice specimens from the

mass, as souvenirs; you admire the world of skeleton timbering; you

reflect frequently that you are buried under a mountain, a thousand feet

below daylight; being in the bottom of the mine you climb from "gallery"

to "gallery," up endless ladders that stand straight up and down; when

your legs fail you at last, you lie down in a small box-car in a cramped

"incline" like a half-up-ended sewer and are dragged up to daylight

feeling as if you are crawling through a coffin that has no end to it.

Arrived at the top, you find a busy crowd of men receiving the ascending

cars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long rows of

bins capable of holding half a dozen tons each; under the bins are rows

of wagons loading from chutes and trap-doors in the bins, and down the

long street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the silver

mills with their rich freight.  It is all "done," now, and there you are.

You need never go down again, for you have seen it all.  If you have

forgotten the process of reducing the ore in the mill and making the

silver bars, you can go back and find it again in my Esmeralda chapters

if so disposed.



Of course these mines cave in, in places, occasionally, and then it is

worth one's while to take the risk of descending into them and observing

the crushing power exerted by the pressing weight of a settling mountain.

I published such an experience in the Enterprise, once, and from it I

will take an extract:



      AN HOUR IN THE CAVED MINES.--We journeyed down into the Ophir mine,

      yesterday, to see the earthquake.  We could not go down the deep

      incline, because it still has a propensity to cave in places.

      Therefore we traveled through the long tunnel which enters the hill

      above the Ophir office, and then by means of a series of long

      ladders, climbed away down from the first to the fourth gallery.

      Traversing a drift, we came to the Spanish line, passed five sets of

      timbers still uninjured, and found the earthquake.  Here was as

      complete a chaos as ever was seen--vast masses of earth and

      splintered and broken timbers piled confusedly together, with

      scarcely an aperture left large enough for a cat to creep through.

      Rubbish was still falling at intervals from above, and one timber

      which had braced others earlier in the day, was now crushed down out

      of its former position, showing that the caving and settling of the

      tremendous mass was still going on.  We were in that portion of the

      Ophir known as the "north mines."  Returning to the surface, we

      entered a tunnel leading into the Central, for the purpose of

      getting into the main Ophir.  Descending a long incline in this

      tunnel, we traversed a drift or so, and then went down a deep shaft

      from whence we proceeded into the fifth gallery of the Ophir.  From

      a side-drift we crawled through a small hole and got into the midst

      of the earthquake again--earth and broken timbers mingled together

      without regard to grace or symmetry.  A large portion of the second,

      third and fourth galleries had caved in and gone to destruction--the

      two latter at seven o'clock on the previous evening.



      At the turn-table, near the northern extremity of the fifth gallery,

      two big piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth

      gallery, and from the looks of the timbers, more was about to come.

      These beams are solid--eighteen inches square; first, a great beam

      is laid on the floor, then upright ones, five feet high, stand on

      it, supporting another horizontal beam, and so on, square above

      square, like the framework of a window.  The superincumbent weight

      was sufficient to mash the ends of those great upright beams fairly

      into the solid wood of the horizontal ones three inches, compressing

      and bending the upright beam till it curved like a bow.  Before the

      Spanish caved in, some of their twelve-inch horizontal timbers were

      compressed in this way until they were only five inches thick!

      Imagine the power it must take to squeeze a solid log together in

      that way.  Here, also, was a range of timbers, for a distance of

      twenty feet, tilted six inches out of the perpendicular by the

      weight resting upon them from the caved galleries above.  You could

      hear things cracking and giving way, and it was not pleasant to know

      that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking down upon

      you.  The men down in the mine do not mind it, however.



      Returning along the fifth gallery, we struck the safe part of the

      Ophir incline, and went down it to the sixth; but we found ten

      inches of water there, and had to come back.  In repairing the

      damage done to the incline, the pump had to be stopped for two

      hours, and in the meantime the water gained about a foot.  However,

      the pump was at work again, and the flood-water was decreasing.

      We climbed up to the fifth gallery again and sought a deep shaft,

      whereby we might descend to another part of the sixth, out of reach

      of the water, but suffered disappointment, as the men had gone to

      dinner, and there was no one to man the windlass.  So, having seen

      the earthquake, we climbed out at the Union incline and tunnel, and

      adjourned, all dripping with candle grease and perspiration, to

      lunch at the Ophir office.



      During the great flush year of 1863, Nevada [claims to have]

      produced $25,000,000 in bullion--almost, if not quite, a round

      million to each thousand inhabitants, which is very well,

      considering that she was without agriculture and manufactures.

      Silver mining was her sole productive industry. [Since the above was

      in type, I learn from an official source that the above figure is

      too high, and that the yield for 1863 did not exceed $20,000,000.]

      However, the day for large figures is approaching; the Sutro Tunnel

      is to plow through the Comstock lode from end to end, at a depth of

      two thousand feet, and then mining will be easy and comparatively

      inexpensive; and the momentous matters of drainage, and hoisting and

      hauling of ore will cease to be burdensome.  This vast work will

      absorb many years, and millions of dollars, in its completion; but

      it will early yield money, for that desirable epoch will begin as

      soon as it strikes the first end of the vein.  The tunnel will be

      some eight miles long, and will develop astonishing riches.  Cars

      will carry the ore through the tunnel and dump it in the mills and

      thus do away with the present costly system of double handling and

      transportation by mule teams.  The water from the tunnel will

      furnish the motive power for the mills.  Mr. Sutro, the originator

      of this prodigious enterprise, is one of the few men in the world

      who is gifted with the pluck and perseverance necessary to follow up

      and hound such an undertaking to its completion.  He has converted

      several obstinate Congresses to a deserved friendliness toward his

      important work, and has gone up and down and to and fro in Europe

      until he has enlisted a great moneyed interest in it there.









CHAPTER LIII.



Every now and then, in these days, the boys used to tell me I ought to

get one Jim Blaine to tell me the stirring story of his grandfather's old

ram--but they always added that I must not mention the matter unless Jim

was drunk at the time--just comfortably and sociably drunk.  They kept

this up until my curiosity was on the rack to hear the story.  I got to

haunting Blaine; but it was of no use, the boys always found fault with

his condition; he was often moderately but never satisfactorily drunk.

I never watched a man's condition with such absorbing interest, such

anxious solicitude; I never so pined to see a man uncompromisingly drunk

before.  At last, one evening I hurried to his cabin, for I learned that

this time his situation was such that even the most fastidious could find

no fault with it--he was tranquilly, serenely, symmetrically drunk--not a

hiccup to mar his voice, not a cloud upon his brain thick enough to

obscure his memory.  As I entered, he was sitting upon an empty powder-

keg, with a clay pipe in one hand and the other raised to command

silence.  His face was round, red, and very serious; his throat was bare

and his hair tumbled; in general appearance and costume he was a stalwart

miner of the period.  On the pine table stood a candle, and its dim light

revealed "the boys" sitting here and there on bunks, candle-boxes,

powder-kegs, etc.  They said:



"Sh--!  Don't speak--he's going to commence."





                THE STORY OF THE OLD RAM.



I found a seat at once, and Blaine said:



'I don't reckon them times will ever come again.  There never was a more

bullier old ram than what he was.  Grandfather fetched him from Illinois

--got him of a man by the name of Yates--Bill Yates--maybe you might have

heard of him; his father was a deacon--Baptist--and he was a rustler,

too; a man had to get up ruther early to get the start of old Thankful

Yates; it was him that put the Greens up to jining teams with my

grandfather when he moved west.



'Seth Green was prob'ly the pick of the flock; he married a Wilkerson--

Sarah Wilkerson--good cretur, she was--one of the likeliest heifers that

was ever raised in old Stoddard, everybody said that knowed her.  She

could heft a bar'l of flour as easy as I can flirt a flapjack.  And spin?

Don't mention it!  Independent?  Humph!  When Sile Hawkins come a

browsing around her, she let him know that for all his tin he couldn't

trot in harness alongside of her.  You see, Sile Hawkins was--no, it

warn't Sile Hawkins, after all--it was a galoot by the name of Filkins--

I disremember his first name; but he was a stump--come into pra'r meeting

drunk, one night, hooraying for Nixon, becuz he thought it was a primary;

and old deacon Ferguson up and scooted him through the window and he lit

on old Miss Jefferson's head, poor old filly.  She was a good soul--had a

glass eye and used to lend it to old Miss Wagner, that hadn't any, to

receive company in; it warn't big enough, and when Miss Wagner warn't

noticing, it would get twisted around in the socket, and look up, maybe,

or out to one side, and every which way, while t' other one was looking

as straight ahead as a spy-glass.



'Grown people didn't mind it, but it most always made the children cry, it

was so sort of scary.  She tried packing it in raw cotton, but it

wouldn't work, somehow--the cotton would get loose and stick out and look

so kind of awful that the children couldn't stand it no way.  She was

always dropping it out, and turning up her old dead-light on the company

empty, and making them oncomfortable, becuz she never could tell when it

hopped out, being blind on that side, you see.  So somebody would have to

hunch her and say, "Your game eye has fetched loose.  Miss Wagner dear"--

and then all of them would have to sit and wait till she jammed it in

again--wrong side before, as a general thing, and green as a bird's egg,

being a bashful cretur and easy sot back before company.  But being wrong

side before warn't much difference, anyway; becuz her own eye was sky-

blue and the glass one was yaller on the front side, so whichever way she

turned it it didn't match nohow.



'Old Miss Wagner was considerable on the borrow, she was.  When she had a

quilting, or Dorcas S'iety at her house she gen'ally borrowed Miss

Higgins's wooden leg to stump around on; it was considerable shorter than

her other pin, but much she minded that.  She said she couldn't abide

crutches when she had company, becuz they were so slow; said when she had

company and things had to be done, she wanted to get up and hump herself.

She was as bald as a jug, and so she used to borrow Miss Jacops's wig--

Miss Jacops was the coffin-peddler's wife--a ratty old buzzard, he was,

that used to go roosting around where people was sick, waiting for 'em;

and there that old rip would sit all day, in the shade, on a coffin that

he judged would fit the can'idate; and if it was a slow customer and kind

of uncertain, he'd fetch his rations and a blanket along and sleep in the

coffin nights.  He was anchored out that way, in frosty weather, for

about three weeks, once, before old Robbins's place, waiting for him; and

after that, for as much as two years, Jacops was not on speaking terms

with the old man, on account of his disapp'inting him.  He got one of his

feet froze, and lost money, too, becuz old Robbins took a favorable turn

and got well.  The next time Robbins got sick, Jacops tried to make up

with him, and varnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along; but

old Robbins was too many for him; he had him in, and 'peared to be

powerful weak; he bought the coffin for ten dollars and Jacops was to pay

it back and twenty-five more besides if Robbins didn't like the coffin

after he'd tried it.  And then Robbins died, and at the funeral he

bursted off the lid and riz up in his shroud and told the parson to let

up on the performances, becuz he could not stand such a coffin as that.

You see he had been in a trance once before, when he was young, and he

took the chances on another, cal'lating that if he made the trip it was

money in his pocket, and if he missed fire he couldn't lose a cent.  And

by George he sued Jacops for the rhino and got jedgment; and he set up

the coffin in his back parlor and said he 'lowed to take his time, now.

It was always an aggravation to Jacops, the way that miserable old thing

acted.  He moved back to Indiany pretty soon--went to Wellsville--

Wellsville was the place the Hogadorns was from.  Mighty fine family.

Old Maryland stock.  Old Squire Hogadorn could carry around more mixed

licker, and cuss better than most any man I ever see.  His second wife

was the widder Billings--she that was Becky Martin; her dam was deacon

Dunlap's first wife.  Her oldest child, Maria, married a missionary and

died in grace--et up by the savages.  They et him, too, poor feller--

biled him.  It warn't the custom, so they say, but they explained to

friends of his'n that went down there to bring away his things, that

they'd tried missionaries every other way and never could get any good

out of 'em--and so it annoyed all his relations to find out that that

man's life was fooled away just out of a dern'd experiment, so to speak.

But mind you, there ain't anything ever reely lost; everything that

people can't understand and don't see the reason of does good if you only

hold on and give it a fair shake; Prov'dence don't fire no blank

ca'tridges, boys.  That there missionary's substance, unbeknowns to

himself, actu'ly converted every last one of them heathens that took a

chance at the barbacue.  Nothing ever fetched them but that.  Don't tell

me it was an accident that he was biled.  There ain't no such a thing as

an accident.



'When my uncle Lem was leaning up agin a scaffolding once, sick, or drunk,

or suthin, an Irishman with a hod full of bricks fell on him out of the

third story and broke the old man's back in two places.  People said it

was an accident.  Much accident there was about that.  He didn't know

what he was there for, but he was there for a good object.  If he hadn't

been there the Irishman would have been killed.  Nobody can ever make me

believe anything different from that.  Uncle Lem's dog was there.  Why

didn't the Irishman fall on the dog?  Becuz the dog would a seen him a

coming and stood from under.  That's the reason the dog warn't appinted.

A dog can't be depended on to carry out a special providence.  Mark my

words it was a put-up thing.  Accidents don't happen, boys.  Uncle Lem's

dog--I wish you could a seen that dog.  He was a reglar shepherd--or

ruther he was part bull and part shepherd--splendid animal; belonged to

parson Hagar before Uncle Lem got him.  Parson Hagar belonged to the

Western Reserve Hagars; prime family; his mother was a Watson; one of his

sisters married a Wheeler; they settled in Morgan county, and he got

nipped by the machinery in a carpet factory and went through in less than

a quarter of a minute; his widder bought the piece of carpet that had his

remains wove in, and people come a hundred mile to 'tend the funeral.

There was fourteen yards in the piece.



'She wouldn't let them roll him up, but planted him just so--full length.

The church was middling small where they preached the funeral, and they

had to let one end of the coffin stick out of the window.  They didn't

bury him--they planted one end, and let him stand up, same as a monument.

And they nailed a sign on it and put--put on--put on it --sacred to--the

m-e-m-o-r-y--of fourteen y-a-r-d-s--of three-ply--car---pet--containing

all that was--m-o-r-t-a-l--of--of--W-i-l-l-i-a-m--W-h-e--"'



Jim Blaine had been growing gradually drowsy and drowsier--his head

nodded, once, twice, three times--dropped peacefully upon his breast, and

he fell tranquilly asleep.  The tears were running down the boys' cheeks

--they were suffocating with suppressed laughter--and had been from the

start, though I had never noticed it.  I perceived that I was "sold."

I learned then that Jim Blaine's peculiarity was that whenever he reached

a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep him from

setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure

which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram--and the mention of

the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever heard him

get, concerning it.  He always maundered off, interminably, from one

thing to another, till his whisky got the best of him and he fell asleep.

What the thing was that happened to him and his grandfather's old ram is

a dark mystery to this day, for nobody has ever yet found out.









CHAPTER LIV.



Of course there was a large Chinese population in Virginia--it is the

case with every town and city on the Pacific coast.  They are a harmless

race when white men either let them alone or treat them no worse than

dogs; in fact they are almost entirely harmless anyhow, for they seldom

think of resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries.  They are

quiet, peaceable, tractable, free from drunkenness, and they are as

industrious as the day is long.  A disorderly Chinaman is rare, and a

lazy one does not exist.  So long as a Chinaman has strength to use his

hands he needs no support from anybody; white men often complain of want

of work, but a Chinaman offers no such complaint; he always manages to

find something to do.  He is a great convenience to everybody--even to

the worst class of white men, for he bears the most of their sins,

suffering fines for their petty thefts, imprisonment for their robberies,

and death for their murders.  Any white man can swear a Chinaman's life

away in the courts, but no Chinaman can testify against a white man.

Ours is the "land of the free"--nobody denies that--nobody challenges it.

[Maybe it is because we won't let other people testify.] As I write, news

comes that in broad daylight in San Francisco, some boys have stoned an

inoffensive Chinaman to death, and that although a large crowd witnessed

the shameful deed, no one interfered.



There are seventy thousand (and possibly one hundred thousand) Chinamen

on the Pacific coast.  There were about a thousand in Virginia.  They

were penned into a "Chinese quarter"--a thing which they do not

particularly object to, as they are fond of herding together.  Their

buildings were of wood; usually only one story high, and set thickly

together along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through.

Their quarter was a little removed from the rest of the town.  The chief

employment of Chinamen in towns is to wash clothing.  They always send a

bill, like this below, pinned to the clothes.  It is mere ceremony, for

it does not enlighten the customer much.  Their price for washing was

$2.50 per dozen--rather cheaper than white people could afford to wash

for at that time.  A very common sign on the Chinese houses was: "See

Yup, Washer and Ironer"; "Hong Wo, Washer"; "Sam Sing & Ah Hop, Washing."

The house servants, cooks, etc., in California and Nevada, were chiefly

Chinamen.  There were few white servants and no Chinawomen so employed.

Chinamen make good house servants, being quick, obedient, patient, quick

to learn and tirelessly industrious.  They do not need to be taught a

thing twice, as a general thing.  They are imitative.  If a Chinaman were

to see his master break up a centre table, in a passion, and kindle a

fire with it, that Chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture

for fuel forever afterward.



All Chinamen can read, write and cipher with easy facility--pity but all

our petted voters could.  In California they rent little patches of

ground and do a deal of gardening.  They will raise surprising crops of

vegetables on a sand pile.  They waste nothing.  What is rubbish to a

Christian, a Chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or

another.  He gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white

people throw away, and procures marketable tin and solder from them by

melting.  He gathers up old bones and turns them into manure.

In California he gets a living out of old mining claims that white men

have abandoned as exhausted and worthless--and then the officers come

down on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the

legislature has given the broad, general name of "foreign" mining tax,

but it is usually inflicted on no foreigners but Chinamen.  This swindle

has in some cases been repeated once or twice on the same victim in the

course of the same month--but the public treasury was no additionally

enriched by it, probably.



Chinamen hold their dead in great reverence--they worship their departed

ancestors, in fact.  Hence, in China, a man's front yard, back yard, or

any other part of his premises, is made his family burying ground, in

order that he may visit the graves at any and all times.  Therefore that

huge empire is one mighty cemetery; it is ridged and wringled from its

centre to its circumference with graves--and inasmuch as every foot of

ground must be made to do its utmost, in China, lest the swarming

population suffer for food, the very graves are cultivated and yield a

harvest, custom holding this to be no dishonor to the dead.  Since the

departed are held in such worshipful reverence, a Chinaman cannot bear

that any indignity be offered the places where they sleep.

Mr. Burlingame said that herein lay China's bitter opposition to

railroads; a road could not be built anywhere in the empire without

disturbing the graves of their ancestors or friends.



A Chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except his body

lay in his beloved China; also, he desires to receive, himself, after

death, that worship with which he has honored his dead that preceded him.

Therefore, if he visits a foreign country, he makes arrangements to have

his bones returned to China in case he dies; if he hires to go to a

foreign country on a labor contract, there is always a stipulation that

his body shall be taken back to China if he dies; if the government sells

a gang of Coolies to a foreigner for the usual five-year term, it is

specified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored to China in

case of death.  On the Pacific coast the Chinamen all belong to one or

another of several great companies or organizations, and these companies

keep track of their members, register their names, and ship their bodies

home when they die.  The See Yup Company is held to be the largest of

these.  The Ning Yeong Company is next, and numbers eighteen thousand

members on the coast.  Its headquarters are at San Francisco, where it

has a costly temple, several great officers (one of whom keeps regal

state in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity), and a

numerous priesthood.  In it I was shown a register of its members, with

the dead and the date of their shipment to China duly marked.  Every ship

that sails from San Francisco carries away a heavy freight of Chinese

corpses--or did, at least, until the legislature, with an ingenious

refinement of Christian cruelty, forbade the shipments, as a neat

underhanded way of deterring Chinese immigration.  The bill was offered,

whether it passed or not.  It is my impression that it passed.  There was

another bill--it became a law--compelling every incoming Chinaman to be

vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly appointed quack (no decent doctor

would defile himself with such legalized robbery) ten dollars for it.

As few importers of Chinese would want to go to an expense like that, the

law-makers thought this would be another heavy blow to Chinese

immigration.



What the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like--or, indeed, what the

Chinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is like--may be

gathered from this item which I printed in the Enterprise while reporting

for that paper:



      CHINATOWN.--Accompanied by a fellow reporter, we made a trip through

      our Chinese quarter the other night.  The Chinese have built their

      portion of the city to suit themselves; and as they keep neither

      carriages nor wagons, their streets are not wide enough, as a

      general thing, to admit of the passage of vehicles.  At ten o'clock

      at night the Chinaman may be seen in all his glory.  In every little

      cooped-up, dingy cavern of a hut, faint with the odor of burning

      Josh-lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly,

      guttering tallow candle, were two or three yellow, long-tailed

      vagabonds, coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed, smoking opium,

      motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess

      of satisfaction--or rather the recent smoker looks thus, immediately

      after having passed the pipe to his neighbor--for opium-smoking is a

      comfortless operation, and requires constant attention.  A lamp sits

      on the bed, the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker's

      mouth; he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire, sets it on

      fire, and plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a

      hole with putty; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds

      to smoke--and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of

      the juices in the stem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a statue.

      John likes it, though; it soothes him, he takes about two dozen

      whiffs, and then rolls over to dream, Heaven only knows what, for we

      could not imagine by looking at the soggy creature.  Possibly in his

      visions he travels far away from the gross world and his regular

      washing, and feast on succulent rats and birds'-nests in Paradise.



Mr. Ah Sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at No.  13 Wang

street.  He lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest

way.  He had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies,

with unpronouncable names, imported from China in little crockery jugs,

and which he offered to us in dainty little miniature wash-basins of

porcelain.  He offered us a mess of birds'-nests; also, small, neat

sausages, of which we could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen

to try, but we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse,

and therefore refrained.  Mr. Sing had in his store a thousand articles

of merchandise, curious to behold, impossible to imagine the uses of, and

beyond our ability to describe.



His ducks, however, and his eggs, we could understand; the former were

split open and flattened out like codfish, and came from China in that

shape, and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which

kept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage.



We found Mr. Hong Wo, No. 37 Chow-chow street, making up a lottery

scheme--in fact we found a dozen others occupied in the same way in

various parts of the quarter, for about every third Chinaman runs a

lottery, and the balance of the tribe "buck" at it.  "Tom," who speaks

faultless English, and used to be chief and only cook to the Territorial

Enterprise, when the establishment kept bachelor's hall two years ago,

said that "Sometime Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap, ketch um two tree

hundred, sometime no ketch um anything; lottery like one man fight um

seventy--may-be he whip, may-be he get whip heself, welly good."



However, the percentage being sixty-nine against him, the chances are,

as a general thing, that "he get whip heself."  We could not see that

these lotteries differed in any respect from our own, save that the

figures being Chinese, no ignorant white man might ever hope to succeed

in telling "t'other from which;" the manner of drawing is similar to

ours.



Mr. See Yup keeps a fancy store on Live Fox street.  He sold us fans of

white feathers, gorgeously ornamented; perfumery that smelled like

Limburger cheese, Chinese pens, and watch-charms made of a stone

unscratchable with steel instruments, yet polished and tinted like the

inner coat of a sea-shell.  As tokens of his esteem, See Yup presented

the party with gaudy plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with

peacocks' feathers.



We ate chow-chow with chop-sticks in the celestial restaurants; our

comrade chided the moon-eyed damsels in front of the houses for their

want of feminine reserve; we received protecting Josh-lights from our

hosts and "dickered" for a pagan God or two.  Finally, we were impressed

with the genius of a Chinese book-keeper; he figured up his accounts on a

machine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars; the different

rows represented units, tens, hundreds and thousands.  He fingered them

with incredible rapidity--in fact, he pushed them from place to place as

fast as a musical professor's fingers travel over the keys of a piano.



They are a kindly disposed, well-meaning race, and are respected and well

treated by the upper classes, all over the Pacific coast.  No Californian

gentleman or lady ever abuses or oppresses a Chinaman, under any

circumstances, an explanation that seems to be much needed in the East.

Only the scum of the population do it--they and their children; they,

and, naturally and consistently, the policemen and politicians, likewise,

for these are the dust-licking pimps and slaves of the scum, there as

well as elsewhere in America.









CHAPTER LV.



I began to get tired of staying in one place so long.



There was no longer satisfying variety in going down to Carson to report

the proceedings of the legislature once a year, and horse-races and

pumpkin-shows once in three months; (they had got to raising pumpkins and

potatoes in Washoe Valley, and of course one of the first achievements of

the legislature was to institute a ten-thousand-dollar Agricultural Fair

to show off forty dollars' worth of those pumpkins in--however, the

territorial legislature was usually spoken of as the "asylum").  I wanted

to see San Francisco.  I wanted to go somewhere.  I wanted--I did not

know what I wanted.  I had the "spring fever" and wanted a change,

principally, no doubt.  Besides, a convention had framed a State

Constitution; nine men out of every ten wanted an office; I believed that

these gentlemen would "treat" the moneyless and the irresponsible among

the population into adopting the constitution and thus well-nigh killing

the country (it could not well carry such a load as a State government,

since it had nothing to tax that could stand a tax, for undeveloped mines

could not, and there were not fifty developed ones in the land, there was

but little realty to tax, and it did seem as if nobody was ever going to

think of the simple salvation of inflicting a money penalty on murder).

I believed that a State government would destroy the "flush times," and I

wanted to get away.  I believed that the mining stocks I had on hand

would soon be worth $100,000, and thought if they reached that before the

Constitution was adopted, I would sell out and make myself secure from

the crash the change of government was going to bring.  I considered

$100,000 sufficient to go home with decently, though it was but a small

amount compared to what I had been expecting to return with.  I felt

rather down-hearted about it, but I tried to comfort myself with the

reflection that with such a sum I could not fall into want.  About this

time a schoolmate of mine whom I had not seen since boyhood, came

tramping in on foot from Reese River, a very allegory of Poverty.

The son of wealthy parents, here he was, in a strange land, hungry,

bootless, mantled in an ancient horse-blanket, roofed with a brimless

hat, and so generally and so extravagantly dilapidated that he could have

"taken the shine out of the Prodigal Son himself," as he pleasantly

remarked.



He wanted to borrow forty-six dollars--twenty-six to take him to San

Francisco, and twenty for something else; to buy some soap with, maybe,

for he needed it.  I found I had but little more than the amount wanted,

in my pocket; so I stepped in and borrowed forty-six dollars of a banker

(on twenty days' time, without the formality of a note), and gave it him,

rather than walk half a block to the office, where I had some specie laid

up.  If anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back

that forty-six dollars to the banker (for I did not expect it of the

Prodigal, and was not disappointed), I would have felt injured.  And so

would the banker.



I wanted a change.  I wanted variety of some kind.  It came.  Mr. Goodman

went away for a week and left me the post of chief editor.  It destroyed

me.  The first day, I wrote my "leader" in the forenoon.  The second day,

I had no subject and put it off till the afternoon.  The third day I put

it off till evening, and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the

"American Cyclopedia," that steadfast friend of the editor, all over this

land.  The fourth day I "fooled around" till midnight, and then fell back

on the Cyclopedia again.  The fifth day I cudgeled my brain till

midnight, and then kept the press waiting while I penned some bitter

personalities on six different people.  The sixth day I labored in

anguish till far into the night and brought forth--nothing.  The paper

went to press without an editorial.  The seventh day I resigned.  On the

eighth, Mr. Goodman returned and found six duels on his hands--my

personalities had borne fruit.



Nobody, except he has tried it, knows what it is to be an editor.  It is

easy to scribble local rubbish, with the facts all before you; it is easy

to clip selections from other papers; it is easy to string out a

correspondence from any locality; but it is unspeakable hardship to write

editorials.  Subjects are the trouble--the dreary lack of them, I mean.

Every day, it is drag, drag, drag--think, and worry and suffer--all the

world is a dull blank, and yet the editorial columns must be filled.

Only give the editor a subject, and his work is done--it is no trouble to

write it up; but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains

dry every day in the week, fifty-two weeks in the year.  It makes one low

spirited simply to think of it.  The matter that each editor of a daily

paper in America writes in the course of a year would fill from four to

eight bulky volumes like this book!  Fancy what a library an editor's

work would make, after twenty or thirty years' service.  Yet people often

marvel that Dickens, Scott, Bulwer, Dumas, etc., have been able to

produce so many books.  If these authors had wrought as voluminously as

newspaper editors do, the result would be something to marvel at, indeed.

How editors can continue this tremendous labor, this exhausting

consumption of brain fibre (for their work is creative, and not a mere

mechanical laying-up of facts, like reporting), day after day and year

after year, is incomprehensible.  Preachers take two months' holiday in

midsummer, for they find that to produce two sermons a week is wearing,

in the long run.  In truth it must be so, and is so; and therefore, how

an editor can take from ten to twenty texts and build upon them from ten

to twenty painstaking editorials a week and keep it up all the year

round, is farther beyond comprehension than ever.  Ever since I survived

my week as editor, I have found at least one pleasure in any newspaper

that comes to my hand; it is in admiring the long columns of editorial,

and wondering to myself how in the mischief he did it!



Mr. Goodman's return relieved me of employment, unless I chose to become

a reporter again.  I could not do that; I could not serve in the ranks

after being General of the army.  So I thought I would depart and go

abroad into the world somewhere.  Just at this juncture, Dan, my

associate in the reportorial department, told me, casually, that two

citizens had been trying to persuade him to go with them to New York and

aid in selling a rich silver mine which they had discovered and secured

in a new mining district in our neighborhood.  He said they offered to

pay his expenses and give him one third of the proceeds of the sale.

He had refused to go.  It was the very opportunity I wanted.  I abused

him for keeping so quiet about it, and not mentioning it sooner.  He said

it had not occurred to him that I would like to go, and so he had

recommended them to apply to Marshall, the reporter of the other paper.

I asked Dan if it was a good, honest mine, and no swindle.  He said the

men had shown him nine tons of the rock, which they had got out to take

to New York, and he could cheerfully say that he had seen but little rock

in Nevada that was richer; and moreover, he said that they had secured a

tract of valuable timber and a mill-site, near the mine.  My first idea

was to kill Dan.  But I changed my mind, notwithstanding I was so angry,

for I thought maybe the chance was not yet lost.  Dan said it was by no

means lost; that the men were absent at the mine again, and would not be

in Virginia to leave for the East for some ten days; that they had

requested him to do the talking to Marshall, and he had promised that he

would either secure Marshall or somebody else for them by the time they

got back; he would now say nothing to anybody till they returned, and

then fulfil his promise by furnishing me to them.



It was splendid.  I went to bed all on fire with excitement; for nobody

had yet gone East to sell a Nevada silver mine, and the field was white

for the sickle.  I felt that such a mine as the one described by Dan

would bring a princely sum in New York, and sell without delay or

difficulty.  I could not sleep, my fancy so rioted through its castles in

the air.  It was the "blind lead" come again.



Next day I got away, on the coach, with the usual eclat attending

departures of old citizens,--for if you have only half a dozen friends

out there they will make noise for a hundred rather than let you seem to

go away neglected and unregretted--and Dan promised to keep strict watch

for the men that had the mine to sell.



The trip was signalized but by one little incident, and that occurred

just as we were about to start.  A very seedy looking vagabond passenger

got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver

bricks was thrown in.  He was standing on the pavement, when an awkward

express employee, carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds, stumbled

and let it fall on the bummer's foot.  He instantly dropped on the ground

and began to howl in the most heart-breaking way.  A sympathizing crowd

gathered around and were going to pull his boot off; but he screamed

louder than ever and they desisted; then he fell to gasping, and between

the gasps ejaculated "Brandy!  for Heaven's sake, brandy!"  They poured

half a pint down him, and it wonderfully restored and comforted him.

Then he begged the people to assist him to the stage, which was done.

The express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense, but he

declined, and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along with

him, to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on, he would be

grateful and content.  He was quickly supplied with two bottles, and we

drove off.  He was so smiling and happy after that, that I could not

refrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a

crushed foot.



"Well," said he, "I hadn't had a drink for twelve hours, and hadn't a

cent to my name.  I was most perishing--and so, when that duffer dropped

that hundred-pounder on my foot, I see my chance.  Got a cork leg, you

know!" and he pulled up his pantaloons and proved it.



He was as drunk as a lord all day long, and full of chucklings over his

timely ingenuity.



One drunken man necessarily reminds one of another.  I once heard a

gentleman tell about an incident which he witnessed in a Californian bar-

room.  He entitled it "Ye Modest Man Taketh a Drink."  It was nothing but

a bit of acting, but it seemed to me a perfect rendering, and worthy of

Toodles himself.  The modest man, tolerably far gone with beer and other

matters, enters a saloon (twenty-five cents is the price for anything and

everything, and specie the only money used) and lays down a half dollar;

calls for whiskey and drinks it; the bar-keeper makes change and lays the

quarter in a wet place on the counter; the modest man fumbles at it with

nerveless fingers, but it slips and the water holds it; he contemplates

it, and tries again; same result; observes that people are interested in

what he is at, blushes; fumbles at the quarter again--blushes--puts his

forefinger carefully, slowly down, to make sure of his aim--pushes the

coin toward the bar-keeper, and says with a sigh:



"Gimme a cigar!"



Naturally, another gentleman present told about another drunken man.  He

said he reeled toward home late at night; made a mistake and entered the

wrong gate; thought he saw a dog on the stoop; and it was--an iron one.



He stopped and considered; wondered if it was a dangerous dog; ventured

to say "Be (hic) begone!"  No effect.  Then he approached warily, and

adopted conciliation; pursed up his lips and tried to whistle, but

failed; still approached, saying, "Poor dog!--doggy, doggy, doggy!--poor

doggy-dog!"  Got up on the stoop, still petting with fond names; till

master of the advantages; then exclaimed, "Leave, you thief!"--planted a

vindictive kick in his ribs, and went head-over-heels overboard, of

course.  A pause; a sigh or two of pain, and then a remark in a

reflective voice:



"Awful solid dog.  What could he ben eating?  ('ic!) Rocks, p'raps.

Such animals is dangerous.--'  At's what I say--they're dangerous.  If a

man--('ic!)--if a man wants to feed a dog on rocks, let him feed him on

rocks; 'at's all right; but let him keep him at home--not have him layin'

round promiscuous, where ('ic!) where people's liable to stumble over him

when they ain't noticin'!"



It was not without regret that I took a last look at the tiny flag (it

was thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide) fluttering like a lady's

handkerchief from the topmost peak of Mount Davidson, two thousand feet

above Virginia's roofs, and felt that doubtless I was bidding a permanent

farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous enjoyment of

life I had ever experienced.  And this reminds me of an incident which

the dullest memory Virginia could boast at the time it happened must

vividly recall, at times, till its possessor dies.  Late one summer

afternoon we had a rain shower.



That was astonishing enough, in itself, to set the whole town buzzing,

for it only rains (during a week or two weeks) in the winter in Nevada,

and even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for any

merchant to keep umbrellas for sale.  But the rain was not the chief

wonder.  It only lasted five or ten minutes; while the people were still

talking about it all the heavens gathered to themselves a dense blackness

as of midnight.  All the vast eastern front of Mount Davidson, over-

looking the city, put on such a funereal gloom that only the nearness and

solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly distinguishable

from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested against.  This

unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain; and as they

looked, a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving and

quivering in the heart of the midnight, away up on the extreme summit!

In a few minutes the streets were packed with people, gazing with hardly

an uttered word, at the one brilliant mote in the brooding world of

darkness.  It flicked like a candle-flame, and looked no larger; but with

such a background it was wonderfully bright, small as it was.  It was the

flag!--though no one suspected it at first, it seemed so like a

supernatural visitor of some kind--a mysterious messenger of good

tidings, some were fain to believe.  It was the nation's emblem

transfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled from

view; and on no other object did the glory fall, in all the broad

panorama of mountain ranges and deserts.  Not even upon the staff of the

flag--for that, a needle in the distance at any time, was now untouched

by the light and undistinguishable in the gloom.  For a whole hour the

weird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude, and still the

thousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest.  How the

people were wrought up!  The superstition grew apace that this was a

mystic courier come with great news from the war--the poetry of the idea

excusing and commending it--and on it spread, from heart to heart, from

lip to lip and from street to street, till there was a general impulse to

have out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of

artillery!



And all that time one sorely tried man, the telegraph operator sworn to

official secrecy, had to lock his lips and chain his tongue with a

silence that was like to rend them; for he, and he only, of all the

speculating multitude, knew the great things this sinking sun had seen

that day in the east--Vicksburg fallen, and the Union arms victorious at

Gettysburg!



But for the journalistic monopoly that forbade the slightest revealment

of eastern news till a day after its publication in the California

papers, the glorified flag on Mount Davidson would have been saluted and

re-saluted, that memorable evening, as long as there was a charge of

powder to thunder with; the city would have been illuminated, and every

man that had any respect for himself would have got drunk,--as was the

custom of the country on all occasions of public moment.  Even at this

distant day I cannot think of this needlessly marred supreme opportunity

without regret.  What a time we might have had!









CHAPTER LVI.



We rumbled over the plains and valleys, climbed the Sierras to the

clouds, and looked down upon summer-clad California.  And I will remark

here, in passing, that all scenery in California requires distance to

give it its highest charm.  The mountains are imposing in their sublimity

and their majesty of form and altitude, from any point of view--but one

must have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings;

a Californian forest is best at a little distance, for there is a sad

poverty of variety in species, the trees being chiefly of one monotonous

family--redwood, pine, spruce, fir--and so, at a near view there is a

wearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms, stretched down ward

and outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to "Sh!--

don't say a word!--you might disturb somebody!"  Close at hand, too,

there is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine; there

is a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining foliage; one

walks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spines of

the foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft of a footfall;

he tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for substantial,

shapely leaves; he looks for moss and grass to loll upon, and finds none,

for where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt, enemies to

pensive musing and clean apparel.  Often a grassy plain in California, is

what it should be, but often, too, it is best contemplated at a distance,

because although its grass blades are tall, they stand up vindictively

straight and self-sufficient, and are unsociably wide apart, with

uncomely spots of barren sand between.



One of the queerest things I know of, is to hear tourists from "the

States" go into ecstasies over the loveliness of "ever-blooming

California."  And they always do go into that sort of ecstasies.  But

perhaps they would modify them if they knew how old Californians, with

the memory full upon them of the dust-covered and questionable summer

greens of Californian "verdure," stand astonished, and filled with

worshipping admiration, in the presence of the lavish richness, the

brilliant green, the infinite freshness, the spend-thrift variety of form

and species and foliage that make an Eastern landscape a vision of

Paradise itself.  The idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and

sombre California, when that man has seen New England's meadow-expanses

and her maples, oaks and cathedral-windowed elms decked in summer attire,

or the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests, comes

very near being funny--would be, in fact, but that it is so pathetic.

No land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful.  The tropics are

not, for all the sentiment that is wasted on them.  They seem beautiful

at first, but sameness impairs the charm by and by.  Change is the

handmaiden Nature requires to do her miracles with.  The land that has

four well-defined seasons, cannot lack beauty, or pall with monotony.

Each season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the watching of

its unfolding, its gradual, harmonious development, its culminating

graces--and just as one begins to tire of it, it passes away and a

radical change comes, with new witcheries and new glories in its train.

And I think that to one in sympathy with nature, each season, in its

turn, seems the loveliest.



San Francisco, a truly fascinating city to live in, is stately and

handsome at a fair distance, but close at hand one notes that the

architecture is mostly old-fashioned, many streets are made up of

decaying, smoke-grimed, wooden houses, and the barren sand-hills toward

the outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently.  Even the kindly

climate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally

experienced, for a lovely, cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and by,

and then when the longed for rain does come it stays.  Even the playful

earthquake is better contemplated at a dis--



However there are varying opinions about that.



The climate of San Francisco is mild and singularly equable.  The

thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round.  It hardly

changes at all.  You sleep under one or two light blankets Summer and

Winter, and never use a mosquito bar.  Nobody ever wears Summer clothing.

You wear black broadcloth--if you have it--in August and January, just

the same.  It is no colder, and no warmer, in the one month than the

other.  You do not use overcoats and you do not use fans.  It is as

pleasant a climate as could well be contrived, take it all around, and is

doubtless the most unvarying in the whole world.  The wind blows there a

good deal in the summer months, but then you can go over to Oakland, if

you choose--three or four miles away--it does not blow there.  It has

only snowed twice in San Francisco in nineteen years, and then it only

remained on the ground long enough to astonish the children, and set them

to wondering what the feathery stuff was.



During eight months of the year, straight along, the skies are bright and

cloudless, and never a drop of rain falls.  But when the other four

months come along, you will need to go and steal an umbrella.  Because

you will require it.  Not just one day, but one hundred and twenty days

in hardly varying succession.  When you want to go visiting, or attend

church, or the theatre, you never look up at the clouds to see whether it

is likely to rain or not--you look at the almanac.  If it is Winter, it

will rain--and if it is Summer, it won't rain, and you cannot help it.

You never need a lightning-rod, because it never thunders and it never

lightens.  And after you have listened for six or eight weeks, every

night, to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains, you will wish in your

heart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsy skies

once, and make everything alive--you will wish the prisoned lightnings

would cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a blinding

glare for one little instant.  You would give anything to hear the old

familiar thunder again and see the lightning strike somebody.  And along

in the Summer, when you have suffered about four months of lustrous,

pitiless sunshine, you are ready to go down on your knees and plead for

rain--hail--snow--thunder and lightning--anything to break the monotony--

you will take an earthquake, if you cannot do any better.  And the

chances are that you'll get it, too.



San Francisco is built on sand hills, but they are prolific sand hills.

They yield a generous vegetation.  All the rare flowers which people in

"the States" rear with such patient care in parlor flower-pots and green-

houses, flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year round.

Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion flowers, moss roses--I do

not know the names of a tenth part of them.  I only know that while New

Yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow, Californians are

burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only keep their hands

off and let them grow.  And I have heard that they have also that rarest

and most curious of all the flowers, the beautiful Espiritu Santo, as the

Spaniards call it--or flower of the Holy Spirit--though I thought it grew

only in Central America--down on the Isthmus.  In its cup is the

daintiest little facsimile of a dove, as pure as snow.  The Spaniards

have a superstitious reverence for it.  The blossom has been conveyed to

the States, submerged in ether; and the bulb has been taken thither also,

but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived, has failed.



I have elsewhere spoken of the endless Winter of Mono, California, and

but this moment of the eternal Spring of San Francisco.  Now if we travel

a hundred miles in a straight line, we come to the eternal Summer of

Sacramento.  One never sees Summer-clothing or mosquitoes in San

Francisco--but they can be found in Sacramento.  Not always and

unvaryingly, but about one hundred and forty-three months out of twelve

years, perhaps.  Flowers bloom there, always, the reader can easily

believe--people suffer and sweat, and swear, morning, noon and night, and

wear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves.  It gets hot there,

but if you go down to Fort Yuma you will find it hotter.  Fort Yuma is

probably the hottest place on earth.  The thermometer stays at one

hundred and twenty in the shade there all the time--except when it varies

and goes higher.  It is a U.S. military post, and its occupants get so

used to the terrific heat that they suffer without it.  There is a

tradition (attributed to John Phenix [It has been purloined by fifty

different scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed

to steal one.--M.  T.]) that a very, very wicked soldier died there,

once, and of course, went straight to the hottest corner of perdition,--

and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets.  There is no doubt

about the truth of this statement--there can be no doubt about it.  I

have seen the place where that soldier used to board.  In Sacramento it

is fiery Summer always, and you can gather roses, and eat strawberries

and ice-cream, and wear white linen clothes, and pant and perspire, at

eight or nine o'clock in the morning, and then take the cars, and at noon

put on your furs and your skates, and go skimming over frozen Donner

Lake, seven thousand feet above the valley, among snow banks fifteen feet

deep, and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty

crags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea.



There is a transition for you!  Where will you find another like it in

the Western hemisphere?  And some of us have swept around snow-walled

curves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity, six thousand feet above

the sea, and looked down as the birds do, upon the deathless Summer of

the Sacramento Valley, with its fruitful fields, its feathery foliage,

its silver streams, all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted

atmosphere, and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance--a

dreamy, exquisite glimpse of fairyland, made all the more charming and

striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow,

and savage crags and precipices.









CHAPTER LVII.



It was in this Sacramento Valley, just referred to, that a deal of the

most lucrative of the early gold mining was done, and you may still see,

in places, its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered and disfigured

by the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago.  You may see

such disfigurements far and wide over California--and in some such

places, where only meadows and forests are visible--not a living

creature, not a house, no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin, and not a

sound, not even a whisper to disturb the Sabbath stillness--you will find

it hard to believe that there stood at one time a fiercely-flourishing

little city, of two thousand or three thousand souls, with its newspaper,

fire company, brass band, volunteer militia, bank, hotels, noisy Fourth

of July processions and speeches, gambling hells crammed with tobacco

smoke, profanity, and rough-bearded men of all nations and colors, with

tables heaped with gold dust sufficient for the revenues of a German

principality--streets crowded and rife with business--town lots worth

four hundred dollars a front foot--labor, laughter, music, dancing,

swearing, fighting, shooting, stabbing--a bloody inquest and a man for

breakfast every morning--everything that delights and adorns existence--

all the appointments and appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and

promising young city,--and now nothing is left of it all but a lifeless,

homeless solitude.  The men are gone, the houses have vanished, even the

name of the place is forgotten.  In no other land, in modern times, have

towns so absolutely died and disappeared, as in the old mining regions of

California.



It was a driving, vigorous, restless population in those days.  It was a

curious population.  It was the only population of the kind that the

world has ever seen gathered together, and it is not likely that the

world will ever see its like again.  For observe, it was an assemblage of

two hundred thousand young men--not simpering, dainty, kid-gloved

weaklings, but stalwart, muscular, dauntless young braves, brimful of

push and energy, and royally endowed with every attribute that goes to

make up a peerless and magnificent manhood--the very pick and choice of

the world's glorious ones.  No women, no children, no gray and stooping

veterans,--none but erect, bright-eyed, quick-moving, strong-handed young

giants--the strangest population, the finest population, the most gallant

host that ever trooped down the startled solitudes of an unpeopled land.

And where are they now?  Scattered to the ends of the earth--or

prematurely aged and decrepit--or shot or stabbed in street affrays--or

dead of disappointed hopes and broken hearts--all gone, or nearly all--

victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calf--the noblest holocaust

that ever wafted its sacrificial incense heavenward.  It is pitiful to

think upon.



It was a splendid population--for all the slow, sleepy, sluggish-brained

sloths staid at home--you never find that sort of people among pioneers--

you cannot build pioneers out of that sort of material.  It was that

population that gave to California a name for getting up astounding

enterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent dash and daring

and a recklessness of cost or consequences, which she bears unto this

day--and when she projects a new surprise, the grave world smiles as

usual, and says "Well, that is California all over."



But they were rough in those times!  They fairly reveled in gold, whisky,

fights, and fandangoes, and were unspeakably happy.  The honest miner

raked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day, and

what with the gambling dens and the other entertainments, he hadn't a

cent the next morning, if he had any sort of luck.  They cooked their own

bacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed their own shirts--

blue woollen ones; and if a man wanted a fight on his hands without any

annoying delay, all he had to do was to appear in public in a white shirt

or a stove-pipe hat, and he would be accommodated.  For those people

hated aristocrats.  They had a particular and malignant animosity toward

what they called a "biled shirt."



It was a wild, free, disorderly, grotesque society!  Men--only swarming

hosts of stalwart men--nothing juvenile, nothing feminine, visible

anywhere!



In those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that

rare and blessed spectacle, a woman!  Old inhabitants tell how, in a

certain camp, the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was

come!  They had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the

camping-ground--sign of emigrants from over the great plains.  Everybody

went down there, and a shout went up when an actual, bona fide dress was

discovered fluttering in the wind!  The male emigrant was visible.  The

miners said:



"Fetch her out!"



He said: "It is my wife, gentlemen--she is sick--we have been robbed of

money, provisions, everything, by the Indians--we want to rest."



"Fetch her out!  We've got to see her!"



"But, gentlemen, the poor thing, she--"



"FETCH HER OUT!"



He "fetched her out," and they swung their hats and sent up three rousing

cheers and a tiger; and they crowded around and gazed at her, and touched

her dress, and listened to her voice with the look of men who listened to

a memory rather than a present reality--and then they collected twenty-

five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man, and swung their hats

again and gave three more cheers, and went home satisfied.





Once I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer, and talked

with his daughter, a young lady whose first experience in San Francisco

was an adventure, though she herself did not remember it, as she was only

two or three years old at the time.  Her father said that, after landing

from the ship, they were walking up the street, a servant leading the

party with the little girl in her arms.  And presently a huge miner,

bearded, belted, spurred, and bristling with deadly weapons--just down

from a long campaign in the mountains, evidently-barred the way, stopped

the servant, and stood gazing, with a face all alive with gratification

and astonishment.  Then he said, reverently:



"Well, if it ain't a child!" And then he snatched a little leather sack

out of his pocket and said to the servant:



"There's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and I'll give it to

you to let me kiss the child!"



That anecdote is true.



But see how things change.  Sitting at that dinner-table, listening to

that anecdote, if I had offered double the money for the privilege of

kissing the same child, I would have been refused.  Seventeen added years

have far more than doubled the price.



And while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star City, in the

Humboldt Mountains, I took my place in a sort of long, post-office single

file of miners, to patiently await my chance to peep through a crack in

the cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensation--a genuine, live

Woman!  And at the end of half of an hour my turn came, and I put my eye

to the crack, and there she was, with one arm akimbo, and tossing flap-

jacks in a frying-pan with the other.



And she was one hundred and sixty-five [Being in calmer mood, now, I

voluntarily knock off a hundred from that.--M.T.] years old, and hadn't a

tooth in her head.









CHAPTER LVIII.



For a few months I enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of

existence--a butterfly idleness; nothing to do, nobody to be responsible

to, and untroubled with financial uneasiness.  I fell in love with the

most cordial and sociable city in the Union.  After the sage-brush and

alkali deserts of Washoe, San Francisco was Paradise to me.  I lived at

the best hotel, exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places,

infested the opera, and learned to seem enraptured with music which

oftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it, if I had had the

vulgar honesty to confess it.  However, I suppose I was not greatly worse

than the most of my countrymen in that.  I had longed to be a butterfly,

and I was one at last.  I attended private parties in sumptuous evening

dress, simpered and aired my graces like a born beau, and polkad and

schottisched with a step peculiar to myself--and the kangaroo.  In a

word, I kept the due state of a man worth a hundred thousand dollars

(prospectively,) and likely to reach absolute affluence when that silver-

mine sale should be ultimately achieved in the East.  I spent money with

a free hand, and meantime watched the stock sales with an interested eye

and looked to see what might happen in Nevada.



Something very important happened.  The property holders of Nevada voted

against the State Constitution; but the folks who had nothing to lose

were in the majority, and carried the measure over their heads.  But

after all it did not immediately look like a disaster, though

unquestionably it was one I hesitated, calculated the chances, and then

concluded not to sell.  Stocks went on rising; speculation went mad;

bankers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, mechanics, laborers, even the very

washerwomen and servant girls, were putting up their earnings on silver

stocks, and every sun that rose in the morning went down on paupers

enriched and rich men beggared.  What a gambling carnival it was!  Gould

and Curry soared to six thousand three hundred dollars a foot!  And then

--all of a sudden, out went the bottom and everything and everybody went

to ruin and destruction!  The wreck was complete.



The bubble scarcely left a microscopic moisture behind it.  I was an

early beggar and a thorough one.  My hoarded stocks were not worth the

paper they were printed on.  I threw them all away.  I, the cheerful

idiot that had been squandering money like water, and thought myself

beyond the reach of misfortune, had not now as much as fifty dollars when

I gathered together my various debts and paid them.  I removed from the

hotel to a very private boarding house.  I took a reporter's berth and

went to work.  I was not entirely broken in spirit, for I was building

confidently on the sale of the silver mine in the east.  But I could not

hear from Dan.  My letters miscarried or were not answered.



One day I did not feel vigorous and remained away from the office.  The

next day I went down toward noon as usual, and found a note on my desk

which had been there twenty-four hours.  It was signed "Marshall"--the

Virginia reporter--and contained a request that I should call at the

hotel and see him and a friend or two that night, as they would sail for

the east in the morning.  A postscript added that their errand was a big

mining speculation!  I was hardly ever so sick in my life.  I abused

myself for leaving Virginia and entrusting to another man a matter I

ought to have attended to myself; I abused myself for remaining away from

the office on the one day of all the year that I should have been there.

And thus berating myself I trotted a mile to the steamer wharf and

arrived just in time to be too late.  The ship was in the stream and

under way.



I comforted myself with the thought that may be the speculation would

amount to nothing--poor comfort at best--and then went back to my

slavery, resolved to put up with my thirty-five dollars a week and forget

all about it.



A month afterward I enjoyed my first earthquake.  It was one which was

long called the "great" earthquake, and is doubtless so distinguished

till this day.  It was just after noon, on a bright October day.  I was

coming down Third street.  The only objects in motion anywhere in sight

in that thickly built and populous quarter, were a man in a buggy behind

me, and a street car wending slowly up the cross street.  Otherwise, all

was solitude and a Sabbath stillness.  As I turned the corner, around a

frame house, there was a great rattle and jar, and it occurred to me that

here was an item!--no doubt a fight in that house.  Before I could turn

and seek the door, there came a really terrific shock; the ground seemed

to roll under me in waves, interrupted by a violent joggling up and down,

and there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses rubbing together.

I fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow.  I knew what it was,

now, and from mere reportorial instinct, nothing else, took out my watch

and noted the time of day; at that moment a third and still severer shock

came, and as I reeled about on the pavement trying to keep my footing,

I saw a sight!  The entire front of a tall four-story brick building in

Third street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawling across the

street, raising a dust like a great volume of smoke!  And here came the

buggy--overboard went the man, and in less time than I can tell it the

vehicle was distributed in small fragments along three hundred yards of

street.



One could have fancied that somebody had fired a charge of chair-rounds

and rags down the thoroughfare.  The street car had stopped, the horses

were rearing and plunging, the passengers were pouring out at both ends,

and one fat man had crashed half way through a glass window on one side

of the car, got wedged fast and was squirming and screaming like an

impaled madman.  Every door, of every house, as far as the eye could

reach, was vomiting a stream of human beings; and almost before one could

execute a wink and begin another, there was a massed multitude of people

stretching in endless procession down every street my position commanded.

Never was solemn solitude turned into teeming life quicker.



Of the wonders wrought by "the great earthquake," these were all that

came under my eye; but the tricks it did, elsewhere, and far and wide

over the town, made toothsome gossip for nine days.



The destruction of property was trifling--the injury to it was wide-

spread and somewhat serious.



The "curiosities" of the earthquake were simply endless.  Gentlemen and

ladies who were sick, or were taking a siesta, or had dissipated till a

late hour and were making up lost sleep, thronged into the public streets

in all sorts of queer apparel, and some without any at all.  One woman

who had been washing a naked child, ran down the street holding it by the

ankles as if it were a dressed turkey.  Prominent citizens who were

supposed to keep the Sabbath strictly, rushed out of saloons in their

shirt-sleeves, with billiard cues in their hands.  Dozens of men with

necks swathed in napkins, rushed from barber-shops, lathered to the eyes

or with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy

stubble.  Horses broke from stables, and a frightened dog rushed up a

short attic ladder and out on to a roof, and when his scare was over had

not the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up.



A prominent editor flew down stairs, in the principal hotel, with nothing

on but one brief undergarment--met a chambermaid, and exclaimed:



"Oh, what shall I do!  Where shall I go!"



She responded with naive serenity:



"If you have no choice, you might try a clothing-store!"



A certain foreign consul's lady was the acknowledged leader of fashion,

and every time she appeared in anything new or extraordinary, the ladies

in the vicinity made a raid on their husbands' purses and arrayed

themselves similarly.  One man who had suffered considerably and growled

accordingly, was standing at the window when the shocks came, and the

next instant the consul's wife, just out of the bath, fled by with no

other apology for clothing than--a bath-towel!  The sufferer rose

superior to the terrors of the earthquake, and said to his wife:



"Now that is something like!  Get out your towel my dear!"



The plastering that fell from ceilings in San Francisco that day, would

have covered several acres of ground.  For some days afterward, groups of

eyeing and pointing men stood about many a building, looking at long zig-

zag cracks that extended from the eaves to the ground.  Four feet of the

tops of three chimneys on one house were broken square off and turned

around in such a way as to completely stop the draft.



A crack a hundred feet long gaped open six inches wide in the middle of

one street and then shut together again with such force, as to ridge up

the meeting earth like a slender grave.  A lady sitting in her rocking

and quaking parlor, saw the wall part at the ceiling, open and shut

twice, like a mouth, and then-drop the end of a brick on the floor like a

tooth.  She was a woman easily disgusted with foolishness, and she arose

and went out of there.  One lady who was coming down stairs was

astonished to see a bronze Hercules lean forward on its pedestal as if to

strike her with its club.  They both reached the bottom of the flight at

the same time,--the woman insensible from the fright.  Her child, born

some little time afterward, was club-footed.  However--on second

thought,--if the reader sees any coincidence in this, he must do it at

his own risk.



The first shock brought down two or three huge organ-pipes in one of the

churches.  The minister, with uplifted hands, was just closing the

services.  He glanced up, hesitated, and said:



"However, we will omit the benediction!"--and the next instant there was

a vacancy in the atmosphere where he had stood.



After the first shock, an Oakland minister said:



"Keep your seats!  There is no better place to die than this"--



And added, after the third:



"But outside is good enough!"  He then skipped out at the back door.



Such another destruction of mantel ornaments and toilet bottles as the

earthquake created, San Francisco never saw before.  There was hardly a

girl or a matron in the city but suffered losses of this kind.  Suspended

pictures were thrown down, but oftener still, by a curious freak of the

earthquake's humor, they were whirled completely around with their faces

to the wall!  There was great difference of opinion, at first, as to the

course or direction the earthquake traveled, but water that splashed out

of various tanks and buckets settled that.  Thousands of people were made

so sea-sick by the rolling and pitching of floors and streets that they

were weak and bed-ridden for hours, and some few for even days

afterward.--Hardly an individual escaped nausea entirely.



The queer earthquake--episodes that formed the staple of San Francisco

gossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this, and so

I will diverge from the subject.



By and by, in the due course of things, I picked up a copy of the

Enterprise one day, and fell under this cruel blow:



      NEVADA MINES IN NEW YORK.--G.  M.  Marshall, Sheba Hurs and Amos H.

      Rose, who left San Francisco last July for New York City, with ores

      from mines in Pine Wood District, Humboldt County, and on the Reese

      River range, have disposed of a mine containing six thousand feet

      and called the Pine Mountains Consolidated, for the sum of

      $3,000,000.  The stamps on the deed, which is now on its way to

      Humboldt County, from New York, for record, amounted to $3,000,

      which is said to be the largest amount of stamps ever placed on one

      document.  A working capital of $1,000,000 has been paid into the

      treasury, and machinery has already been purchased for a large

      quartz mill, which will be put up as soon as possible.  The stock in

      this company is all full paid and entirely unassessable.  The ores

      of the mines in this district somewhat resemble those of the Sheba

      mine in Humboldt.  Sheba Hurst, the discoverer of the mines, with

      his friends corralled all the best leads and all the land and timber

      they desired before making public their whereabouts.  Ores from

      there, assayed in this city, showed them to be exceedingly rich in

      silver and gold--silver predominating.  There is an abundance of

      wood and water in the District.  We are glad to know that New York

      capital has been enlisted in the development of the mines of this

      region.  Having seen the ores and assays, we are satisfied that the

      mines of the District are very valuable--anything but wild-cat.



Once more native imbecility had carried the day, and I had lost a

million!  It was the "blind lead" over again.



Let us not dwell on this miserable matter.  If I were inventing these

things, I could be wonderfully humorous over them; but they are too true

to be talked of with hearty levity, even at this distant day. [True, and

yet not exactly as given in the above figures, possibly.  I saw Marshall,

months afterward, and although he had plenty of money he did not claim to

have captured an entire million.  In fact I gathered that he had not then

received $50,000.  Beyond that figure his fortune appeared to consist of

uncertain vast expectations rather than prodigious certainties.  However,

when the above item appeared in print I put full faith in it, and

incontinently wilted and went to seed under it.] Suffice it that I so

lost heart, and so yielded myself up to repinings and sighings and

foolish regrets, that I neglected my duties and became about worthless,

as a reporter for a brisk newspaper.  And at last one of the proprietors

took me aside, with a charity I still remember with considerable respect,

and gave me an opportunity to resign my berth and so save myself the

disgrace of a dismissal.









CHAPTER LIX.



For a time I wrote literary screeds for the Golden Era. C. H. Webb had

established a very excellent literary weekly called the Californian, but

high merit was no guaranty of success; it languished, and he sold out to

three printers, and Bret Harte became editor at $20 a week, and I was

employed to contribute an article a week at $12.  But the journal still

languished, and the printers sold out to Captain Ogden, a rich man and a

pleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive

luxury without much caring about the cost of it.  When he grew tired of

the novelty, he re-sold to the printers, the paper presently died a

peaceful death, and I was out of work again.  I would not mention these

things but for the fact that they so aptly illustrate the ups and downs

that characterize life on the Pacific coast.  A man could hardly stumble

into such a variety of queer vicissitudes in any other country.



For two months my sole occupation was avoiding acquaintances; for during

that time I did not earn a penny, or buy an article of any kind, or pay

my board.  I became a very adept at "slinking."  I slunk from back street

to back street, I slunk away from approaching faces that looked familiar,

I slunk to my meals, ate them humbly and with a mute apology for every

mouthful I robbed my generous landlady of, and at midnight, after

wanderings that were but slinkings away from cheerfulness and light, I

slunk to my bed.  I felt meaner, and lowlier and more despicable than the

worms.  During all this time I had but one piece of money--a silver ten

cent piece--and I held to it and would not spend it on any account, lest

the consciousness coming strong upon me that I was entirely penniless,

might suggest suicide.  I had pawned every thing but the clothes I had

on; so I clung to my dime desperately, till it was smooth with handling.



However, I am forgetting.  I did have one other occupation beside that of

"slinking."  It was the entertaining of a collector (and being

entertained by him,) who had in his hands the Virginia banker's bill for

forty-six dollars which I had loaned my schoolmate, the "Prodigal."  This

man used to call regularly once a week and dun me, and sometimes oftener.

He did it from sheer force of habit, for he knew he could get nothing.

He would get out his bill, calculate the interest for me, at five per

cent a month, and show me clearly that there was no attempt at fraud in

it and no mistakes; and then plead, and argue and dun with all his might

for any sum--any little trifle--even a dollar--even half a dollar, on

account.  Then his duty was accomplished and his conscience free.  He

immediately dropped the subject there always; got out a couple of cigars

and divided, put his feet in the window, and then we would have a long,

luxurious talk about everything and everybody, and he would furnish me a

world of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store in his memory.

By and by he would clap his hat on his head, shake hands and say briskly:



"Well, business is business--can't stay with you always!"--and was off in

a second.



The idea of pining for a dun!  And yet I used to long for him to come,

and would get as uneasy as any mother if the day went by without his

visit, when I was expecting him.  But he never collected that bill, at

last nor any part of it.  I lived to pay it to the banker myself.



Misery loves company.  Now and then at night, in out-of-the way, dimly

lighted places, I found myself happening on another child of misfortune.

He looked so seedy and forlorn, so homeless and friendless and forsaken,

that I yearned toward him as a brother.  I wanted to claim kinship with

him and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together.  The drawing toward

each other must have been mutual; at any rate we got to falling together

oftener, though still seemingly by accident; and although we did not

speak or evince any recognition, I think the dull anxiety passed out of

both of us when we saw each other, and then for several hours we would

idle along contentedly, wide apart, and glancing furtively in at home

lights and fireside gatherings, out of the night shadows, and very much

enjoying our dumb companionship.



Finally we spoke, and were inseparable after that.  For our woes were

identical, almost.  He had been a reporter too, and lost his berth, and

this was his experience, as nearly as I can recollect it.  After losing

his berth he had gone down, down, down, with never a halt: from a

boarding house on Russian Hill to a boarding house in Kearney street;

from thence to Dupont; from thence to a low sailor den; and from thence

to lodgings in goods boxes and empty hogsheads near the wharves.  Then;

for a while, he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of

grain on the piers; when that failed he had found food here and there as

chance threw it in his way.  He had ceased to show his face in daylight,

now, for a reporter knows everybody, rich and poor, high and low, and

cannot well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day.



This mendicant Blucher--I call him that for convenience--was a splendid

creature.  He was full of hope, pluck and philosophy; he was well read

and a man of cultivated taste; he had a bright wit and was a master of

satire; his kindliness and his generous spirit made him royal in my eyes

and changed his curb-stone seat to a throne and his damaged hat to a

crown.



He had an adventure, once, which sticks fast in my memory as the most

pleasantly grotesque that ever touched my sympathies.  He had been

without a penny for two months.  He had shirked about obscure streets,

among friendly dim lights, till the thing had become second nature to

him.  But at last he was driven abroad in daylight.  The cause was

sufficient; he had not tasted food for forty-eight hours, and he could

not endure the misery of his hunger in idle hiding.  He came along a back

street, glowering at the loaves in bake-shop windows, and feeling that he

could trade his life away for a morsel to eat.  The sight of the bread

doubled his hunger; but it was good to look at it, any how, and imagine

what one might do if one only had it.



Presently, in the middle of the street he saw a shining spot--looked

again--did not, and could not, believe his eyes--turned away, to try

them, then looked again.  It was a verity--no vain, hunger-inspired

delusion--it was a silver dime!



He snatched it--gloated over it; doubted it--bit it--found it genuine--

choked his heart down, and smothered a halleluiah.  Then he looked

around--saw that nobody was looking at him--threw the dime down where it

was before--walked away a few steps, and approached again, pretending he

did not know it was there, so that he could re-enjoy the luxury of

finding it.  He walked around it, viewing it from different points; then

sauntered about with his hands in his pockets, looking up at the signs

and now and then glancing at it and feeling the old thrill again.

Finally he took it up, and went away, fondling it in his pocket.  He

idled through unfrequented streets, stopping in doorways and corners to

take it out and look at it.  By and by he went home to his lodgings--an

empty queens-ware hogshead,--and employed himself till night trying to

make up his mind what to buy with it.  But it was hard to do.  To get the

most for it was the idea.  He knew that at the Miner's Restaurant he

could get a plate of beans and a piece of bread for ten cents; or a fish-

ball and some few trifles, but they gave "no bread with one fish-ball"

there.  At French Pete's he could get a veal cutlet, plain, and some

radishes and bread, for ten cents; or a cup of coffee--a pint at least--

and a slice of bread; but the slice was not thick enough by the eighth of

an inch, and sometimes they were still more criminal than that in the

cutting of it.  At seven o'clock his hunger was wolfish; and still his

mind was not made up.  He turned out and went up Merchant street, still

ciphering; and chewing a bit of stick, as is the way of starving men.



He passed before the lights of Martin's restaurant, the most aristocratic

in the city, and stopped.  It was a place where he had often dined, in

better days, and Martin knew him well.  Standing aside, just out of the

range of the light, he worshiped the quails and steaks in the show

window, and imagined that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and

some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him to go in

there and take whatever he wanted.  He chewed his stick with a hungry

interest as he warmed to his subject.  Just at this juncture he was

conscious of some one at his side, sure enough; and then a finger touched

his arm.  He looked up, over his shoulder, and saw an apparition--a very

allegory of Hunger!  It was a man six feet high, gaunt, unshaven, hung

with rags; with a haggard face and sunken cheeks, and eyes that pleaded

piteously.  This phantom said:



"Come with me--please."



He locked his arm in Blucher's and walked up the street to where the

passengers were few and the light not strong, and then facing about, put

out his hands in a beseeching way, and said:



"Friend--stranger--look at me!  Life is easy to you--you go about, placid

and content, as I did once, in my day--you have been in there, and eaten

your sumptuous supper, and picked your teeth, and hummed your tune, and

thought your pleasant thoughts, and said to yourself it is a good world--

but you've never suffered!  You don't know what trouble is--you don't

know what misery is--nor hunger!  Look at me!  Stranger have pity on a

poor friendless, homeless dog!  As God is my judge, I have not tasted

food for eight and forty hours!--look in my eyes and see if I lie!  Give

me the least trifle in the world to keep me from starving--anything--

twenty-five cents!  Do it, stranger--do it, please.  It will be nothing

to you, but life to me.  Do it, and I will go down on my knees and lick

the dust before you!  I will kiss your footprints--I will worship the

very ground you walk on!  Only twenty-five cents!  I am famishing--

perishing--starving by inches!  For God's sake don't desert me!"



Blucher was bewildered--and touched, too--stirred to the depths.  He

reflected.  Thought again.  Then an idea struck him, and he said:



"Come with me."



He took the outcast's arm, walked him down to Martin's restaurant, seated

him at a marble table, placed the bill of fare before him, and said:



"Order what you want, friend.  Charge it to me, Mr. Martin."



"All right, Mr. Blucher," said Martin.



Then Blucher stepped back and leaned against the counter and watched the

man stow away cargo after cargo of buckwheat cakes at seventy-five cents

a plate; cup after cup of coffee, and porter house steaks worth two

dollars apiece; and when six dollars and a half's worth of destruction

had been accomplished, and the stranger's hunger appeased, Blucher went

down to French Pete's, bought a veal cutlet plain, a slice of bread, and

three radishes, with his dime, and set to and feasted like a king!



Take the episode all around, it was as odd as any that can be culled from

the myriad curiosities of Californian life, perhaps.









CHAPTER LX.



By and by, an old friend of mine, a miner, came down from one of the

decayed mining camps of Tuolumne, California, and I went back with him.

We lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside, and there were not five

other cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest.  Yet a

flourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this

grassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years

before, and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teeming

hive, the centre of the city.  When the mines gave out the town fell into

decay, and in a few years wholly disappeared--streets, dwellings, shops,

everything--and left no sign.  The grassy slopes were as green and smooth

and desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed.  The mere

handful of miners still remaining, had seen the town spring up spread,

grow and flourish in its pride; and they had seen it sicken and die, and

pass away like a dream.  With it their hopes had died, and their zest of

life.  They had long ago resigned themselves to their exile, and ceased

to correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes toward

their early homes.  They had accepted banishment, forgotten the world and

been forgotten of the world.  They were far from telegraphs and

railroads, and they stood, as it were, in a living grave, dead to the

events that stirred the globe's great populations, dead to the common

interests of men, isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind.

It was the most singular, and almost the most touching and melancholy

exile that fancy can imagine.--One of my associates in this locality, for

two or three months, was a man who had had a university education; but

now for eighteen years he had decayed there by inches, a bearded, rough-

clad, clay-stained miner, and at times, among his sighings and

soliloquizings, he unconsciously interjected vaguely remembered Latin and

Greek sentences--dead and musty tongues, meet vehicles for the thoughts

of one whose dreams were all of the past, whose life was a failure; a

tired man, burdened with the present, and indifferent to the future; a

man without ties, hopes, interests, waiting for rest and the end.



In that one little corner of California is found a species of mining

which is seldom or never mentioned in print.  It is called "pocket

mining" and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little

corner.  The gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt, as

in ordinary placer mines, but is collected in little spots, and they are

very wide apart and exceedingly hard to find, but when you do find one

you reap a rich and sudden harvest.  There are not now more than twenty

pocket miners in that entire little region.  I think I know every one of

them personally.  I have known one of them to hunt patiently about the

hill-sides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to make

a snuff-box--his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the time--and

then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in two dips of

his shovel.  I have known him to take out three thousand dollars in two

hours, and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness, then enter on a

dazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure before the night

was gone.  And the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual,

and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills hunting

pockets again happy and content.  This is the most fascinating of all the

different kinds of mining, and furnishes a very handsome percentage of

victims to the lunatic asylum.



Pocket hunting is an ingenious process.  You take a spadeful of earth

from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it

gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment.

Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the

heaviest, it has sought the bottom.  Among the sediment you will find

half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads.  You are

delighted.  You move off to one side and wash another pan.  If you find

gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan.  If you

find no gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are

on the right scent.



You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the

hill--for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich

deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been

washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they

wandered.  And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and

narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that

you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the

hill your lines have converged to a point--a single foot from that point

you cannot find any gold.  Your breath comes short and quick, you are

feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you

pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down,

they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic

interest--and all at once you strike it!  Up comes a spadeful of earth

and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of

gold.  Sometimes that one spadeful is all--$500.  Sometimes the nest

contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out.

The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men

exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a

party who never got $300 out of it afterward.



The hogs are good pocket hunters.  All the summer they root around the

bushes, and turn up a thousand little piles of dirt, and then the miners

long for the rains; for the rains beat upon these little piles and wash

them down and expose the gold, possibly right over a pocket.  Two pockets

were found in this way by the same man in one day.  One had $5,000 in it

and the other $8,000.  That man could appreciate it, for he hadn't had a

cent for about a year.



In Tuolumne lived two miners who used to go to the neighboring village in

the afternoon and return every night with household supplies.  Part of

the distance they traversed a trail, and nearly always sat down to rest

on a great boulder that lay beside the path.  In the course of thirteen

years they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth, sitting on it.  By and

by two vagrant Mexicans came along and occupied the seat.  They began to

amuse themselves by chipping off flakes from the boulder with a sledge-

hammer.  They examined one of these flakes and found it rich with gold.

That boulder paid them $800 afterward.  But the aggravating circumstance

was that these "Greasers" knew that there must be more gold where that

boulder came from, and so they went panning up the hill and found what

was probably the richest pocket that region has yet produced.  It took

three months to exhaust it, and it yielded $120,000.  The two American

miners who used to sit on the boulder are poor yet, and they take turn

about in getting up early in the morning to curse those Mexicans--and

when it comes down to pure ornamental cursing, the native American is

gifted above the sons of men.



I have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mining because it

is a subject that is seldom referred to in print, and therefore I judged

that it would have for the reader that interest which naturally attaches

to novelty.









CHAPTER LXI.



One of my comrades there--another of those victims of eighteen years of

unrequited toil and blighted hopes--was one of the gentlest spirits that

ever bore its patient cross in a weary exile: grave and simple Dick

Baker, pocket-miner of Dead-House Gulch.--He was forty-six, gray as a

rat, earnest, thoughtful, slenderly educated, slouchily dressed and clay-

soiled, but his heart was finer metal than any gold his shovel ever

brought to light--than any, indeed, that ever was mined or minted.



Whenever he was out of luck and a little down-hearted, he would fall to

mourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used to own (for where women

and children are not, men of kindly impulses take up with pets, for they

must love something).  And he always spoke of the strange sagacity of

that cat with the air of a man who believed in his secret heart that

there was something human about it--may be even supernatural.



I heard him talking about this animal once.  He said:



"Gentlemen, I used to have a cat here, by the name of Tom Quartz, which

you'd a took an interest in I reckon--most any body would.  I had him

here eight year--and he was the remarkablest cat I ever see.  He was a

large gray one of the Tom specie, an' he had more hard, natchral sense

than any man in this camp--'n' a power of dignity--he wouldn't let the

Gov'ner of Californy be familiar with him.  He never ketched a rat in his

life--'peared to be above it.  He never cared for nothing but mining.

He knowed more about mining, that cat did, than any man I ever, ever see.

You couldn't tell him noth'n 'bout placer diggin's--'n' as for pocket

mining, why he was just born for it.



"He would dig out after me an' Jim when we went over the hills

prospect'n', and he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile,

if we went so fur.  An' he had the best judgment about mining ground--why

you never see anything like it.  When we went to work, he'd scatter a

glance around, 'n' if he didn't think much of the indications, he would

give a look as much as to say, 'Well, I'll have to get you to excuse me,'

'n' without another word he'd hyste his nose into the air 'n' shove for

home.  But if the ground suited him, he would lay low 'n' keep dark till

the first pan was washed, 'n' then he would sidle up 'n' take a look, an'

if there was about six or seven grains of gold he was satisfied--he

didn't want no better prospect 'n' that--'n' then he would lay down on

our coats and snore like a steamboat till we'd struck the pocket, an'

then get up 'n' superintend.  He was nearly lightnin' on superintending.



"Well, bye an' bye, up comes this yer quartz excitement.  Every body was

into it--every body was pick'n' 'n' blast'n' instead of shovelin' dirt on

the hill side--every body was put'n' down a shaft instead of scrapin' the

surface.  Noth'n' would do Jim, but we must tackle the ledges, too, 'n'

so we did.  We commenced put'n' down a shaft, 'n' Tom Quartz he begin to

wonder what in the Dickens it was all about.  He hadn't ever seen any

mining like that before, 'n' he was all upset, as you may say--he

couldn't come to a right understanding of it no way--it was too many for

him.  He was down on it, too, you bet you--he was down on it powerful--

'n' always appeared to consider it the cussedest foolishness out.  But

that cat, you know, was always agin new fangled arrangements--somehow he

never could abide'em.  You know how it is with old habits.  But by an' by

Tom Quartz begin to git sort of reconciled a little, though he never

could altogether understand that eternal sinkin' of a shaft an' never

pannin' out any thing.  At last he got to comin' down in the shaft,

hisself, to try to cipher it out.  An' when he'd git the blues, 'n' feel

kind o'scruffy, 'n' aggravated 'n' disgusted--knowin' as he did, that the

bills was runnin' up all the time an' we warn't makin' a cent--he would

curl up on a gunny sack in the corner an' go to sleep.  Well, one day

when the shaft was down about eight foot, the rock got so hard that we

had to put in a blast--the first blast'n' we'd ever done since Tom Quartz

was born.  An' then we lit the fuse 'n' clumb out 'n' got off 'bout fifty

yards--'n' forgot 'n' left Tom Quartz sound asleep on the gunny sack.



"In 'bout a minute we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole, 'n'

then everything let go with an awful crash, 'n' about four million ton of

rocks 'n' dirt 'n' smoke 'n; splinters shot up 'bout a mile an' a half

into the air, an' by George, right in the dead centre of it was old Tom

Quartz a goin' end over end, an' a snortin' an' a sneez'n', an' a clawin'

an' a reachin' for things like all possessed.  But it warn't no use, you

know, it warn't no use.  An' that was the last we see of him for about

two minutes 'n' a half, an' then all of a sudden it begin to rain rocks

and rubbage, an' directly he come down ker-whop about ten foot off f'm

where we stood Well, I reckon he was p'raps the orneriest lookin' beast

you ever see.  One ear was sot back on his neck, 'n' his tail was stove

up, 'n' his eye-winkers was swinged off, 'n' he was all blacked up with

powder an' smoke, an' all sloppy with mud 'n' slush f'm one end to the

other.



"Well sir, it warn't no use to try to apologize--we couldn't say a word.

He took a sort of a disgusted look at hisself, 'n' then he looked at us--

an' it was just exactly the same as if he had said--'Gents, may be you

think it's smart to take advantage of a cat that 'ain't had no experience

of quartz minin', but I think different'--an' then he turned on his heel

'n' marched off home without ever saying another word.



"That was jest his style.  An' may be you won't believe it, but after

that you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz mining as what he was.

An' by an' bye when he did get to goin' down in the shaft agin, you'd 'a

been astonished at his sagacity.  The minute we'd tetch off a blast 'n'

the fuse'd begin to sizzle, he'd give a look as much as to say: 'Well,

I'll have to git you to excuse me,' an' it was surpris'n' the way he'd

shin out of that hole 'n' go f'r a tree.  Sagacity?  It ain't no name for

it.  'Twas inspiration!"



I said, "Well, Mr. Baker, his prejudice against quartz-mining was

remarkable, considering how he came by it.  Couldn't you ever cure him of

it?"



"Cure him!  No!  When Tom Quartz was sot once, he was always sot--and you

might a blowed him up as much as three million times 'n' you'd never a

broken him of his cussed prejudice agin quartz mining."



The affection and the pride that lit up Baker's face when he delivered

this tribute to the firmness of his humble friend of other days, will

always be a vivid memory with me.



At the end of two months we had never "struck" a pocket.  We had panned

up and down the hillsides till they looked plowed like a field; we could

have put in a crop of grain, then, but there would have been no way to

get it to market.  We got many good "prospects," but when the gold gave

out in the pan and we dug down, hoping and longing, we found only

emptiness--the pocket that should have been there was as barren as our

own.--At last we shouldered our pans and shovels and struck out over the

hills to try new localities.  We prospected around Angel's Camp, in

Calaveras county, during three weeks, but had no success.  Then we

wandered on foot among the mountains, sleeping under the trees at night,

for the weather was mild, but still we remained as centless as the last

rose of summer.  That is a poor joke, but it is in pathetic harmony with

the circumstances, since we were so poor ourselves.  In accordance with

the custom of the country, our door had always stood open and our board

welcome to tramping miners--they drifted along nearly every day, dumped

their paust shovels by the threshold and took "pot luck" with us--and now

on our own tramp we never found cold hospitality.



Our wanderings were wide and in many directions; and now I could give the

reader a vivid description of the Big Trees and the marvels of the Yo

Semite--but what has this reader done to me that I should persecute him?

I will deliver him into the hands of less conscientious tourists and take

his blessing.  Let me be charitable, though I fail in all virtues else.



Note: Some of the phrases in the above are mining technicalities, purely,

and may be a little obscure to the general reader.  In "placer diggings"

the gold is scattered all through the surface dirt; in "pocket" diggings

it is concentrated in one little spot; in "quartz" the gold is in a

solid, continuous vein of rock, enclosed between distinct walls of some

other kind of stone--and this is the most laborious and expensive of all

the different kinds of mining.  "Prospecting" is hunting for a "placer";

"indications" are signs of its presence; "panning out" refers to the

washing process by which the grains of gold are separated from the dirt;

a "prospect" is what one finds in the first panful of dirt--and its value

determines whether it is a good or a bad prospect, and whether it is

worth while to tarry there or seek further.









CHAPTER LXII.



After a three months' absence, I found myself in San Francisco again,

without a cent.  When my credit was about exhausted, (for I had become

too mean and lazy, now, to work on a morning paper, and there were no

vacancies on the evening journals,) I was created San Francisco

correspondent of the Enterprise, and at the end of five months I was out

of debt, but my interest in my work was gone; for my correspondence being

a daily one, without rest or respite, I got unspeakably tired of it.

I wanted another change.  The vagabond instinct was strong upon me.

Fortune favored and I got a new berth and a delightful one.  It was to go

down to the Sandwich Islands and write some letters for the Sacramento

Union, an excellent journal and liberal with employees.



We sailed in the propeller Ajax, in the middle of winter.  The almanac

called it winter, distinctly enough, but the weather was a compromise

between spring and summer.  Six days out of port, it became summer

altogether.  We had some thirty passengers; among them a cheerful soul

by the name of Williams, and three sea-worn old whaleship captains going

down to join their vessels.  These latter played euchre in the smoking

room day and night, drank astonishing quantities of raw whisky without

being in the least affected by it, and were the happiest people I think

I ever saw.  And then there was "the old Admiral--"  a retired whaleman.

He was a roaring, terrific combination of wind and lightning and thunder,

and earnest, whole-souled profanity.  But nevertheless he was tender-

hearted as a girl.  He was a raving, deafening, devastating typhoon,

laying waste the cowering seas but with an unvexed refuge in the centre

where all comers were safe and at rest.  Nobody could know the "Admiral"

without liking him; and in a sudden and dire emergency I think no friend

of his would know which to choose--to be cursed by him or prayed for by a

less efficient person.



His Title of "Admiral" was more strictly "official" than any ever worn by

a naval officer before or since, perhaps--for it was the voluntary

offering of a whole nation, and came direct from the people themselves

without any intermediate red tape--the people of the Sandwich Islands.

It was a title that came to him freighted with affection, and honor, and

appreciation of his unpretending merit.  And in testimony of the

genuineness of the title it was publicly ordained that an exclusive flag

should be devised for him and used solely to welcome his coming and wave

him God-speed in his going.  From that time forth, whenever his ship was

signaled in the offing, or he catted his anchor and stood out to sea,

that ensign streamed from the royal halliards on the parliament house and

the nation lifted their hats to it with spontaneous accord.



Yet he had never fired a gun or fought a battle in his life.  When I knew

him on board the Ajax, he was seventy-two years old and had plowed the

salt water sixty-one of them.  For sixteen years he had gone in and out

of the harbor of Honolulu in command of a whaleship, and for sixteen more

had been captain of a San Francisco and Sandwich Island passenger packet

and had never had an accident or lost a vessel.  The simple natives knew

him for a friend who never failed them, and regarded him as children

regard a father.  It was a dangerous thing to oppress them when the

roaring Admiral was around.



Two years before I knew the Admiral, he had retired from the sea on a

competence, and had sworn a colossal nine-jointed oath that he would

"never go within smelling distance of the salt water again as long as he

lived."  And he had conscientiously kept it.  That is to say, he

considered he had kept it, and it would have been more than dangerous to

suggest to him, even in the gentlest way, that making eleven long sea

voyages, as a passenger, during the two years that had transpired since

he "retired," was only keeping the general spirit of it and not the

strict letter.



The Admiral knew only one narrow line of conduct to pursue in any and all

cases where there was a fight, and that was to shoulder his way straight

in without an inquiry as to the rights or the merits of it, and take the

part of the weaker side.--And this was the reason why he was always sure

to be present at the trial of any universally execrated criminal to

oppress and intimidate the jury with a vindictive pantomime of what he

would do to them if he ever caught them out of the box.  And this was why

harried cats and outlawed dogs that knew him confidently took sanctuary

under his chair in time of trouble.  In the beginning he was the most

frantic and bloodthirsty Union man that drew breath in the shadow of the

Flag; but the instant the Southerners began to go down before the sweep

of the Northern armies, he ran up the Confederate colors and from that

time till the end was a rampant and inexorable secessionist.



He hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity than any

individual I have ever met, of either sex; and he was never tired of

storming against it and beseeching friends and strangers alike to be wary

and drink with moderation.  And yet if any creature had been guileless

enough to intimate that his absorbing nine gallons of "straight" whiskey

during our voyage was any fraction short of rigid or inflexible

abstemiousness, in that self-same moment the old man would have spun him

to the uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath.  Mind,

I am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs, for it did

not, in even the slightest degree.  He was a capacious container, but he

did not hold enough for that.  He took a level tumblerful of whisky every

morning before he put his clothes on--"to sweeten his bilgewater," he

said.--He took another after he got the most of his clothes on, "to

settle his mind and give him his bearings."  He then shaved, and put on a

clean shirt; after which he recited the Lord's Prayer in a fervent,

thundering bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all

conversation in the main cabin.  Then, at this stage, being invariably

"by the head," or "by the stern," or "listed to port or starboard," he

took one more to "put him on an even keel so that he would mind his

hellum and not miss stays and go about, every time he came up in the

wind."--And now, his state-room door swung open and the sun of his

benignant face beamed redly out upon men and women and children, and he

roared his "Shipmets a'hoy!" in a way that was calculated to wake the

dead and precipitate the final resurrection; and forth he strode, a

picture to look at and a presence to enforce attention.  Stalwart and

portly; not a gray hair; broadbrimmed slouch hat; semi-sailor toggery of

blue navy flannel--roomy and ample; a stately expanse of shirt-front and

a liberal amount of black silk neck-cloth tied with a sailor knot; large

chain and imposing seals impending from his fob; awe-inspiring feet, and

"a hand like the hand of Providence," as his whaling brethren expressed

it; wrist-bands and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow, out of

respect for the warm weather, and exposing hairy arms, gaudy with red and

blue anchors, ships, and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India ink.

But these details were only secondary matters--his face was the lodestone

that chained the eye.  It was a sultry disk, glowing determinedly out

through a weather beaten mask of mahogany, and studded with warts, seamed

with scars, "blazed" all over with unfailing fresh slips of the razor;

and with cheery eyes, under shaggy brows, contemplating the world from

over the back of a gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out

of the undulating immensity that spread away from its foundations.

At his heels frisked the darling of his bachelor estate, his terrier

"Fan," a creature no larger than a squirrel.  The main part of his daily

life was occupied in looking after "Fan," in a motherly way, and

doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his

imagination.



The Admiral seldom read newspapers; and when he did he never believed

anything they said.  He read nothing, and believed in nothing, but "The

Old Guard," a secession periodical published in New York.  He carried a

dozen copies of it with him, always, and referred to them for all

required information.  If it was not there, he supplied it himself, out

of a bountiful fancy, inventing history, names, dates, and every thing

else necessary to make his point good in an argument.  Consequently he

was a formidable antagonist in a dispute.  Whenever he swung clear of the

record and began to create history, the enemy was helpless and had to

surrender.  Indeed, the enemy could not keep from betraying some little

spark of indignation at his manufactured history--and when it came to

indignation, that was the Admiral's very "best hold."  He was always

ready for a political argument, and if nobody started one he would do it

himself.  With his third retort his temper would begin to rise, and

within five minutes he would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his

smoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left

solitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the chairs,

and roaring a hurricane of profanity.  It got so, after a while, that

whenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his eye, the passengers

would drop out with quiet accord, afraid to meet him; and he would camp

on a deserted field.



But he found his match at last, and before a full company.  At one time

or another, everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed,

except the quiet passenger Williams.  He had never been able to get an

expression of opinion out of him on politics.  But now, just as the

Admiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out,

Williams said:



"Admiral, are you certain about that circumstance concerning the

clergymen you mentioned the other day?"--referring to a piece of the

Admiral's manufactured history.



Every one was amazed at the man's rashness.  The idea of deliberately

inviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible.  The retreat came to

a halt; then everybody sat down again wondering, to await the upshot of

it.  The Admiral himself was as surprised as any one.  He paused in the

door, with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face, and

contemplated the daring reptile in the corner.



"Certain of it?  Am I certain of it?  Do you think I've been lying about

it?  What do you take me for?  Anybody that don't know that circumstance,

don't know anything; a child ought to know it.  Read up your history!

Read it up-----, and don't come asking a man if he's certain about a bit

of ABC stuff that the very southern niggers know all about."



Here the Admiral's fires began to wax hot, the atmosphere thickened, the

coming earthquake rumbled, he began to thunder and lighten.  Within three

minutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames

and ashes of indignation, belching black volumes of foul history aloft,

and vomiting red-hot torrents of profanity from his crater.  Meantime

Williams sat silent, and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in

what the old man was saying.  By and by, when the lull came, he said in

the most deferential way, and with the gratified air of a man who has had

a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably:



"Now I understand it.  I always thought I knew that piece of history well

enough, but was still afraid to trust it, because there was not that

convincing particularity about it that one likes to have in history; but

when you mentioned every name, the other day, and every date, and every

little circumstance, in their just order and sequence, I said to myself,

this sounds something like--this is history--this is putting it in a

shape that gives a man confidence; and I said to myself afterward, I will

just ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about the details, and if

he is I will come out and thank him for clearing this matter up for me.

And that is what I want to do now--for until you set that matter right it

was nothing but just a confusion in my mind, without head or tail to it."



Nobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before, and so pleased.

Nobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before; its

genuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks;

but here was a man that not only swallowed it all down, but was grateful

for the dose.  He was taken a back; he hardly knew what to say; even his

profanity failed him.  Now, Williams continued, modestly and earnestly:



"But Admiral, in saying that this was the first stone thrown, and that

this precipitated the war, you have overlooked a circumstance which you

are perfectly familiar with, but which has escaped your memory.  Now I

grant you that what you have stated is correct in every detail--to wit:

that on the 16th of October, 1860, two Massachusetts clergymen, named

Waite and Granger, went in disguise to the house of John Moody, in

Rockport, at dead of night, and dragged forth two southern women and

their two little children, and after tarring and feathering them conveyed

them to Boston and burned them alive in the State House square; and I

also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the secession

of South Carolina on the 20th of December following.  Very well."  [Here

the company were pleasantly surprised to hear Williams proceed to come

back at the Admiral with his own invincible weapon--clean, pure,

manufactured history, without a word of truth in it.]  "Very well, I say.

But Admiral, why overlook the Willis and Morgan case in South Carolina?

You are too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance.

Your arguments and your conversations have shown you to be intimately

conversant with every detail of this national quarrel.  You develop

matters of history every day that show plainly that you are no smatterer

in it, content to nibble about the surface, but a man who has searched

the depths and possessed yourself of everything that has a bearing upon

the great question.  Therefore, let me just recall to your mind that

Willis and Morgan case--though I see by your face that the whole thing is

already passing through your memory at this moment.  On the 12th of

August, 1860, two months before the Waite and Granger affair, two South

Carolina clergymen, named John H. Morgan and Winthrop L.  Willis, one a

Methodist and the other an Old School Baptist, disguised themselves, and

went at midnight to the house of a planter named Thompson--Archibald F.

Thompson, Vice President under Thomas Jefferson,--and took thence, at

midnight, his widowed aunt, (a Northern woman,) and her adopted child, an

orphan--named Mortimer Highie, afflicted with epilepsy and suffering at

the time from white swelling on one of his legs, and compelled to walk on

crutches in consequence; and the two ministers, in spite of the pleadings

of the victims, dragged them to the bush, tarred and feathered them, and

afterward burned them at the stake in the city of Charleston.  You

remember perfectly well what a stir it made; you remember perfectly well

that even the Charleston Courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant,

of questionable propriety, and scarcely justifiable, and likewise that it

would not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued.  And you remember

also, that this thing was the cause of the Massachusetts outrage.  Who,

indeed, were the two Massachusetts ministers?  and who were the two

Southern women they burned?  I do not need to remind you, Admiral, with

your intimate knowledge of history, that Waite was the nephew of the

woman burned in Charleston; that Granger was her cousin in the second

degree, and that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H.

Morgan, and the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L. Willis.

Now, Admiral, it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first

provocation came from the Southern preachers and that the Northern ones

were justified in retaliating.  In your arguments you never yet have

shown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise

unfair, when authoritative history condemned your position, and therefore

I have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from the

Massachusetts ministers, in this matter, and transfer it to the South

Carolina clergymen where it justly belongs."



The Admiral was conquered.  This sweet spoken creature who swallowed his

fraudulent history as if it were the bread of life; basked in his furious

blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine; found only calm, even-handed

justice in his rampart partisanship; and flooded him with invented

history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no

rejecting it, was "too many" for him.  He stammered some awkward, profane

sentences about the-----Willis and Morgan business having escaped his

memory, but that he "remembered it now," and then, under pretence of

giving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of the battle

and went away, a vanquished man.  Then cheers and laughter went up, and

Williams, the ship's benefactor was a hero.  The news went about the

vessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic reception instituted in

the smoking room, and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the

conqueror.  The wheelman said afterward, that the Admiral stood up behind

the pilot house and "ripped and cursed all to himself" till he loosened

the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail.



The Admiral's power was broken.  After that, if he began argument,

somebody would bring Williams, and the old man would grow weak and begin

to quiet down at once.  And as soon as he was done, Williams in his

dulcet, insinuating way, would invent some history (referring for proof,

to the old man's own excellent memory and to copies of "The Old Guard"

known not to be in his possession) that would turn the tables completely

and leave the Admiral all abroad and helpless.  By and by he came to so

dread Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he

saw him approach, and finally ceased to mention politics altogether, and

from that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship.









CHAPTER LXIII.



On a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight, lying low on the

lonely sea, and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look.  After two

thousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one.  As we

approached, the imposing promontory of Diamond Head rose up out of the

ocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance, and presently the

details of the land began to make themselves manifest: first the line of

beach; then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of the

natives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain between twelve

and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level; with streets

from twenty to thirty feet wide, solid and level as a floor, most of them

straight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew.



The further I traveled through the town the better I liked it.  Every

step revealed a new contrast--disclosed something I was unaccustomed to.

In place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts of San Francisco, I saw

dwellings built of straw, adobies, and cream-colored pebble-and-shell-

conglomerated coral, cut into oblong blocks and laid in cement; also a

great number of neat white cottages, with green window-shutters; in place

of front yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around them, I saw

these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly clad with green grass, and

shaded by tall trees, through whose dense foliage the sun could scarcely

penetrate; in place of the customary geranium, calla lily, etc.,

languishing in dust and general debility, I saw luxurious banks and

thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a rain, and glowing with the

richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of San Francisco's pleasure

grove, the "Willows," I saw huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees,

with strange names and stranger appearance--trees that cast a shadow like

a thunder-cloud, and were able to stand alone without being tied to green

poles; in place of gold fish, wiggling around in glass globes, assuming

countless shades and degrees of distortion through the magnifying and

diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses, I saw cats--

Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats, long-tailed cats, bob-tailed cats, blind cats,

one-eyed cats, wall-eyed cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats,

white cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild

cats, singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of cats,

companies of cats, regiments of cats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats,

millions of cats, and all of them sleek, fat, lazy and sound asleep.

I looked on a multitude of people, some white, in white coats, vests,

pantaloons, even white cloth shoes, made snowy with chalk duly laid on

every morning; but the majority of the people were almost as dark as

negroes--women with comely features, fine black eyes, rounded forms,

inclining to the voluptuous, clad in a single bright red or white garment

that fell free and unconfined from shoulder to heel, long black hair

falling loose, gypsy hats, encircled with wreaths of natural flowers of a

brilliant carmine tint; plenty of dark men in various costumes, and some

with nothing on but a battered stove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a

very scant breech-clout;--certain smoke-dried children were clothed in

nothing but sunshine--a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed.



In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners,

I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the

ground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at whatever or

whoever happened along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I

walked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea

by the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light layer of

lava and cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of fathomless

perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that stands

dead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped and crowded

street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as the wind, on

fleet horses and astride, with gaudy riding-sashes, streaming like

banners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of Chinadom and

Brannan street slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of

jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of the hurry and

bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in the midst of a

Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in place of the

Golden City's skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on the one

side a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at hand, clad in

refreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool, chasm-like valleys--and in

front the grand sweep of the ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near

the shore, bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing

against the reef, and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea,

flecked with "white caps," and in the far horizon a single, lonely sail--

a mere accent-mark to emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that

were without sound or limit.  When the sun sunk down--the one intruder

from other realms and persistent in suggestions of them--it was tranced

luxury to sit in the perfumed air and forget that there was any world but

these enchanted islands.



It was such ecstacy to dream, and dream--till you got a bite.



A scorpion bite.  Then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and

kill the scorpion; and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or

brandy; and the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future.  Then

came an adjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the

day's journal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the

other--a whole community of them at a slap.  Then, observing an enemy

approaching,--a hairy tarantula on stilts--why not set the spittoon on

him?  It is done, and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous

idea of the magnitude of his reach.  Then to bed and become a promenade

for a centipede with forty-two legs on a side and every foot hot enough

to burn a hole through a raw-hide.  More soaking with alcohol, and a

resolution to examine the bed before entering it, in future.  Then wait,

and suffer, till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in

under the bar, then slip out quickly, shut them in and sleep peacefully

on the floor till morning.  Meantime it is comforting to curse the

tropics in occasional wakeful intervals.



We had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu, of course.  Oranges, pine-

apples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes, guavas, melons,

and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya, which is

deliciousness itself.  Then there is the tamarind.  I thought tamarinds

were made to eat, but that was probably not the idea.  I ate several, and

it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year.  They pursed up my

lips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my

sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours.



They sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them, and gave them

a "wire edge" that I was afraid would stay; but a citizen said "no, it

will come off when the enamel does"--which was comforting, at any rate.

I found, afterward, that only strangers eat tamarinds--but they only eat

them once.









CHAPTER LXIV.



In my diary of our third day in Honolulu, I find this:



I am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii to-night--especially about

sitting down in the presence of my betters.  I have ridden fifteen or

twenty miles on horse-back since 5 P.M.  and to tell the honest truth, I

have a delicacy about sitting down at all.



An excursion to Diamond Head and the King's Coacoanut Grove was planned

to-day--time, 4:30 P.M.--the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen

and three ladies.  They all started at the appointed hour except myself.

I was at the Government prison, (with Captain Fish and another whaleship-

skipper, Captain Phillips,) and got so interested in its examination that

I did not notice how quickly the time was passing.  Somebody remarked

that it was twenty minutes past five o'clock, and that woke me up.  It

was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was along with his

"turn out," as he calls a top-buggy that Captain Cook brought here in

1778, and a horse that was here when Captain Cook came.  Captain Phillips

takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of his horse, and to

his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were only sixteen

minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel--a distance which

has been estimated to be over half a mile.  But it took some fearful

driving.  The Captain's whip came down fast, and the blows started so

much dust out of the horse's hide that during the last half of the

journey we rode through an impenetrable fog, and ran by a pocket compass

in the hands of Captain Fish, a whaler of twenty-six years experience,

who sat there through the perilous voyage as self-possessed as if he had

been on the euchre-deck of his own ship, and calmly said, "Port your

helm--port," from time to time, and "Hold her a little free--steady--so--

so," and "Luff--hard down to starboard!" and never once lost his presence

of mind or betrayed the least anxiety by voice or manner.  When we came

to anchor at last, and Captain Phillips looked at his watch and said,

"Sixteen minutes--I told you it was in her!  that's over three miles an

hour!" I could see he felt entitled to a compliment, and so I said I had

never seen lightning go like that horse.  And I never had.



The landlord of the American said the party had been gone nearly an hour,

but that he could give me my choice of several horses that could overtake

them.  I said, never mind--I preferred a safe horse to a fast one--I

would like to have an excessively gentle horse--a horse with no spirit

whatever--a lame one, if he had such a thing.  Inside of five minutes I

was mounted, and perfectly satisfied with my outfit.  I had no time to

label him "This is a horse," and so if the public took him for a sheep I

cannot help it.  I was satisfied, and that was the main thing.  I could

see that he had as many fine points as any man's horse, and so I hung my

hat on one of them, behind the saddle, and swabbed the perspiration from

my face and started.  I named him after this island, "Oahu" (pronounced

O-waw-hee).  The first gate he came to he started in; I had neither whip

nor spur, and so I simply argued the case with him.  He resisted

argument, but ultimately yielded to insult and abuse.  He backed out of

that gate and steered for another one on the other side of the street.

I triumphed by my former process.  Within the next six hundred yards he

crossed the street fourteen times and attempted thirteen gates, and in

the meantime the tropical sun was beating down and threatening to cave

the top of my head in, and I was literally dripping with perspiration.

He abandoned the gate business after that and went along peaceably

enough, but absorbed in meditation.  I noticed this latter circumstance,

and it soon began to fill me with apprehension.  I said to my self, this

creature is planning some new outrage, some fresh deviltry or other--no

horse ever thought over a subject so profoundly as this one is doing just

for nothing.  The more this thing preyed upon my mind the more uneasy I

became, until the suspense became almost unbearable and I dismounted to

see if there was anything wild in his eye--for I had heard that the eye

of this noblest of our domestic animals is very expressive.



I cannot describe what a load of anxiety was lifted from my mind when I

found that he was only asleep.  I woke him up and started him into a

faster walk, and then the villainy of his nature came out again.  He

tried to climb over a stone wall, five or six feet high.  I saw that I

must apply force to this horse, and that I might as well begin first as

last.  I plucked a stout switch from a tamarind tree, and the moment he

saw it, he surrendered.  He broke into a convulsive sort of a canter,

which had three short steps in it and one long one, and reminded me

alternately of the clattering shake of the great earthquake, and the

sweeping plunging of the Ajax in a storm.



And now there can be no fitter occasion than the present to pronounce a

left-handed blessing upon the man who invented the American saddle.

There is no seat to speak of about it--one might as well sit in a shovel-

-and the stirrups are nothing but an ornamental nuisance.  If I were to

write down here all the abuse I expended on those stirrups, it would make

a large book, even without pictures.  Sometimes I got one foot so far

through, that the stirrup partook of the nature of an anklet; sometimes

both feet were through, and I was handcuffed by the legs; and sometimes

my feet got clear out and left the stirrups wildly dangling about my

shins.  Even when I was in proper position and carefully balanced upon

the balls of my feet, there was no comfort in it, on account of my

nervous dread that they were going to slip one way or the other in a

moment.  But the subject is too exasperating to write about.



A mile and a half from town, I came to a grove of tall cocoanut trees,

with clean, branchless stems reaching straight up sixty or seventy feet

and topped with a spray of green foliage sheltering clusters of cocoa-

nuts--not more picturesque than a forest of collossal ragged parasols,

with bunches of magnified grapes under them, would be.



I once heard a gouty northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree might be

poetical, possibly it was; but it looked like a feather-duster struck by

lightning.  I think that describes it better than a picture--and yet,

without any question, there is something fascinating about a cocoa-nut

tree--and graceful, too.



About a dozen cottages, some frame and the others of native grass,

nestled sleepily in the shade here and there.  The grass cabins are of a

grayish color, are shaped much like our own cottages, only with higher

and steeper roofs usually, and are made of some kind of weed strongly

bound together in bundles.  The roofs are very thick, and so are the

walls; the latter have square holes in them for windows.  At a little

distance these cabins have a furry appearance, as if they might be made

of bear skins.  They are very cool and pleasant inside.  The King's flag

was flying from the roof of one of the cottages, and His Majesty was

probably within.  He owns the whole concern thereabouts, and passes his

time there frequently, on sultry days "laying off."  The spot is called

"The King's Grove."



Near by is an interesting ruin--the meagre remains of an ancient heathen

temple--a place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old

bygone days when the simple child of nature, yielding momentarily to sin

when sorely tempted, acknowledged his error when calm reflection had

shown it him, and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his

grandmother as an atoning sacrifice--in those old days when the luckless

sinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical

happiness as long as his relations held out; long, long before the

missionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them

permanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a

place heaven is, and how nearly impossible it is to get there; and showed

the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what unnecessarily

liberal facilities there are for going to it; showed him how, in his

ignorance he had gone and fooled away all his kinfolks to no purpose;

showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty cents to buy

food for next day with, as compared with fishing for pastime and lolling

in the shade through eternal Summer, and eating of the bounty that nobody

labored to provide but Nature.  How sad it is to think of the multitudes

who have gone to their graves in this beautiful island and never knew

there was a hell!



This ancient temple was built of rough blocks of lava, and was simply a

roofless inclosure a hundred and thirty feet long and seventy wide--

nothing but naked walls, very thick, but not much higher than a man's

head.  They will last for ages no doubt, if left unmolested.  Its three

altars and other sacred appurtenances have crumbled and passed away years

ago.  It is said that in the old times thousands of human beings were

slaughtered here, in the presence of naked and howling savages.  If these

mute stones could speak, what tales they could tell, what pictures they

could describe, of fettered victims writhing under the knife; of massed

forms straining forward out of the gloom, with ferocious faces lit up by

the sacrificial fires; of the background of ghostly trees; of the dark

pyramid of Diamond Head standing sentinel over the uncanny scene, and the

peaceful moon looking down upon it through rifts in the cloud-rack!



When Kamehameha (pronounced Ka-may-ha-may-ah) the Great--who was a sort

of a Napoleon in military genius and uniform success--invaded this island

of Oahu three quarters of a century ago, and exterminated the army sent

to oppose him, and took full and final possession of the country, he

searched out the dead body of the King of Oahu, and those of the

principal chiefs, and impaled their heads on the walls of this temple.



Those were savage times when this old slaughter-house was in its prime.

The King and the chiefs ruled the common herd with a rod of iron; made

them gather all the provisions the masters needed; build all the houses

and temples; stand all the expenses, of whatever kind; take kicks and

cuffs for thanks; drag out lives well flavored with misery, and then

suffer death for trifling offences or yield up their lives on the

sacrificial altars to purchase favors from the gods for their hard

rulers.  The missionaries have clothed them, educated them, broken up the

tyrannous authority of their chiefs, and given them freedom and the right

to enjoy whatever their hands and brains produce with equal laws for all,

and punishment for all alike who transgress them.  The contrast is so

strong--the benefit conferred upon this people by the missionaries is so

prominent, so palpable and so unquestionable, that the frankest

compliment I can pay them, and the best, is simply to point to the

condition of the Sandwich Islanders of Captain Cook's time, and their

condition to-day.



Their work speaks for itself.









CHAPTER LXV.



By and by, after a rugged climb, we halted on the summit of a hill which

commanded a far-reaching view.  The moon rose and flooded mountain and

valley and ocean with a mellow radiance, and out of the shadows of the

foliage the distant lights of Honolulu glinted like an encampment of

fireflies.  The air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers.  The halt

was brief.--Gayly laughing and talking, the party galloped on, and I

clung to the pommel and cantered after.  Presently we came to a place

where no grass grew--a wide expanse of deep sand.  They said it was an

old battle ground.  All around everywhere, not three feet apart, the

bleached bones of men gleamed white in the moonlight.  We picked up a lot

of them for mementoes.  I got quite a number of arm bones and leg bones--

of great chiefs, may be, who had fought savagely in that fearful battle

in the old days, when blood flowed like wine where we now stood--and wore

the choicest of them out on Oahu afterward, trying to make him go.  All

sorts of bones could be found except skulls; but a citizen said,

irreverently, that there had been an unusual number of "skull-hunters"

there lately--a species of sportsmen I had never heard of before.



Nothing whatever is known about this place--its story is a secret that

will never be revealed.  The oldest natives make no pretense of being

possessed of its history.  They say these bones were here when they were

children.  They were here when their grandfathers were children--but how

they came here, they can only conjecture.  Many people believe this spot

to be an ancient battle-ground, and it is usual to call it so; and they

believe that these skeletons have lain for ages just where their

proprietors fell in the great fight.  Other people believe that

Kamehameha I.  fought his first battle here.  On this point, I have heard

a story, which may have been taken from one of the numerous books which

have been written concerning these islands--I do not know where the

narrator got it.  He said that when Kamehameha (who was at first merely a

subordinate chief on the island of Hawaii), landed here, he brought a

large army with him, and encamped at Waikiki.  The Oahuans marched

against him, and so confident were they of success that they readily

acceded to a demand of their priests that they should draw a line where

these bones now lie, and take an oath that, if forced to retreat at all,

they would never retreat beyond this boundary.  The priests told them

that death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated the

oath, and the march was resumed.  Kamehameha drove them back step by

step; the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted them both by

voice and inspiriting example to remember their oath--to die, if need be,

but never cross the fatal line.  The struggle was manfully maintained,

but at last the chief priest fell, pierced to the heart with a spear, and

the unlucky omen fell like a blight upon the brave souls at his back;

with a triumphant shout the invaders pressed forward--the line was

crossed--the offended gods deserted the despairing army, and, accepting

the doom their perjury had brought upon them, they broke and fled over

the plain where Honolulu stands now--up the beautiful Nuuanu Valley--

paused a moment, hemmed in by precipitous mountains on either hand and

the frightful precipice of the Pari in front, and then were driven over--

a sheer plunge of six hundred feet!



The story is pretty enough, but Mr. Jarves' excellent history says the

Oahuans were intrenched in Nuuanu Valley; that Kamehameha ousted them,

routed them, pursued them up the valley and drove them over the

precipice.  He makes no mention of our bone-yard at all in his book.



Impressed by the profound silence and repose that rested over the

beautiful landscape, and being, as usual, in the rear, I gave voice to my

thoughts.  I said:



"What a picture is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the moon!  How

strong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand out against the

clear sky!  What a snowy fringe marks the bursting of the surf over the

long, curved reef!  How calmly the dim city sleeps yonder in the plain!

How soft the shadows lie upon the stately mountains that border the

dream-haunted Mauoa Valley!  What a grand pyramid of billowy clouds

towers above the storied Pari!  How the grim warriors of the past seem

flocking in ghostly squadrons to their ancient battlefield again--how the

wails of the dying well up from the--"



At this point the horse called Oahu sat down in the sand.  Sat down to

listen, I suppose.  Never mind what he heard, I stopped apostrophising

and convinced him that I was not a man to allow contempt of Court on the

part of a horse.  I broke the back-bone of a Chief over his rump and set

out to join the cavalcade again.



Very considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 9 o'clock at night,

myself in the lead--for when my horse finally came to understand that he

was homeward bound and hadn't far to go, he turned his attention strictly

to business.



This is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information.  There is no

regular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, in any part of the Kingdom

of Hawaii; therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy residents

(who all have good horses), you must hire animals of the wretchedest

description from the Kanakas.  (i.e.  natives.) Any horse you hire, even

though it be from a white man, is not often of much account, because it

will be brought in for you from some ranch, and has necessarily been

leading a hard life.  If the Kanakas who have been caring for him

(inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to death every day

themselves, you can depend upon it they have been doing the same thing by

proxy, by clandestinely hiring him out.  At least, so I am informed.  The

result is, that no horse has a chance to eat, drink, rest, recuperate, or

look well or feel well, and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as

I was to-day.



In hiring a horse from a Kanaka, you must have all your eyes about you,

because you can rest satisfied that you are dealing with a shrewd

unprincipled rascal.  You may leave your door open and your trunk

unlocked as long as you please, and he will not meddle with your

property; he has no important vices and no inclination to commit robbery

on a large scale; but if he can get ahead of you in the horse business,

he will take a genuine delight in doing it.  This traits is

characteristic of horse jockeys, the world over, is it not?  He will

overcharge you if he can; he will hire you a fine-looking horse at night

(anybody's--may be the King's, if the royal steed be in convenient view),

and bring you the mate to my Oahu in the morning, and contend that it is

the same animal.  If you make trouble, he will get out by saying it was

not himself who made the bargain with you, but his brother, "who went out

in the country this morning."  They have always got a "brother" to shift

the responsibility upon.  A victim said to one of these fellows one day:



"But I know I hired the horse of you, because I noticed that scar on your

cheek."



The reply was not bad: "Oh, yes--yes--my brother all same--we twins!"



A friend of mine, J.  Smith, hired a horse yesterday, the Kanaka

warranting him to be in excellent condition.



Smith had a saddle and blanket of his own, and he ordered the Kanaka to

put these on the horse.  The Kanaka protested that he was perfectly

willing to trust the gentleman with the saddle that was already on the

animal, but Smith refused to use it.  The change was made; then Smith

noticed that the Kanaka had only changed the saddles, and had left the

original blanket on the horse; he said he forgot to change the blankets,

and so, to cut the bother short, Smith mounted and rode away.  The horse

went lame a mile from town, and afterward got to cutting up some

extraordinary capers.  Smith got down and took off the saddle, but the

blanket stuck fast to the horse--glued to a procession of raw places.

The Kanaka's mysterious conduct stood explained.



Another friend of mine bought a pretty good horse from a native, a day or

two ago, after a tolerably thorough examination of the animal.  He

discovered today that the horse was as blind as a bat, in one eye.  He

meant to have examined that eye, and came home with a general notion that

he had done it; but he remembers now that every time he made the attempt

his attention was called to something else by his victimizer.



One more instance, and then I will pass to something else.  I am informed

that when a certain Mr. L., a visiting stranger, was here, he bought a

pair of very respectable-looking match horses from a native.  They were

in a little stable with a partition through the middle of it--one horse

in each apartment.  Mr. L.  examined one of them critically through a

window (the Kanaka's "brother" having gone to the country with the key),

and then went around the house and examined the other through a window on

the other side.  He said it was the neatest match he had ever seen, and

paid for the horses on the spot.  Whereupon the Kanaka departed to join

his brother in the country.  The fellow had shamefully swindled L.  There

was only one "match" horse, and he had examined his starboard side

through one window and his port side through another!  I decline to

believe this story, but I give it because it is worth something as a

fanciful illustration of a fixed fact--namely, that the Kanaka horse-

jockey is fertile in invention and elastic in conscience.



You can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars, and a good

enough horse for all practical purposes for two dollars and a half.  I

estimate "Oahu" to be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five

cents.  A good deal better animal than he is was sold here day before

yesterday for a dollar and seventy-five cents, and sold again to-day for

two dollars and twenty-five cents; Williams bought a handsome and lively

little pony yesterday for ten dollars; and about the best common horse on

the island (and he is a really good one) sold yesterday, with Mexican

saddle and bridle, for seventy dollars--a horse which is well and widely

known, and greatly respected for his speed, good disposition and

everlasting bottom.



You give your horse a little grain once a day; it comes from San

Francisco, and is worth about two cents a pound; and you give him as much

hay as he wants; it is cut and brought to the market by natives, and is

not very good it is baled into long, round bundles, about the size of a

large man; one of them is stuck by the middle on each end of a six foot

pole, and the Kanaka shoulders the pole and walks about the streets

between the upright bales in search of customers.  These hay bales, thus

carried, have a general resemblance to a colossal capital 'H.'



The hay-bundles cost twenty-five cents apiece, and one will last a horse

about a day.  You can get a horse for a song, a week's hay for another

song, and you can turn your animal loose among the luxuriant grass in

your neighbor's broad front yard without a song at all--you do it at

midnight, and stable the beast again before morning.  You have been at no

expense thus far, but when you come to buy a saddle and bridle they will

cost you from twenty to thirty-five dollars.  You can hire a horse,

saddle and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week, and the owner will

take care of them at his own expense.



It is time to close this day's record--bed time.  As I prepare for sleep,

a rich voice rises out of the still night, and, far as this ocean rock is

toward the ends of the earth, I recognize a familiar home air.  But the

words seem somewhat out of joint:





"Waikiki lantoni oe Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo."



Translated, that means "When we were marching through Georgia."









CHAPTER LXVI.



Passing through the market place we saw that feature of Honolulu under

its most favorable auspices--that is, in the full glory of Saturday

afternoon, which is a festive day with the natives.  The native girls by

twos and threes and parties of a dozen, and sometimes in whole platoons

and companies, went cantering up and down the neighboring streets astride

of fleet but homely horses, and with their gaudy riding habits streaming

like banners behind them.  Such a troop of free and easy riders, in their

natural home, the saddle, makes a gay and graceful spectacle.  The riding

habit I speak of is simply a long, broad scarf, like a tavern table cloth

brilliantly colored, wrapped around the loins once, then apparently

passed between the limbs and each end thrown backward over the same, and

floating and flapping behind on both sides beyond the horse's tail like a

couple of fancy flags; then, slipping the stirrup-irons between her toes,

the girl throws her chest for ward, sits up like a Major General and goes

sweeping by like the wind.



The girls put on all the finery they can on Saturday afternoon--fine

black silk robes; flowing red ones that nearly put your eyes out; others

as white as snow; still others that discount the rainbow; and they wear

their hair in nets, and trim their jaunty hats with fresh flowers, and

encircle their dusky throats with home-made necklaces of the brilliant

vermillion-tinted blossom of the ohia; and they fill the markets and the

adjacent street with their bright presences, and smell like a rag factory

on fire with their offensive cocoanut oil.



Occasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away down in the

South Seas, with his face and neck tatooed till he looks like the

customary mendicant from Washoe who has been blown up in a mine.  Some

are tattooed a dead blue color down to the upper lip--masked, as it were

--leaving the natural light yellow skin of Micronesia unstained from

thence down; some with broad marks drawn down from hair to neck, on both

sides of the face, and a strip of the original yellow skin, two inches

wide, down the center--a gridiron with a spoke broken out; and some with

the entire face discolored with the popular mortification tint, relieved

only by one or two thin, wavy threads of natural yellow running across

the face from ear to ear, and eyes twinkling out of this darkness, from

under shadowing hat-brims, like stars in the dark of the moon.



Moving among the stirring crowds, you come to the poi merchants,

squatting in the shade on their hams, in true native fashion, and

surrounded by purchasers.  (The Sandwich Islanders always squat on their

hams, and who knows but they may be the old original "ham sandwiches?"

The thought is pregnant with interest.) The poi looks like common flour

paste, and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of gourd, and

capable of holding from one to three or four gallons.  Poi is the chief

article of food among the natives, and is prepared from the taro plant.



The taro root looks like a thick, or, if you please, a corpulent sweet

potato, in shape, but is of a light purple color when boiled.  When

boiled it answers as a passable substitute for bread.  The buck Kanakas

bake it under ground, then mash it up well with a heavy lava pestle, mix

water with it until it becomes a paste, set it aside and let if ferment,

and then it is poi--and an unseductive mixture it is, almost tasteless

before it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward.  But nothing is

more nutritious.  When solely used, however, it produces acrid humors, a

fact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of the

Kanakas.  I think there must be as much of a knack in handling poi as

there is in eating with chopsticks.  The forefinger is thrust into the

mess and stirred quickly round several times and drawn as quickly out,

thickly coated, just as it it were poulticed; the head is thrown back,

the finger inserted in the mouth and the delicacy stripped off and

swallowed--the eye closing gently, meanwhile, in a languid sort of

ecstasy.  Many a different finger goes into the same bowl and many a

different kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the

virtues of its contents.



Around a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives buying the awa

root.  It is said that but for the use of this root the destruction of

the people in former times by certain imported diseases would have been

far greater than it was, and by others it is said that this is merely a

fancy.  All agree that poi will rejuvenate a man who is used up and his

vitality almost annihilated by hard drinking, and that in some kinds of

diseases it will restore health after all medicines have failed; but all

are not willing to allow to the awa the virtues claimed for it.  The

natives manufacture an intoxicating drink from it which is fearful in its

effects when persistently indulged in.  It covers the body with dry,

white scales, inflames the eyes, and causes premature decripitude.

Although the man before whose establishment we stopped has to pay a

Government license of eight hundred dollars a year for the exclusive

right to sell awa root, it is said that he makes a small fortune every

twelve-month; while saloon keepers, who pay a thousand dollars a year for

the privilege of retailing whiskey, etc., only make a bare living.



We found the fish market crowded; for the native is very fond of fish,

and eats the article raw and alive!  Let us change the subject.



In old times here Saturday was a grand gala day indeed.  All the native

population of the town forsook their labors, and those of the surrounding

country journeyed to the city.  Then the white folks had to stay indoors,

for every street was so packed with charging cavaliers and cavalieresses

that it was next to impossible to thread one's way through the cavalcades

without getting crippled.



At night they feasted and the girls danced the lascivious hula hula--a

dance that is said to exhibit the very perfection of educated notion of

limb and arm, hand, head and body, and the exactest uniformity of

movement and accuracy of "time."  It was performed by a circle of girls

with no raiment on them to speak of, who went through an infinite variety

of motions and figures without prompting, and yet so true was their

"time," and in such perfect concert did they move that when they were

placed in a straight line, hands, arms, bodies, limbs and heads waved,

swayed, gesticulated, bowed, stooped, whirled, squirmed, twisted and

undulated as if they were part and parcel of a single individual; and it

was difficult to believe they were not moved in a body by some exquisite

piece of mechanism.



Of late years, however, Saturday has lost most of its quondam gala

features.  This weekly stampede of the natives interfered too much with

labor and the interests of the white folks, and by sticking in a law

here, and preaching a sermon there, and by various other means, they

gradually broke it up.  The demoralizing hula hula was forbidden to be

performed, save at night, with closed doors, in presence of few

spectators, and only by permission duly procured from the authorities and

the payment of ten dollars for the same.  There are few girls now-a-days

able to dance this ancient national dance in the highest perfection of

the art.



The missionaries have christianized and educated all the natives.  They

all belong to the Church, and there is not one of them, above the age of

eight years, but can read and write with facility in the native tongue.

It is the most universally educated race of people outside of China.

They have any quantity of books, printed in the Kanaka language, and all

the natives are fond of reading.  They are inveterate church-goers--

nothing can keep them away.  All this ameliorating cultivation has at

last built up in the native women a profound respect for chastity--in

other people.  Perhaps that is enough to say on that head.  The national

sin will die out when the race does, but perhaps not earlier.--But

doubtless this purifying is not far off, when we reflect that contact

with civilization and the whites has reduced the native population from

four hundred thousand (Captain Cook's estimate,) to fifty-five thousand

in something over eighty years!



Society is a queer medley in this notable missionary, whaling and

governmental centre.  If you get into conversation with a stranger and

experience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are

treading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is, strike

out boldly and address him as "Captain."  Watch him narrowly, and if you

see by his countenance that you are on the wrong tack, ask him where he

preaches.  It is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of

a whaler.  I am now personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and

ninety-six missionaries.  The captains and ministers form one-half of the

population; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and mercantile

foreigners and their families, and the final fourth is made up of high

officers of the Hawaiian Government.  And there are just about cats

enough for three apiece all around.



A solemn stranger met me in the suburbs the other day, and said:



"Good morning, your reverence.  Preach in the stone church yonder, no

doubt?"



"No, I don't.  I'm not a preacher."



"Really, I beg your pardon, Captain.  I trust you had a good season.  How

much oil"--



"Oil?  What do you take me for?  I'm not a whaler."



"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons, your Excellency.



"Major General in the household troops, no doubt?  Minister of the

Interior, likely?  Secretary of war?  First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber?

Commissioner of the Royal"--



"Stuff!  I'm no official.  I'm not connected in any way with the

Government."



"Bless my life!  Then, who the mischief are you?  what the mischief are

you?  and how the mischief did you get here, and where in thunder did you

come from?"



"I'm only a private personage--an unassuming stranger--lately arrived

from America."



"No?  Not a missionary!  Not a whaler!  not a member of his Majesty's

Government!  not even Secretary of the Navy!  Ah, Heaven!  it is too

blissful to be true; alas, I do but dream.  And yet that noble, honest

countenance--those oblique, ingenuous eyes--that massive head, incapable

of--of--anything; your hand; give me your hand, bright waif.  Excuse

these tears.  For sixteen weary years I have yearned for a moment like

this, and"--



Here his feelings were too much for him, and he swooned away.  I pitied

this poor creature from the bottom of my heart.  I was deeply moved.  I

shed a few tears on him and kissed him for his mother.  I then took what

small change he had and "shoved".









CHAPTER LXVII.



I still quote from my journal:



I found the national Legislature to consist of half a dozen white men and

some thirty or forty natives.  It was a dark assemblage.  The nobles and

Ministers (about a dozen of them altogether) occupied the extreme left of

the hall, with David Kalakaua (the King's Chamberlain) and Prince William

at the head.  The President of the Assembly, His Royal Highness M.

Kekuanaoa, [Kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal.  He derives his princely

rank from his wife, who was a daughter of Kamehameha the Great.  Under

other monarchies the male line takes precedence of the female in tracing

genealogies, but here the opposite is the case--the female line takes

precedence.  Their reason for this is exceedingly sensible, and I

recommend it to the aristocracy of Europe: They say it is easy to know

who a man's mother was, but, etc., etc.] and the Vice President (the

latter a white man,) sat in the pulpit, if I may so term it.

The President is the King's father.  He is an erect, strongly built,

massive featured, white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of

age or thereabouts.  He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth coat

and white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust or blemish upon

them.  He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity, and is a man of

noble presence.  He was a young man and a distinguished warrior under

that terrific fighter, Kamehameha I., more than half a century ago.  A

knowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this: "This man,

naked as the day he was born, and war-club and spear in hand, has charged

at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of savages more

than a generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter and carnage;

has worshipped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen hundreds of

his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to wooden idols, at

a time when no missionary's foot had ever pressed this soil, and he had

never heard of the white man's God; has believed his enemy could secretly

pray him to death; has seen the day, in his childhood, when it was a

crime punishable by death for a man to eat with his wife, or for a

plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the King--and now look at him; an

educated Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a high-minded, elegant

gentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who has been the honored

guest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in holding the reins of an

enlightened government, and well versed in the politics of his country

and in general, practical information.  Look at him, sitting there

presiding over the deliberations of a legislative body, among whom are

white men--a grave, dignified, statesmanlike personage, and as seemingly

natural and fitted to the place as if he had been born in it and had

never been out of it in his life time.  How the experiences of this old

man's eventful life shame the cheap inventions of romance!"



The christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened some of their

barbarian superstitions, much less destroyed them.  I have just referred

to one of these.  It is still a popular belief that if your enemy can get

hold of any article belonging to you he can get down on his knees over it

and pray you to death.  Therefore many a native gives up and dies merely

because he imagines that some enemy is putting him through a course of

damaging prayer.  This praying an individual to death seems absurb enough

at a first glance, but then when we call to mind some of the pulpit

efforts of certain of our own ministers the thing looks plausible.



In former times, among the Islanders, not only a plurality of wives was

customary, but a plurality of husbands likewise.  Some native women of

noble rank had as many as six husbands.  A woman thus supplied did not

reside with all her husbands at once, but lived several months with each

in turn.  An understood sign hung at her door during these months.  When

the sign was taken down, it meant "NEXT."



In those days woman was rigidly taught to "know her place."  Her place

was to do all the work, take all the cuffs, provide all the food, and

content herself with what was left after her lord had finished his

dinner.  She was not only forbidden, by ancient law, and under penalty of

death, to eat with her husband or enter a canoe, but was debarred, under

the same penalty, from eating bananas, pine-apples, oranges and other

choice fruits at any time or in any place.  She had to confine herself

pretty strictly to "poi" and hard work.  These poor ignorant heathen seem

to have had a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in

the garden of Eden, and they did not choose to take any more chances.

But the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of things.

They liberated woman and made her the equal of man.



The natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their children

alive when the family became larger than necessary.  The missionaries

interfered in this matter too, and stopped it.



To this day the natives are able to lie down and die whenever they want

to, whether there is anything the matter with them or not.  If a Kanaka

takes a notion to die, that is the end of him; nobody can persuade him to

hold on; all the doctors in the world could not save him.



A luxury which they enjoy more than anything else, is a large funeral.

If a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native, it is only

necessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour and he will be

on hand to the minute--at least his remains will.



All the natives are Christians, now, but many of them still desert to the

Great Shark God for temporary succor in time of trouble.  An irruption of

the great volcano of Kilauea, or an earthquake, always brings a deal of

latent loyalty to the Great Shark God to the surface.  It is common

report that the King, educated, cultivated and refined Christian

gentleman as he undoubtedly is, still turns to the idols of his fathers

for help when disaster threatens.  A planter caught a shark, and one of

his christianized natives testified his emancipation from the thrall of

ancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a fashion

forbidden by his abandoned creed.  But remorse shortly began to torture

him.  He grew moody and sought solitude; brooded over his sin, refused

food, and finally said he must die and ought to die, for he had sinned

against the Great Shark God and could never know peace any more.  He was

proof against persuasion and ridicule, and in the course of a day or two

took to his bed and died, although he showed no symptom of disease.

His young daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate within the

week.  Superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone and it is

only natural that it should crop out in time of distress.  Wherever one

goes in the Islands, he will find small piles of stones by the wayside,

covered with leafy offerings, placed there by the natives to appease evil

spirits or honor local deities belonging to the mythology of former days.



In the rural districts of any of the Islands, the traveler hourly comes

upon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams or in the sea

without any clothing on and exhibiting no very intemperate zeal in the

matter of hiding their nakedness.  When the missionaries first took up

their residence in Honolulu, the native women would pay their families

frequent friendly visits, day by day, not even clothed with a blush.

It was found a hard matter to convince them that this was rather

indelicate.  Finally the missionaries provided them with long, loose

calico robes, and that ended the difficulty--for the women would troop

through the town, stark naked, with their robes folded under their arms,

march to the missionary houses and then  proceed to dress!--The natives

soon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing, but it was shortly

apparent that they only wanted it for grandeur.  The missionaries

imported a quantity of hats, bonnets, and other male and female wearing

apparel, instituted a general distribution, and begged the people not to

come to church naked, next Sunday, as usual.  And they did not; but the

national spirit of unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors who

were not at the distribution, and next Sabbath the poor preachers could

hardly keep countenance before their vast congregations.  In the midst of

the reading of a hymn a brown, stately dame would sweep up the aisle with

a world of airs, with nothing in the world on but a "stovepipe" hat and a

pair of cheap gloves; another dame would follow, tricked out in a man's

shirt, and nothing else; another one would enter with a flourish, with

simply the sleeves of a bright calico dress tied around her waist and the

rest of the garment dragging behind like a peacock's tail off duty; a

stately "buck" Kanaka would stalk in with a woman's bonnet on, wrong side

before--only this, and nothing more; after him would stride his fellow,

with the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied around his neck, the rest of

his person untrammeled; in his rear would come another gentleman simply

gotten up in a fiery neck-tie and a striped vest.



The poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly unconscious

of any absurdity in their appearance.  They gazed at each other with

happy admiration, and it was plain to see that the young girls were

taking note of what each other had on, as naturally as if they had always

lived in a land of Bibles and knew what churches were made for; here was

the evidence of a dawning civilization.  The spectacle which the

congregation presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving, that

the missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with

the services; and by and by when the simple children of the sun began a

general swapping of garments in open meeting and produced some

irresistibly grotesque effects in the course of re-dressing, there was

nothing for it but to cut the thing short with the benediction and

dismiss the fantastic assemblage.



In our country, children play "keep house;" and in the same high-sounding

but miniature way the grown folk here, with the poor little material of

slender territory and meagre population, play "empire."  There is his

royal Majesty the King, with a New York detective's income of thirty or

thirty-five thousand dollars a year from the "royal civil list" and the

"royal domain."  He lives in a two-story frame "palace."



And there is the "royal family"--the customary hive of royal brothers,

sisters, cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to monarchy,--

all with a spoon in the national pap-dish, and all bearing such titles as

his or her Royal Highness the Prince or Princess So-and-so.  Few of them

can carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in carriages, however;

they sport the economical Kanaka horse or "hoof it" with the plebeians.



Then there is his Excellency the "royal Chamberlain"--a sinecure, for his

majesty dresses himself with his own hands, except when he is ruralizing

at Waikiki and then he requires no dressing.



Next we have his Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the Household

Troops, whose forces consist of about the number of soldiers usually

placed under a corporal in other lands.



Next comes the royal Steward and the Grand Equerry in Waiting--high

dignitaries with modest salaries and little to do.



Then we have his Excellency the First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber--an

office as easy as it is magnificent.



Next we come to his Excellency the Prime Minister, a renegade American

from New Hampshire, all jaw, vanity, bombast and ignorance, a lawyer of

"shyster" calibre, a fraud by nature, a humble worshiper of the sceptre

above him, a reptile never tired of sneering at the land of his birth or

glorifying the ten-acre kingdom that has adopted him--salary, $4,000 a

year, vast consequence, and no perquisites.



Then we have his Excellency the Imperial Minister of Finance, who handles

a million dollars of public money a year, sends in his annual "budget"

with great ceremony, talks prodigiously of "finance," suggests imposing

schemes for paying off the "national debt" (of $150,000,) and does it all

for $4,000 a year and unimaginable glory.



Next we have his Excellency the Minister of War, who holds sway over the

royal armies--they consist of two hundred and thirty uniformed Kanakas,

mostly Brigadier Generals, and if the country ever gets into trouble with

a foreign power we shall probably hear from them.  I knew an American

whose copper-plate visiting card bore this impressive legend:

"Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Infantry."  To say that he was proud of

this distinction is stating it but tamely.  The Minister of War has also

in his charge some venerable swivels on Punch-Bowl Hill wherewith royal

salutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port.



Next comes his Excellency the Minister of the Navy--a nabob who rules the

"royal fleet," (a steam-tug and a sixty-ton schooner.)



And next comes his Grace the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the chief dignitary

of the "Established Church"--for when the American Presbyterian

missionaries had completed the reduction of the nation to a compact

condition of Christianity, native royalty stepped in and erected the

grand dignity of an "Established (Episcopal) Church" over it, and

imported a cheap ready-made Bishop from England to take charge.  The

chagrin of the missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed, to

this day, profanity not being admissible.



Next comes his Excellency the Minister of Public Instruction.



Next, their Excellencies the Governors of Oahu, Hawaii, etc., and after

them a string of High Sheriffs and other small fry too numerous for

computation.



Then there are their Excellencies the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister

Plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French; her

British Majesty's Minister; the Minister Resident, of the United States;

and some six or eight representatives of other foreign nations, all with

sounding titles, imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state.



Imagine all this grandeur in a play-house "kingdom" whose population

falls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls!



The people are so accustomed to nine-jointed titles and colossal magnates

that a foreign prince makes very little more stir in Honolulu than a

Western Congressman does in New York.



And let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined "court

costume" of so "stunning" a nature that it would make the clown in a

circus look tame and commonplace by comparison; and each Hawaiian

official dignitary has a gorgeous vari-colored, gold-laced uniform

peculiar to his office--no two of them are alike, and it is hard to tell

which one is the "loudest."  The King had a "drawing-room" at stated

intervals, like other monarchs, and when these varied uniforms congregate

there--weak-eyed people have to contemplate the spectacle through smoked

glass.  Is there not a gratifying contrast between this latter-day

exhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these magnates afforded

the missionaries the Sunday after the old-time distribution of clothing?

Behold what religion and civilization have wrought!









CHAPTER LXVIII.



While I was in Honolulu I witnessed the ceremonious funeral of the King's

sister, her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria.  According to the royal

custom, the remains had lain in state at the palace thirty days, watched

day and night by a guard of honor.  And during all that time a great

multitude of natives from the several islands had kept the palace grounds

well crowded and had made the place a pandemonium every night with their

howlings and wailings, beating of tom-toms and dancing of the (at other

times) forbidden "hula-hula" by half-clad maidens to the music of songs

of questionable decency chanted in honor of the deceased.  The printed

programme of the funeral procession interested me at the time; and after

what I have just said of Hawaiian grandiloquence in the matter of

"playing empire," I am persuaded that a perusal of it may interest the

reader:



      After reading the long list of dignitaries, etc., and remembering

      the sparseness of the population, one is almost inclined to wonder

      where the material for that portion of the procession devoted to

      "Hawaiian Population Generally" is going to be procured:

I resume my journal at the point where the procession arrived at the

royal mausoleum:



      As the procession filed through the gate, the military deployed

      handsomely to the right and left and formed an avenue through which

      the long column of mourners passed to the tomb.  The coffin was

      borne through the door of the mausoleum, followed by the King and

      his chiefs, the great officers of the kingdom, foreign Consuls,

      Embassadors and distinguished guests (Burlingame and General Van

      Valkenburgh).  Several of the kahilis were then fastened to a frame-

      work in front of the tomb, there to remain until they decay and fall

      to pieces, or, forestalling this, until another scion of royalty

      dies.  At this point of the proceedings the multitude set up such a

      heart-broken wailing as I hope never to hear again.



The soldiers fired three volleys of musketry--the wailing being

previously silenced to permit of the guns being heard.  His Highness

Prince William, in a showy military uniform (the "true prince," this--

scion of the house over-thrown by the present dynasty--he was formerly

betrothed to the Princess but was not allowed to marry her), stood guard

and paced back and forth within the door.  The privileged few who

followed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime, but the King

soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it.  A stranger

could have guessed his rank (although he was so simply and

unpretentiously dressed) by the profound deference paid him by all

persons in his vicinity; by seeing his high officers receive his quiet

orders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads; and by observing

how careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid

"crowding" him (although there was room enough in the doorway for a wagon

to pass, for that matter); how respectfully they edged out sideways,

scraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a front view

of their persons to his Majesty, and never putting their hats on until

they were well out of the royal presence.



He was dressed entirely in black--dress-coat and silk hat--and looked

rather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about him.  On his

breast he wore a large gold star, which was half hidden by the lapel of

his coat.  He remained at the door a half hour, and occasionally gave an

order to the men who were erecting the kahilis [Ranks of long-handled

mops made of gaudy feathers--sacred to royalty.  They are stuck in the

ground around the tomb and left there.]  before the tomb.  He had the

good taste to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary

hempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the frame-work with.

Finally he entered his carriage and drove away, and the populace shortly

began to drop into his wake.  While he was in view there was but one man

who attracted more attention than himself, and that was Harris (the

Yankee Prime Minister).  This feeble personage had crape enough around

his hat to express the grief of an entire nation, and as usual he

neglected no opportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the

admiration of the simple Kanakas.  Oh! noble ambition of this modern

Richelieu!



It is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the Princess

Victoria with those of her noted ancestor Kamehameha the Conqueror, who

died fifty years ago--in 1819, the year before the first missionaries

came.



      "On the 8th of May, 1819, at the age of sixty-six, he died, as he

      had lived, in the faith of his country.  It was his misfortune not

      to have come in contact with men who could have rightly influenced

      his religious aspirations.  Judged by his advantages and compared

      with the most eminent of his countrymen he may be justly styled not

      only great, but good.  To this day his memory warms the heart and

      elevates the national feelings of Hawaiians.  They are proud of

      their old warrior King; they love his name; his deeds form their

      historical age; and an enthusiasm everywhere prevails, shared even

      by foreigners who knew his worth, that constitutes the firmest

      pillar of the throne of his dynasty.



      "In lieu of human victims (the custom of that age), a sacrifice of

      three hundred dogs attended his obsequies--no mean holocaust when

      their national value and the estimation in which they were held are

      considered.  The bones of Kamehameha, after being kept for a while,

      were so carefully concealed that all knowledge of their final

      resting place is now lost.  There was a proverb current among the

      common people that the bones of a cruel King could not be hid; they

      made fish-hooks and arrows of them, upon which, in using them, they

      vented their abhorrence of his memory in bitter execrations."



The account of the circumstances of his death, as written by the native

historians, is full of minute detail, but there is scarcely a line of it

which does not mention or illustrate some by-gone custom of the country.

In this respect it is the most comprehensive document I have yet met

with.  I will quote it entire:



      "When Kamehameha was dangerously sick, and the priests were unable

      to cure him, they said: 'Be of good courage and build a house for

      the god' (his own private god or idol), that thou mayest recover.'

      The chiefs corroborated this advice of the priests, and a place of

      worship was prepared for Kukailimoku, and consecrated in the

      evening.  They proposed also to the King, with a view to prolong his

      life, that human victims should be sacrificed to his deity; upon

      which the greater part of the people absconded through fear of

      death, and concealed themselves in hiding places till the tabu [Tabu

      (pronounced tah-boo,) means prohibition (we have borrowed it,) or

      sacred.  The tabu was sometimes permanent, sometimes temporary; and

      the person or thing placed under tabu was for the time being sacred

      to the purpose for which it was set apart.  In the above case the

      victims selected under the tabu would be sacred to the sacrifice]

      in which destruction impended, was past.  It is doubtful whether

      Kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and priests to

      sacrifice men, as he was known to say, 'The men are sacred for the

      King;' meaning that they were for the service of his successor.

      This information was derived from Liholiho, his son.



      "After this, his sickness increased to such a degree that he had not

      strength to turn himself in his bed.  When another season,

      consecrated for worship at the new temple (heiau) arrived, he said

      to his son, Liholiho, 'Go thou and make supplication to thy god; I

      am not able to go, and will offer my prayers at home.'  When his

      devotions to his feathered god, Kukailimoku, were concluded, a

      certain religiously disposed individual, who had a bird god,

      suggested to the King that through its influence his sickness might

      be removed.  The name of this god was Pua; its body was made of a

      bird, now eaten by the Hawaiians, and called in their language alae.

      Kamehameha was willing that a trial should be made, and two houses

      were constructed to facilitate the experiment; but while dwelling in

      them he became so very weak as not to receive food.  After lying

      there three days, his wives, children and chiefs, perceiving that he

      was very low, returned him to his own house.  In the evening he was

      carried to the eating house,  where he took a little food in his

      mouth which he did not swallow; also a cup of water.  The chiefs

      requested him to give them his counsel; but he made no reply, and

      was carried back to the dwelling house; but when near midnight--ten

      o'clock, perhaps--he was carried again to the place to eat; but, as

      before, he merely tasted of what was presented to him.  Then

      Kaikioewa addressed him thus: 'Here we all are, your younger

      brethren, your son Liholiho and your foreigner; impart to us your

      dying charge, that Liholiho and Kaahumanu may hear.' Then Kamehameha

      inquired, 'What do you say?' Kaikioewa repeated, 'Your counsels for

      us.'



      "He then said, 'Move on in my good way and--.' He could proceed no

      further.  The foreigner, Mr. Young, embraced and kissed him.

      Hoapili also embraced him, whispering something in his ear, after

      which he was taken back to the house.  About twelve he was carried

      once more to the house for eating, into which his head entered,

      while his body was in the dwelling house immediately adjoining.  It

      should be remarked that this frequent carrying of a sick chief from

      one house to another resulted from the tabu system, then in force.

      There were at that time six houses (huts) connected with an

      establishment--one was for worship, one for the men to eat in, an

      eating house for the women, a house to sleep in, a house in which to

      manufacture kapa (native cloth) and one where, at certain intervals,

      the women might dwell in seclusion.



      "The sick was once more taken to his house, when he expired; this

      was at two o'clock, a circumstance from which Leleiohoku derived his

      name.  As he breathed his last, Kalaimoku came to the eating house

      to order those in it to go out.  There were two aged persons thus

      directed to depart; one went, the other remained on account of love

      to the King, by whom he had formerly been kindly sustained.  The

      children also were sent away.  Then Kalaimoku came to the house, and

      the chiefs had a consultation.  One of them spoke thus: 'This is my

      thought--we will eat him raw. [This sounds suspicious, in view of

      the fact that all Sandwich Island historians, white and black,

      protest that cannibalism never existed in the islands.  However,

      since they only proposed to "eat him raw" we "won't count that".

      But it would certainly have been cannibalism if they had cooked

      him.--M.  T.]  Kaahumanu (one of the dead King's widows) replied,

      'Perhaps his body is not at our disposal; that is more properly with

      his successor.  Our part in him--his breath--has departed; his

      remains will be disposed of by Liholiho.'



      "After this conversation the body was taken into the consecrated

      house for the performance of the proper rites by the priest and the

      new King.  The name of this ceremony is uko; and when the sacred hog

      was baked the priest offered it to the dead body, and it became a

      god, the King at the same time repeating the customary prayers.



      "Then the priest, addressing himself to the King and chiefs, said:

      'I will now make known to you the rules to be observed respecting

      persons to be sacrificed on the burial of this body.  If you obtain

      one man before the corpse is removed, one will be sufficient; but

      after it leaves this house four will be required.  If delayed until

      we carry the corpse to the grave there must be ten; but after it is

      deposited in the grave there must be fifteen.  To-morrow morning

      there will be a tabu, and, if the sacrifice be delayed until that

      time, forty men must die.'



      "Then the high priest, Hewahewa, inquired of the chiefs, 'Where

      shall be the residence of King Liholiho?'  They replied, 'Where,

      indeed?  You, of all men, ought to know.'  Then the priest observed,

      'There are two suitable places; one is Kau, the other is Kohala.'

      The chiefs preferred the latter, as it was more thickly inhabited.

      The priest added, 'These are proper places for the King's residence;

      but he must not remain in Kona, for it is polluted.'  This was

      agreed to.  It was now break of day.  As he was being carried to the

      place of burial the people perceived that their King was dead, and

      they wailed.  When the corpse was removed from the house to the

      tomb, a distance of one chain, the procession was met by a certain

      man who was ardently attached to the deceased.  He leaped upon the

      chiefs who were carrying the King's body; he desired to die with him

      on account of his love.  The chiefs drove him away.  He persisted in

      making numerous attempts, which were unavailing.  Kalaimoka also had

      it in his heart to die with him, but was prevented by Hookio.



      "The morning following Kamehameha's death, Liholiho and his train

      departed for Kohala, according to the suggestions of the priest, to

      avoid the defilement occasioned by the dead.  At this time if a

      chief died the land was polluted, and the heirs sought a residence

      in another part of the country until the corpse was dissected and

      the bones tied in a bundle, which being done, the season of

      defilement terminated.  If the deceased were not a chief, the house

      only was defiled which became pure again on the burial of the body.

      Such were the laws on this subject.



      "On the morning on which Liholiho sailed in his canoe for Kohala,

      the chiefs and people mourned after their manner on occasion of a

      chief's death, conducting themselves like madmen and like beasts.

      Their conduct was such as to forbid description; The priests, also,

      put into action the sorcery apparatus, that the person who had

      prayed the King to death might die; for it was not believed that

      Kamehameha's departure was the effect either of sickness or old age.

      When the sorcerers set up by their fire-places sticks with a strip

      of kapa flying at the top, the chief Keeaumoku, Kaahumaun's brother,

      came in a state of intoxication and broke the flag-staff of the

      sorcerers, from which it was inferred that Kaahumanu and her friends

      had been instrumental in the King's death.  On this account they

      were subjected to abuse."



You have the contrast, now, and a strange one it is.  This great Queen,

Kaahumanu, who was "subjected to abuse" during the frightful orgies that

followed the King's death, in accordance with ancient custom, afterward

became a devout Christian and a steadfast and powerful friend of the

missionaries.



Dogs were, and still are, reared and fattened for food, by the natives--

hence the reference to their value in one of the above paragraphs.



Forty years ago it was the custom in the Islands to suspend all law for a

certain number of days after the death of a royal personage; and then a

saturnalia ensued which one may picture to himself after a fashion, but

not in the full horror of the reality.  The people shaved their heads,

knocked out a tooth or two, plucked out an eye sometimes, cut, bruised,

mutilated or burned their flesh, got drunk, burned each other's huts,

maimed or murdered one another according to the caprice of the moment,

and both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbridled licentiousness.



And after it all, came a torpor from which the nation slowly emerged

bewildered and dazed, as if from a hideous half-remembered nightmare.

They were not the salt of the earth, those "gentle children of the sun."



The natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which cannot be

comforting to an invalid.  When they think a sick friend is going to die,

a couple of dozen neighbors surround his hut and keep up a deafening

wailing night and day till he either dies or gets well.  No doubt this

arrangement has helped many a subject to a shroud before his appointed

time.



They surround a hut and wail in the same heart-broken way when its

occupant returns from a journey.  This is their dismal idea of a welcome.

A very little of it would go a great way with most of us.









CHAPTER LXIX.



Bound for Hawaii (a hundred and fifty miles distant,) to visit the great

volcano and behold the other notable things which distinguish that island

above the remainder of the group, we sailed from Honolulu on a certain

Saturday afternoon, in the good schooner Boomerang.



The Boomerang was about as long as two street cars, and about as wide as

one.  She was so small (though she was larger than the majority of the

inter-island coasters) that when I stood on her deck I felt but little

smaller than the Colossus of Rhodes must have felt when he had a man-of-

war under him.  I could reach the water when she lay over under a strong

breeze.  When the Captain and my comrade (a Mr. Billings), myself and

four other persons were all assembled on the little after portion of the

deck which is sacred to the cabin passengers, it was full--there was not

room for any more quality folks.  Another section of the deck, twice as

large as ours, was full of natives of both sexes, with their customary

dogs, mats, blankets, pipes, calabashes of poi, fleas, and other luxuries

and baggage of minor importance.  As soon as we set sail the natives all

lay down on the deck as thick as negroes in a slave-pen, and smoked,

conversed, and spit on each other, and were truly sociable.



The little low-ceiled cabin below was rather larger than a hearse, and as

dark as a vault.  It had two coffins on each side--I mean two bunks.

A small table, capable of accommodating three persons at dinner, stood

against the forward bulkhead, and over it hung the dingiest whale oil

lantern that ever peopled the obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly shapes.

The floor room unoccupied was not extensive.  One might swing a cat in

it, perhaps, but not a long cat.  The hold forward of the bulkhead had

but little freight in it, and from morning till night a portly old

rooster, with a voice like Baalam's ass, and the same disposition to use

it, strutted up and down in that part of the vessel and crowed.  He

usually took dinner at six o'clock, and then, after an hour devoted to

meditation, he mounted a barrel and crowed a good part of the night.

He got hoarser all the time, but he scorned to allow any personal

consideration to interfere with his duty, and kept up his labors in

defiance of threatened diphtheria.



Sleeping was out of the question when he was on watch.  He was a source

of genuine aggravation and annoyance.  It was worse than useless to shout

at him or apply offensive epithets to him--he only took these things for

applause, and strained himself to make more noise.  Occasionally, during

the day, I threw potatoes at him through an aperture in the bulkhead, but

he only dodged and went on crowing.



The first night, as I lay in my coffin, idly watching the dim lamp

swinging to the rolling of the ship, and snuffing the nauseous odors of

bilge water, I felt something gallop over me.  I turned out promptly.

However, I turned in again when I found it was only a rat.  Presently

something galloped over me once more.  I knew it was not a rat this time,

and I thought it might be a centipede, because the Captain had killed one

on deck in the afternoon.  I turned out.  The first glance at the pillow

showed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of it--cockroaches as

large as peach leaves--fellows with long, quivering antennae and fiery,

malignant eyes.  They were grating their teeth like tobacco worms, and

appeared to be dissatisfied about something.  I had often heard that

these reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping sailors' toe

nails down to the quick, and I would not get in the bunk any more.  I lay

down on the floor.  But a rat came and bothered me, and shortly afterward

a procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair.  In a few

moments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas

were throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest disorder,

and taking a bite every time they struck.  I was beginning to feel really

annoyed.  I got up and put my clothes on and went on deck.



The above is not overdrawn; it is a truthful sketch of inter-island

schooner life.  There is no such thing as keeping a vessel in elegant

condition, when she carries molasses and Kanakas.



It was compensation for my sufferings to come unexpectedly upon so

beautiful a scene as met my eye--to step suddenly out of the sepulchral

gloom of the cabin and stand under the strong light of the moon--in the

centre, as it were, of a glittering sea of liquid silver--to see the

broad sails straining in the gale, the ship heeled over on her side, the

angry foam hissing past her lee bulwarks, and sparkling sheets of spray

dashing high over her bows and raining upon her decks; to brace myself

and hang fast to the first object that presented itself, with hat jammed

down and coat tails whipping in the breeze, and feel that exhilaration

that thrills in one's hair and quivers down his back bone when he knows

that every inch of canvas is drawing and the vessel cleaving through the

waves at her utmost speed.  There was no darkness, no dimness, no

obscurity there.  All was brightness, every object was vividly defined.

Every prostrate Kanaka; every coil of rope; every calabash of poi; every

puppy; every seam in the flooring; every bolthead; every object; however

minute, showed sharp and distinct in its every outline; and the shadow of

the broad mainsail lay black as a pall upon the deck, leaving Billings's

white upturned face glorified and his body in a total eclipse.

Monday morning we were close to the island of Hawaii.  Two of its high

mountains were in view--Mauna Loa and Hualaiai.



The latter is an imposing peak, but being only ten thousand feet high is

seldom mentioned or heard of.  Mauna Loa is said to be sixteen thousand

feet high.  The rays of glittering snow and ice, that clasped its summit

like a claw, looked refreshing when viewed from the blistering climate we

were in.  One could stand on that mountain (wrapped up in blankets and

furs to keep warm), and while he nibbled a snowball or an icicle to

quench his thirst he could look down the long sweep of its sides and see

spots where plants are growing that grow only where the bitter cold of

Winter prevails; lower down he could see sections devoted to production

that thrive in the temperate zone alone; and at the bottom of the

mountain he could see the home of the tufted cocoa-palms and other

species of vegetation that grow only in the sultry atmosphere of eternal

Summer.  He could see all the climes of the world at a single glance of

the eye, and that glance would only pass over a distance of four or five

miles as the bird flies!



By and by we took boat and went ashore at Kailua, designing to ride

horseback through the pleasant orange and coffee region of Kona, and

rejoin the vessel at a point some leagues distant.  This journey is well

worth taking.  The trail passes along on high ground--say a thousand feet

above sea level--and usually about a mile distant from the ocean, which

is always in sight, save that occasionally you find yourself buried in

the forest in the midst of a rank tropical vegetation and a dense growth

of trees, whose great bows overarch the road and shut out sun and sea and

everything, and leave you in a dim, shady tunnel, haunted with invisible

singing birds and fragrant with the odor of flowers.  It was pleasant to

ride occasionally in the warm sun, and feast the eye upon the ever-

changing panorama of the forest (beyond and below us), with its many

tints, its softened lights and shadows, its billowy undulations sweeping

gently down from the mountain to the sea.  It was pleasant also, at

intervals, to leave the sultry sun and pass into the cool, green depths

of this forest and indulge in sentimental reflections under the

inspiration of its brooding twilight and its whispering foliage.

We rode through one orange grove that had ten thousand tree in it!

They were all laden with fruit.



At one farmhouse we got some large peaches of excellent flavor.

This fruit, as a general thing, does not do well in the Sandwich Islands.

It takes a sort of almond shape, and is small and bitter.  It needs

frost, they say, and perhaps it does; if this be so, it will have a good

opportunity to go on needing it, as it will not be likely to get it.

The trees from which the fine fruit I have spoken of, came, had been

planted and replanted sixteen times, and to this treatment the proprietor

of the orchard attributed his-success.



We passed several sugar plantations--new ones and not very extensive.

The crops were, in most cases, third rattoons.  [NOTE.--The first crop is

called "plant cane;" subsequent crops which spring from the original

roots, without replanting, are called "rattoons."] Almost everywhere on

the island of Hawaii sugar-cane matures in twelve months, both rattoons

and plant, and although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels,

no doubt, it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four months

afterward.  In Kona, the average yield of an acre of ground is two tons

of sugar, they say.  This is only a moderate yield for these islands, but

would be astounding for Louisiana and most other sugar growing countries.

The plantations in Kona being on pretty high ground--up among the light

and frequent rains--no irrigation whatever is required.









CHAPTER LXX.



We stopped some time at one of the plantations, to rest ourselves and

refresh the horses.  We had a chatty conversation with several gentlemen

present; but there was one person, a middle aged man, with an absent look

in his face, who simply glanced up, gave us good-day and lapsed again

into the meditations which our coming had interrupted.  The planters

whispered us not to mind him--crazy.  They said he was in the Islands for

his health; was a preacher; his home, Michigan.  They said that if he

woke up presently and fell to talking about a correspondence which he had

some time held with Mr. Greeley about a trifle of some kind, we must

humor him and listen with interest; and we must humor his fancy that this

correspondence was the talk of the world.



It was easy to see that he was a gentle creature and that his madness had

nothing vicious in it.  He looked pale, and a little worn, as if with

perplexing thought and anxiety of mind.  He sat a long time, looking at

the floor, and at intervals muttering to himself and nodding his head

acquiescingly or shaking it in mild protest.  He was lost in his thought,

or in his memories.  We continued our talk with the planters, branching

from subject to subject.  But at last the word "circumstance," casually

dropped, in the course of conversation, attracted his attention and

brought an eager look into his countenance.  He faced about in his chair

and said:



"Circumstance?  What circumstance?  Ah, I know--I know too well.  So you

have heard of it too."  [With a sigh.] "Well, no matter--all the world

has heard of it.  All the world.  The whole world.  It is a large world,

too, for a thing to travel so far in--now isn't it?  Yes, yes--the

Greeley correspondence with Erickson has created the saddest and

bitterest controversy on both sides of the ocean--and still they keep it

up!  It makes us famous, but at what a sorrowful sacrifice!  I was so

sorry when I heard that it had caused that bloody and distressful war

over there in Italy.  It was little comfort to me, after so much

bloodshed, to know that the victors sided with me, and the vanquished

with Greeley.--It is little comfort to know that Horace Greeley is

responsible for the battle of Sadowa, and not me.



"Queen Victoria wrote me that she felt just as I did about it--she said

that as much as she was opposed to Greeley and the spirit he showed in

the correspondence with me, she would not have had Sadowa happen for

hundreds of dollars.  I can show you her letter, if you would like to see

it.  But gentlemen, much as you may think you know about that unhappy

correspondence, you cannot know the straight of it till you hear it from

my lips.  It has always been garbled in the journals, and even in

history.  Yes, even in history--think of it!  Let me--please let me, give

you the matter, exactly as it occurred.  I truly will not abuse your

confidence."



Then he leaned forward, all interest, all earnestness, and told his

story--and told it appealingly, too, and yet in the simplest and most

unpretentious way; indeed, in such a way as to suggest to one, all the

time, that this was a faithful, honorable witness, giving evidence in the

sacred interest of justice, and under oath.  He said:



"Mrs. Beazeley--Mrs. Jackson Beazeley, widow, of the village of

Campbellton, Kansas,--wrote me about a matter which was near her heart

--a matter which many might think trivial, but to her it was a thing of

deep concern.  I was living in Michigan, then--serving in the ministry.

She was, and is, an estimable woman--a woman to whom poverty and hardship

have proven incentives to industry, in place of discouragements.

Her only treasure was her son William, a youth just verging upon manhood;

religious, amiable, and sincerely attached to agriculture.  He was the

widow's comfort and her pride.  And so, moved by her love for him, she

wrote me about a matter, as I have said before, which lay near her heart

--because it lay near her boy's.  She desired me to confer with

Mr. Greeley about turnips.  Turnips were the dream of her child's young

ambition.  While other youths were frittering away in frivolous

amusements the precious years of budding vigor which God had given them

for useful preparation, this boy was patiently enriching his mind with

information concerning turnips.  The sentiment which he felt toward the

turnip was akin to adoration.  He could not think of the turnip without

emotion; he could not speak of it calmly; he could not contemplate it

without exaltation.  He could not eat it without shedding tears.  All the

poetry in his sensitive nature was in sympathy with the gracious

vegetable.  With the earliest pipe of dawn he sought his patch, and when

the curtaining night drove him from it he shut himself up with his books

and garnered statistics till sleep overcame him.  On rainy days he sat

and talked hours together with his mother about turnips.  When company

came, he made it his loving duty to put aside everything else and

converse with them all the day long of his great joy in the turnip.



"And yet, was this joy rounded and complete?  Was there no secret alloy of

unhappiness in it?  Alas, there was.  There was a canker gnawing at his

heart; the noblest inspiration of his soul eluded his endeavor--viz: he

could not make of the turnip a climbing vine.  Months went by; the bloom

forsook his cheek, the fire faded out of his eye; sighings and

abstraction usurped the place of smiles and cheerful converse.  But a

watchful eye noted these things and in time a motherly sympathy unsealed

the secret.  Hence the letter to me.  She pleaded for attention--she said

her boy was dying by inches.



"I was a stranger to Mr. Greeley, but what of that?  The matter was

urgent.  I wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem if

possible and save the student's life.  My interest grew, until it partook

of the anxiety of the mother.  I waited in much suspense.--At last the

answer came.



"I found that I could not read it readily, the handwriting being

unfamiliar and my emotions somewhat wrought up.  It seemed to refer in

part to the boy's case, but chiefly to other and irrelevant matters--such

as paving-stones, electricity, oysters, and something which I took to be

'absolution' or 'agrarianism,' I could not be certain which; still, these

appeared to be simply casual mentions, nothing more; friendly in spirit,

without doubt, but lacking the connection or coherence necessary to make

them useful.--I judged that my understanding was affected by my feelings,

and so laid the letter away till morning.



"In the morning I read it again, but with difficulty and uncertainty

still, for I had lost some little rest and my mental vision seemed

clouded.  The note was more connected, now, but did not meet the

emergency it was expected to meet.  It was too discursive.  It appeared

to read as follows, though I was not certain of some of the words:



      "Polygamy dissembles majesty; extracts redeem polarity; causes

      hitherto exist.  Ovations pursue wisdom, or warts inherit and

      condemn.  Boston, botany, cakes, folony undertakes, but who shall

      allay?  We fear not.  Yrxwly,

                               HEVACE EVEELOJ.'



"But there did not seem to be a word about turnips.  There seemed to be

no suggestion as to how they might be made to grow like vines.  There was

not even a reference to the Beazeleys.  I slept upon the matter; I ate no

supper, neither any breakfast next morning.  So I resumed my work with a

brain refreshed, and was very hopeful.  Now the letter took a different

aspect-all save the signature, which latter I judged to be only a

harmless affectation of Hebrew.  The epistle was necessarily from Mr.

Greeley, for it bore the printed heading of The Tribune, and I had

written to no one else there.  The letter, I say, had taken a different

aspect, but still its language was eccentric and avoided the issue.  It

now appeared to say:



      "Bolivia extemporizes mackerel; borax esteems polygamy; sausages

      wither in the east.  Creation perdu, is done; for woes inherent one

      can damn.  Buttons, buttons, corks, geology underrates but we shall

      allay.  My beer's out.  Yrxwly,

                                         HEVACE EVEELOJ.'



"I was evidently overworked.  My comprehension was impaired.  Therefore I

gave two days to recreation, and then returned to my task greatly

refreshed.  The letter now took this form:



      "Poultices do sometimes choke swine; tulips reduce posterity; causes

      leather to resist.  Our notions empower wisdom, her let's afford

      while we can.  Butter but any cakes, fill any undertaker, we'll wean

      him from his filly.  We feel hot.

                                    Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.'



"I was still not satisfied.  These generalities did not meet the

question.  They were crisp, and vigorous, and delivered with a confidence

that almost compelled conviction; but at such a time as this, with a

human life at stake, they seemed inappropriate, worldly, and in bad

taste.  At any other time I would have been not only glad, but proud, to

receive from a man like Mr. Greeley a letter of this kind, and would have

studied it earnestly and tried to improve myself all I could; but now,

with that poor boy in his far home languishing for relief, I had no heart

for learning.



"Three days passed by, and I read the note again.  Again its tenor had

changed.  It now appeared to say:



      "Potations do sometimes wake wines; turnips restrain passion; causes

      necessary to state.  Infest the poor widow; her lord's effects will

      be void.  But dirt, bathing, etc., etc., followed unfairly, will

      worm him from his folly--so swear not.

                                              Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.'



"This was more like it.  But I was unable to proceed.  I was too much

worn.  The word 'turnips' brought temporary joy and encouragement, but my

strength was so much impaired, and the delay might be so perilous for the

boy, that I relinquished the idea of pursuing the translation further,

and resolved to do what I ought to have done at first.  I sat down and

wrote Mr. Greeley as follows:



      "DEAR SIR: I fear I do not entirely comprehend your kind note.  It

      cannot be possible, Sir, that 'turnips restrain passion'--at least

      the study or contemplation of turnips cannot--for it is this very

      employment that has scorched our poor friend's mind and sapped his

      bodily strength.--But if they do restrain it, will you bear with us

      a little further and explain how they should be prepared?  I observe

      that you say 'causes necessary to state,' but you have omitted to

      state them.



      "Under a misapprehension, you seem to attribute to me interested

      motives in this matter--to call it by no harsher term.  But I assure

      you, dear sir, that if I seem to be 'infesting the widow,' it is all

      seeming, and void of reality.  It is from no seeking of mine that I

      am in this position.  She asked me, herself, to write you.  I never

      have infested her--indeed I scarcely know her.  I do not infest

      anybody.  I try to go along, in my humble way, doing as near right

      as I can, never harming anybody, and never throwing out

      insinuations.  As for 'her lord and his effects,' they are of no

      interest to me.  I trust I have effects enough of my own--shall

      endeavor to get along with them, at any rate, and not go mousing

      around to get hold of somebody's that are 'void.'  But do you not

      see?--this woman is a widow--she has no 'lord.'  He is dead--or

      pretended to be, when they buried him.  Therefore, no amount of

      'dirt, bathing,' etc., etc., howsoever 'unfairly followed' will be

      likely to 'worm him from his folly'--if being dead and a ghost is

      'folly.'  Your closing remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for;

      and if report says true you might have applied it to yourself, sir,

      with more point and less impropriety.

                               Very Truly Yours, SIMON ERICKSON.



"In the course of a few days, Mr. Greely did what would have saved a

world of trouble, and much mental and bodily suffering and

misunderstanding, if he had done it sooner.  To wit, he sent an

intelligible rescript or translation of his original note, made in a

plain hand by his clerk.  Then the mystery cleared, and I saw that his

heart had been right, all the time.  I will recite the note in its

clarified form:



      [Translation.]

      'Potatoes do sometimes make vines; turnips remain passive: cause

      unnecessary to state.  Inform the poor widow her lad's efforts will

      be vain.  But diet, bathing, etc.  etc., followed uniformly, will

      wean him from his folly--so fear not.

                                         Yours, HORACE GREELEY.'



"But alas, it was too late, gentlemen--too late.  The criminal delay had

done its work--young Beazely was no more.  His spirit had taken its

flight to a land where all anxieties shall be charmed away, all desires

gratified, all ambitions realized.  Poor lad, they laid him to his rest

with a turnip in each hand."



So ended Erickson, and lapsed again into nodding, mumbling, and

abstraction.  The company broke up, and left him so....  But they did not

say what drove him crazy.  In the momentary confusion, I forgot to ask.









CHAPTER LXXI.



At four o'clock in the afternoon we were winding down a mountain of

dreary and desolate lava to the sea, and closing our pleasant land

journey.  This lava is the accumulation of ages; one torrent of fire

after another has rolled down here in old times, and built up the island

structure higher and higher.  Underneath, it is honey-combed with caves;

it would be of no use to dig wells in such a place; they would not hold

water--you would not find any for them to hold, for that matter.

Consequently, the planters depend upon cisterns.



The last lava flow occurred here so long ago that there are none now

living who witnessed it.  In one place it enclosed and burned down a

grove of cocoa-nut trees, and the holes in the lava where the trunks

stood are still visible; their sides retain the impression of the bark;

the trees fell upon the burning river, and becoming partly submerged,

left in it the perfect counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf,

and even nut, for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon

and wonder at.



There were doubtless plenty of Kanaka sentinels on guard hereabouts at

that time, but they did not leave casts of their figures in the lava as

the Roman sentinels at Herculaneum and Pompeii did.  It is a pity it is

so, because such things are so interesting; but so it is.  They probably

went away.  They went away early, perhaps.  However, they had their

merits; the Romans exhibited the higher pluck, but the Kanakas showed the

sounder judgment.



Shortly we came in sight of that spot whose history is so familiar to

every school-boy in the wide world--Kealakekua Bay--the place where

Captain Cook, the great circumnavigator, was killed by the natives,

nearly a hundred years ago.  The setting sun was flaming upon it, a

Summer shower was falling, and it was spanned by two magnificent

rainbows.  Two men who were in advance of us rode through one of these

and for a moment their garments shone with a more than regal splendor.

Why did not Captain Cook have taste enough to call his great discovery

the Rainbow Islands?  These charming spectacles are present to you at

every turn; they are common in all the islands; they are visible every

day, and frequently at night also--not the silvery bow we see once in an

age in the States, by moonlight, but barred with all bright and beautiful

colors, like the children of the sun and rain.  I saw one of them a few

nights ago.  What the sailors call "raindogs"--little patches of rainbow

--are often seen drifting about the heavens in these latitudes, like

stained cathedral windows.



Kealakekua Bay is a little curve like the last kink of a snail-shell,

winding deep into the land, seemingly not more than a mile wide from

shore to shore.  It is bounded on one side--where the murder was done--by

a little flat plain, on which stands a cocoanut grove and some ruined

houses; a steep wall of lava, a thousand feet high at the upper end and

three or four hundred at the lower, comes down from the mountain and

bounds the inner extremity of it.  From this wall the place takes its

name, Kealakekua, which in the native tongue signifies "The Pathway of

the Gods."  They say, (and still believe, in spite of their liberal

education in Christianity), that the great god Lono, who used to live

upon the hillside, always traveled that causeway when urgent business

connected with heavenly affairs called him down to the seashore in a

hurry.



As the red sun looked across the placid ocean through the tall, clean

stems of the cocoanut trees, like a blooming whiskey bloat through the

bars of a city prison, I went and stood in the edge of the water on the

flat rock pressed by Captain Cook's feet when the blow was dealt which

took away his life, and tried to picture in my mind the doomed man

struggling in the midst of the multitude of exasperated savages--the men

in the ship crowding to the vessel's side and gazing in anxious dismay

toward the shore--the--but I discovered that I could not do it.



It was growing dark, the rain began to fall, we could see that the

distant Boomerang was helplessly becalmed at sea, and so I adjourned to

the cheerless little box of a warehouse and sat down to smoke and think,

and wish the ship would make the land--for we had not eaten much for ten

hours and were viciously hungry.



Plain unvarnished history takes the romance out of Captain Cook's

assassination, and renders a deliberate verdict of justifiable homicide.

Wherever he went among the islands, he was cordially received and

welcomed by the inhabitants, and his ships lavishly supplied with all

manner of food.  He returned these kindnesses with insult and ill-

treatment.  Perceiving that the people took him for the long vanished and

lamented god Lono, he encouraged them in the delusion for the sake of the

limitless power it gave him; but during the famous disturbance at this

spot, and while he and his comrades were surrounded by fifteen thousand

maddened savages, he received a hurt and betrayed his earthly origin with

a groan.  It was his death-warrant.  Instantly a shout went up: "He

groans!--he is not a god!" So they closed in upon him and dispatched him.



His flesh was stripped from the bones and burned (except nine pounds of

it which were sent on board the ships).  The heart was hung up in a

native hut, where it was found and eaten by three children, who mistook

it for the heart of a dog.  One of these children grew to be a very old

man, and died in Honolulu a few years ago.  Some of Cook's bones were

recovered and consigned to the deep by the officers of the ships.



Small blame should attach to the natives for the killing of Cook.

They treated him well.  In return, he abused them.  He and his men

inflicted bodily injury upon many of them at different times, and killed

at least three of them before they offered any proportionate retaliation.



Near the shore we found "Cook's Monument"--only a cocoanut stump, four

feet high and about a foot in diameter at the butt.  It had lava boulders

piled around its base to hold it up and keep it in its place, and it was

entirely sheathed over, from top to bottom, with rough, discolored sheets

of copper, such as ships' bottoms are coppered with.  Each sheet had a

rude inscription scratched upon it--with a nail, apparently--and in every

case the execution was wretched.  Most of these merely recorded the

visits of British naval commanders to the spot, but one of them bore this

legend:



     "Near this spot fell

      CAPTAIN JAMES COOK,

      The Distinguished Circumnavigator,

      Who Discovered these Islands

      A. D.  1778."



After Cook's murder, his second in command, on board the ship, opened

fire upon the swarms of natives on the beach, and one of his cannon balls

cut this cocoanut tree short off and left this monumental stump standing.

It looked sad and lonely enough to us, out there in the rainy twilight.

But there is no other monument to Captain Cook.  True, up on the mountain

side we had passed by a large inclosure like an ample hog-pen, built of

lava blocks, which marks the spot where Cook's flesh was stripped from

his bones and burned; but this is not properly a monument since it was

erected by the natives themselves, and less to do honor to the

circumnavigator than for the sake of convenience in roasting him.

A thing like a guide-board was elevated above this pen on a tall pole,

and formerly there was an inscription upon it describing the memorable

occurrence that had there taken place; but the sun and the wind have long

ago so defaced it as to render it illegible.



Toward midnight a fine breeze sprang up and the schooner soon worked

herself into the bay and cast anchor.  The boat came ashore for us, and

in a little while the clouds and the rain were all gone.  The moon was

beaming tranquilly down on land and sea, and we two were stretched upon

the deck sleeping the refreshing sleep and dreaming the happy dreams that

are only vouchsafed to the weary and the innocent.









CHAPTER LXXII.



In the breezy morning we went ashore and visited the ruined temple of the

last god Lono.  The high chief cook of this temple--the priest who

presided over it and roasted the human sacrifices--was uncle to Obookia,

and at one time that youth was an apprentice-priest under him.  Obookia

was a young native of fine mind, who, together with three other native

boys, was taken to New England by the captain of a whaleship during the

reign of Kamehameha I, and they were the means of attracting the

attention of the religious world to their country.  This resulted in the

sending of missionaries there.  And this Obookia was the very same

sensitive savage who sat down on the church steps and wept because his

people did not have the Bible.  That incident has been very elaborately

painted in many a charming Sunday School book--aye, and told so

plaintively and so tenderly that I have cried over it in Sunday School

myself, on general principles, although at a time when I did not know

much and could not understand why the people of the Sandwich Islands

needed to worry so much about it as long as they did not know there was a

Bible at all.



Obookia was converted and educated, and was to have returned to his

native land with the first missionaries, had he lived.  The other native

youths made the voyage, and two of them did good service, but the third,

William Kanui, fell from grace afterward, for a time, and when the gold

excitement broke out in California he journeyed thither and went to

mining, although he was fifty years old.  He succeeded pretty well, but

the failure of Page, Bacon & Co. relieved him of six thousand dollars,

and then, to all intents and purposes, he was a bankrupt in his old age

and he resumed service in the pulpit again.  He died in Honolulu in 1864.



Quite a broad tract of land near the temple, extending from the sea to

the mountain top, was sacred to the god Lono in olden times--so sacred

that if a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it it was

judicious for him to make his will, because his time had come.  He might

go around it by water, but he could not cross it.  It was well sprinkled

with pagan temples and stocked with awkward, homely idols carved out of

logs of wood.  There was a temple devoted to prayers for rain--and with

fine sagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side

that if you prayed there twenty-four times a day for rain you would be

likely to get it every time.  You would seldom get to your Amen before

you would have to hoist your umbrella.



And there was a large temple near at hand which was built in a single

night, in the midst of storm and thunder and rain, by the ghastly hands

of dead men!  Tradition says that by the weird glare of the lightning a

noiseless multitude of phantoms were seen at their strange labor far up

the mountain side at dead of night--flitting hither and thither and

bearing great lava-blocks clasped in their nerveless fingers--appearing

and disappearing as the pallid lustre fell upon their forms and faded

away again.  Even to this day, it is said, the natives hold this dread

structure in awe and reverence, and will not pass by it in the night.



At noon I observed a bevy of nude native young ladies bathing in the sea,

and went and sat down on their clothes to keep them from being stolen.

I begged them to come out, for the sea was rising and I was satisfied

that they were running some risk.  But they were not afraid, and

presently went on with their sport.  They were finished swimmers and

divers, and enjoyed themselves to the last degree.



They swam races, splashed and ducked and tumbled each other about, and

filled the air with their laughter.  It is said that the first thing an

Islander learns is how to swim; learning to walk being a matter of

smaller consequence, comes afterward.  One hears tales of native men and

women swimming ashore from vessels many miles at sea--more miles, indeed,

than I dare vouch for or even mention.  And they tell of a native diver

who went down in thirty or forty-foot waters and brought up an anvil!

I think he swallowed the anvil afterward, if my memory serves me.

However I will not urge this point.



I have spoken, several times, of the god Lono--I may as well furnish two

or three sentences concerning him.



The idol the natives worshipped for him was a slender, unornamented staff

twelve feet long.  Tradition says he was a favorite god on the Island of

Hawaii--a great king who had been deified for meritorious services--just

our own fashion of rewarding heroes, with the difference that we would

have made him a Postmaster instead of a god, no doubt.  In an angry

moment he slew his wife, a goddess named Kaikilani Aiii.  Remorse of

conscience drove him mad, and tradition presents us the singular

spectacle of a god traveling "on the shoulder;" for in his gnawing grief

he wandered about from place to place boxing and wrestling with all whom

he met.  Of course this pastime soon lost its novelty, inasmuch as it

must necessarily have been the case that when so powerful a deity sent a

frail human opponent "to grass" he never came back any more.  Therefore,

he instituted games called makahiki, and ordered that they should be held

in his honor, and then sailed for foreign lands on a three-cornered raft,

stating that he would return some day--and that was the last of Lono.

He was never seen any more; his raft got swamped, perhaps.  But the

people always expected his return, and thus they were easily led to

accept Captain Cook as the restored god.



Some of the old natives believed Cook was Lono to the day of their death;

but many did not, for they could not understand how he could die if he

was a god.



Only a mile or so from Kealakekua Bay is a spot of historic interest--the

place where the last battle was fought for idolatry.  Of course we

visited it, and came away as wise as most people do who go and gaze upon

such mementoes of the past when in an unreflective mood.



While the first missionaries were on their way around the Horn, the

idolatrous customs which had obtained in the island, as far back as

tradition reached were suddenly broken up.  Old Kamehameha I., was dead,

and his son, Liholiho, the new King was a free liver, a roystering,

dissolute fellow, and hated the restraints of the ancient tabu.  His

assistant in the Government, Kaahumanu, the Queen dowager, was proud and

high-spirited, and hated the tabu because it restricted the privileges of

her sex and degraded all women very nearly to the level of brutes.

So the case stood.  Liholiho had half a mind to put his foot down,

Kaahumahu had a whole mind to badger him into doing it, and whiskey did

the rest.  It was probably the rest.  It was probably the first time

whiskey ever prominently figured as an aid to civilization.  Liholiho

came up to Kailua as drunk as a piper, and attended a great feast; the

determined Queen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch, and

then, while all the multitude stared in blank dismay, he moved

deliberately forward and sat down with the women!



They saw him eat from the same vessel with them, and were appalled!

Terrible moments drifted slowly by, and still the King ate, still he

lived, still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld!

Then conviction came like a revelation--the superstitions of a hundred

generations passed from before the people like a cloud, and a shout went

up, "the tabu is broken!  the tabu is broken!"



Thus did King Liholiho and his dreadful whiskey preach the first sermon

and prepare the way for the new gospel that was speeding southward over

the waves of the Atlantic.



The tabu broken and destruction failing to follow the awful sacrilege,

the people, with that childlike precipitancy which has always

characterized them, jumped to the conclusion that their gods were a weak

and wretched swindle, just as they formerly jumped to the conclusion that

Captain Cook was no god, merely because he groaned, and promptly killed

him without stopping to inquire whether a god might not groan as well as

a man if it suited his convenience to do it; and satisfied that the idols

were powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once and pulled

them down--hacked them to pieces--applied the torch--annihilated them!



The pagan priests were furious.  And well they might be; they had held

the fattest offices in the land, and now they were beggared; they had

been great--they had stood above the chiefs--and now they were vagabonds.

They raised a revolt; they scared a number of people into joining their

standard, and Bekuokalani, an ambitious offshoot of royalty, was easily

persuaded to become their leader.



In the first skirmish the idolaters triumphed over the royal army sent

against them, and full of confidence they resolved to march upon Kailua.

The King sent an envoy to try and conciliate them, and came very near

being an envoy short by the operation; the savages not only refused to

listen to him, but wanted to kill him.  So the King sent his men forth

under Major General Kalaimoku and the two host met a Kuamoo.  The battle

was long and fierce--men and women fighting side by side, as was the

custom--and when the day was done the rebels were flying in every

direction in hopeless panic, and idolatry and the tabu were dead in the

land!



The royalists marched gayly home to Kailua glorifying the new

dispensation.  "There is no power in the gods," said they; "they are a

vanity and a lie.  The army with idols was weak; the army without idols

was strong and victorious!"



The nation was without a religion.



The missionary ship arrived in safety shortly afterward, timed by

providential exactness to meet the emergency, and the Gospel was planted

as in a virgin soil.









CHAPTER LXXIII.



At noon, we hired a Kanaka to take us down to the ancient ruins at

Honaunan in his canoe--price two dollars--reasonable enough, for a sea

voyage of eight miles, counting both ways.



The native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance.  I cannot think

of anything to liken it to but a boy's sled runner hollowed out, and that

does not quite convey the correct idea.  It is about fifteen feet long,

high and pointed at both ends, is a foot and a half or two feet deep, and

so narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out

again.  It sits on top of the water like a duck, but it has an outrigger

and does not upset easily, if you keep still.  This outrigger is formed

of two long bent sticks like plow handles, which project from one side,

and to their outer ends is bound a curved beam composed of an extremely

light wood, which skims along the surface of the water and thus saves you

from an upset on that side, while the outrigger's weight is not so easily

lifted as to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly

feared.  Still, until one gets used to sitting perched upon this

knifeblade, he is apt to reason within himself that it would be more

comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other side also.

I had the bow seat, and Billings sat amidships and faced the Kanaka, who

occupied the stern of the craft and did the paddling.  With the first

stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from the shore like an arrow.

There was not much to see.  While we were on the shallow water of the

reef, it was pastime to look down into the limpid depths at the large

bunches of branching coral--the unique shrubbery of the sea.  We lost

that, though, when we got out into the dead blue water of the deep.  But

we had the picture of the surf, then, dashing angrily against the crag-

bound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the air.



There was interest in this beetling border, too, for it was honey-combed

with quaint caves and arches and tunnels, and had a rude semblance of the

dilapidated architecture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of the

restless sea.  When this novelty ceased to be a novelty, we turned our

eyes shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green forests

stretching up into the curtaining clouds, and at the specks of houses in

the rearward distance and the diminished schooner riding sleepily at

anchor.  And when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into the midst of

a school of huge, beastly porpoises engaged at their eternal game of

arching over a wave and disappearing, and then doing it over again and

keeping it up--always circling over, in that way, like so many well-

submerged wheels.  But the porpoises wheeled themselves away, and then we

were thrown upon our own resources.  It did not take many minutes to

discover that the sun was blazing like a bonfire, and that the weather

was of a melting temperature.  It had a drowsing effect, too.

In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes

and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-

bathing.  Each heathen would paddle three or four hundred yards out to

sea, (taking a short board with him), then face the shore and wait for a

particularly prodigious billow to come along; at the right moment he

would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board,

and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell!  It did not seem

that a lightning express train could shoot along at a more hair-lifting

speed.  I tried surf-bathing once, subsequently, but made a failure of

it.  I got the board placed right, and at the right moment, too; but

missed the connection myself.--The board struck the shore in three

quarters of a second, without any cargo, and I struck the bottom about

the same time, with a couple of barrels of water in me.  None but natives

ever master the art of surf-bathing thoroughly.



At the end of an hour, we had made the four miles, and landed on a level

point of land, upon which was a wide extent of old ruins, with many a

tall cocoanut tree growing among them.  Here was the ancient City of

Refuge--a vast inclosure, whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the

base, and fifteen feet high; an oblong square, a thousand and forty feet

one way and a fraction under seven hundred the other.  Within this

inclosure, in early times, has been three rude temples; each two hundred

and ten feet long by one hundred wide, and thirteen high.



In those days, if a man killed another anywhere on the island the

relatives were privileged to take the murderer's life; and then a chase

for life and liberty began--the outlawed criminal flying through pathless

forests and over mountain and plain, with his hopes fixed upon the

protecting walls of the City of Refuge, and the avenger of blood

following hotly after him!



Sometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the temple, and the

panting pair sped through long files of excited natives, who watched the

contest with flashing eye and dilated nostril, encouraging the hunted

refugee with sharp, inspiriting ejaculations, and sending up a ringing

shout of exultation when the saving gates closed upon him and the cheated

pursuer sank exhausted at the threshold.  But sometimes the flying

criminal fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door, when one

more brave stride, one more brief second of time would have brought his

feet upon the sacred ground and barred him against all harm.  Where did

these isolated pagans get this idea of a City of Refuge--this ancient

Oriental custom?



This old sanctuary was sacred to all--even to rebels in arms and invading

armies.  Once within its walls, and confession made to the priest and

absolution obtained, the wretch with a price upon his head could go forth

without fear and without danger--he was tabu, and to harm him was death.

The routed rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this place to

claim sanctuary, and many were thus saved.



Close to the corner of the great inclosure is a round structure of stone,

some six or eight feet high, with a level top about ten or twelve in

diameter.  This was the place of execution.  A high palisade of cocoanut

piles shut out the cruel scenes from the vulgar multitude.  Here

criminals were killed, the flesh stripped from the bones and burned, and

the bones secreted in holes in the body of the structure.  If the man had

been guilty of a high crime, the entire corpse was burned.



The walls of the temple are a study.  The same food for speculation that

is offered the visitor to the Pyramids of Egypt he will find here--the

mystery of how they were constructed by a people unacquainted with

science and mechanics.  The natives have no invention of their own for

hoisting heavy weights, they had no beasts of burden, and they have never

even shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever.  Yet some of the

lava blocks quarried out, brought over rough, broken ground, and built

into this wall, six or seven feet from the ground, are of prodigious size

and would weigh tons.  How did they transport and how raise them?



Both the inner and outer surfaces of the walls present a smooth front and

are very creditable specimens of masonry.  The blocks are of all manner

of shapes and sizes, but yet are fitted together with the neatest

exactness.  The gradual narrowing of the wall from the base upward is

accurately preserved.



No cement was used, but the edifice is firm and compact and is capable of

resisting storm and decay for centuries.  Who built this temple, and how

was it built, and when, are mysteries that may never be unraveled.

Outside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffin-shaped stone eleven

feet four inches long and three feet square at the small end (it would

weigh a few thousand pounds), which the high chief who held sway over

this district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day

to use as a lounge!  This circumstance is established by the most

reliable traditions.  He used to lie down on it, in his indolent way, and

keep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no

"soldiering" done.  And no doubt there was not any done to speak of,

because he was a man of that sort of build that incites to attention to

business on the part of an employee.



He was fourteen or fifteen feet high.  When he stretched himself at full

length on his lounge, his legs hung down over the end, and when he snored

he woke the dead.  These facts are all attested by irrefragable

tradition.



On the other side of the temple is a monstrous seven-ton rock, eleven

feet long, seven feet wide and three feet thick.  It is raised a foot or

a foot and a half above the ground, and rests upon half a dozen little

stony pedestals.  The same old fourteen-footer brought it down from the

mountain, merely for fun (he had his own notions about fun), and propped

it up as we find it now and as others may find it a century hence, for it

would take a score of horses to budge it from its position.  They say

that fifty or sixty years ago the proud Queen Kaahumanu used to fly to

this rock for safety, whenever she had been making trouble with her

fierce husband, and hide under it until his wrath was appeased.  But

these Kanakas will lie, and this statement is one of their ablest

efforts--for Kaahumanu was six feet high--she was bulky--she was built

like an ox--and she could no more have squeezed herself under that rock

than she could have passed between the cylinders of a sugar mill.  What

could she gain by it, even if she succeeded?  To be chased and abused by

a savage husband could not be otherwise than humiliating to her high

spirit, yet it could never make her feel so flat as an hour's repose

under that rock would.



We walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width; a road

paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable

degree of engineering skill.  Some say that that wise old pagan,

Kamehameha I planned and built it, but others say it was built so long

before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out

of the traditions.  In either case, however, as the handiwork of an

untaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest.  The

stones are worn and smooth, and pushed apart in places, so that the road

has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of

Rome which one sees in pictures.



The object of our tramp was to visit a great natural curiosity at the

base of the foothills--a congealed cascade of lava.  Some old forgotten

volcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountain side

here, and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff

some fifty feet high to the ground below.  The flaming torrent cooled in

the winds from the sea, and remains there to-day, all seamed, and frothed

and rippled a petrified Niagara.  It is very picturesque, and withal so

natural that one might almost imagine it still flowed.  A smaller stream

trickled over the cliff and built up an isolated pyramid about thirty

feet high, which has the semblance of a mass of large gnarled and knotted

vines and roots and stems intricately twisted and woven together.



We passed in behind the cascade and the pyramid, and found the bluff

pierced by several cavernous tunnels, whose crooked courses we followed a

long distance.



Two of these winding tunnels stand as proof of Nature's mining abilities.

Their floors are level, they are seven feet wide, and their roofs are

gently arched.  Their height is not uniform, however.  We passed through

one a hundred feet long, which leads through a spur of the hill and opens

out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests in the

waves of the sea.  It is a commodious tunnel, except that there are

occasional places in it where one must stoop to pass under.  The roof is

lava, of course, and is thickly studded with little lava-pointed icicles

an inch long, which hardened as they dripped.  They project as closely

together as the iron teeth of a corn-sheller, and if one will stand up

straight and walk any distance there, he can get his hair combed free of

charge.









CHAPTER LXXIV.



We got back to the schooner in good time, and then sailed down to Kau,

where we disembarked and took final leave of the vessel.  Next day we

bought horses and bent our way over the summer-clad mountain-terraces,

toward the great volcano of Kilauea (Ke-low-way-ah).  We made nearly a

two days' journey of it, but that was on account of laziness.  Toward

sunset on the second day, we reached an elevation of some four thousand

feet above sea level, and as we picked our careful way through billowy

wastes of lava long generations ago stricken dead and cold in the climax

of its tossing fury, we began to come upon signs of the near presence of

the volcano--signs in the nature of ragged fissures that discharged jets

of sulphurous vapor into the air, hot from the molten ocean down in the

bowels of the mountain.



Shortly the crater came into view.  I have seen Vesuvius since, but it

was a mere toy, a child's volcano, a soup-kettle, compared to this.

Mount Vesuvius is a shapely cone thirty-six hundred feet high; its crater

an inverted cone only three hundred feet deep, and not more than a

thousand feet in diameter, if as much as that; its fires meagre, modest,

and docile.--But here was a vast, perpendicular, walled cellar, nine

hundred feet deep in some places, thirteen hundred in others, level-

floored, and ten miles in circumference!  Here was a yawning pit upon

whose floor the armies of Russia could camp, and have room to spare.



Perched upon the edge of the crater, at the opposite end from where we

stood, was a small look-out house--say three miles away.  It assisted us,

by comparison, to comprehend and appreciate the great depth of the basin

--it looked like a tiny martin-box clinging at the eaves of a cathedral.

After some little time spent in resting and looking and ciphering, we

hurried on to the hotel.



By the path it is half a mile from the Volcano House to the lookout-

house.  After a hearty supper we waited until it was thoroughly dark and

then started to the crater.  The first glance in that direction revealed

a scene of wild beauty.  There was a heavy fog over the crater and it was

splendidly illuminated by the glare from the fires below.  The

illumination was two miles wide and a mile high, perhaps; and if you

ever, on a dark night and at a distance beheld the light from thirty or

forty blocks of distant buildings all on fire at once, reflected strongly

against over-hanging clouds, you can form a fair idea of what this looked

like.



A colossal column of cloud towered to a great height in the air

immediately above the crater, and the outer swell of every one of its

vast folds was dyed with a rich crimson luster, which was subdued to a

pale rose tint in the depressions between.  It glowed like a muffled

torch and stretched upward to a dizzy height toward the zenith.  I

thought it just possible that its like had not been seen since the

children of Israel wandered on their long march through the desert so

many centuries ago over a path illuminated by the mysterious "pillar of

fire."  And I was sure that I now had a vivid conception of what the

majestic "pillar of fire" was like, which almost amounted to a

revelation.



Arrived at the little thatched lookout house, we rested our elbows on the

railing in front and looked abroad over the wide crater and down over the

sheer precipice at the seething fires beneath us.  The view was a

startling improvement on my daylight experience.  I turned to see the

effect on the balance of the company and found the reddest-faced set of

men I almost ever saw.  In the strong light every countenance glowed like

red-hot iron, every shoulder was suffused with crimson and shaded

rearward into dingy, shapeless obscurity!  The place below looked like

the infernal regions and these men like half-cooled devils just come up

on a furlough.



I turned my eyes upon the volcano again.  The "cellar" was tolerably well

lighted up.  For a mile and a half in front of us and half a mile on

either side, the floor of the abyss was magnificently illuminated; beyond

these limits the mists hung down their gauzy curtains and cast a

deceptive gloom over all that made the twinkling fires in the remote

corners of the crater seem countless leagues removed--made them seem like

the camp-fires of a great army far away.  Here was room for the

imagination to work!  You could imagine those lights the width of a

continent away--and that hidden under the intervening darkness were

hills, and winding rivers, and weary wastes of plain and desert--and even

then the tremendous vista stretched on, and on, and on!--to the fires and

far beyond!  You could not compass it--it was the idea of eternity made

tangible--and the longest end of it made visible to the naked eye!



The greater part of the vast floor of the desert under us was as black as

ink, and apparently smooth and level; but over a mile square of it was

ringed and streaked and striped with a thousand branching streams of

liquid and gorgeously brilliant fire!  It looked like a colossal railroad

map of the State of Massachusetts done in chain lightning on a midnight

sky.  Imagine it--imagine a coal-black sky shivered into a tangled net-

work of angry fire!



Here and there were gleaming holes a hundred feet in diameter, broken in

the dark crust, and in them the melted lava--the color a dazzling white

just tinged with yellow--was boiling and surging furiously; and from

these holes branched numberless bright torrents in many directions, like

the spokes of a wheel, and kept a tolerably straight course for a while

and then swept round in huge rainbow curves, or made a long succession of

sharp worm-fence angles, which looked precisely like the fiercest jagged

lightning.  These streams met other streams, and they mingled with and

crossed and recrossed each other in every conceivable direction, like

skate tracks on a popular skating ground.  Sometimes streams twenty or

thirty feet wide flowed from the holes to some distance without dividing

--and through the opera-glasses we could see that they ran down small,

steep hills and were genuine cataracts of fire, white at their source,

but soon cooling and turning to the richest red, grained with alternate

lines of black and gold.  Every now and then masses of the dark crust

broke away and floated slowly down these streams like rafts down a river.

Occasionally the molten lava flowing under the superincumbent crust broke

through--split a dazzling streak, from five hundred to a thousand feet

long, like a sudden flash of lightning, and then acre after acre of the

cold lava parted into fragments, turned up edgewise like cakes of ice

when a great river breaks up, plunged downward and were swallowed in the

crimson cauldron.  Then the wide expanse of the "thaw" maintained a ruddy

glow for a while, but shortly cooled and became black and level again.

During a "thaw," every dismembered cake was marked by a glittering white

border which was superbly shaded inward by aurora borealis rays, which

were a flaming yellow where they joined the white border, and from thence

toward their points tapered into glowing crimson, then into a rich, pale

carmine, and finally into a faint blush that held its own a moment and

then dimmed and turned black.  Some of the streams preferred to mingle

together in a tangle of fantastic circles, and then they looked something

like the confusion of ropes one sees on a ship's deck when she has just

taken in sail and dropped anchor--provided one can imagine those ropes on

fire.



Through the glasses, the little fountains scattered about looked very

beautiful.  They boiled, and coughed, and spluttered, and discharged

sprays of stringy red fire--of about the consistency of mush, for

instance--from ten to fifteen feet into the air, along with a shower of

brilliant white sparks--a quaint and unnatural mingling of gouts of blood

and snow-flakes!



We had circles and serpents and streaks of lightning all twined and

wreathed and tied together, without a break throughout an area more than

a mile square (that amount of ground was covered, though it was not

strictly "square"), and it was with a feeling of placid exultation that

we reflected that many years had elapsed since any visitor had seen such

a splendid display--since any visitor had seen anything more than the now

snubbed and insignificant "North" and "South" lakes in action.  We had

been reading old files of Hawaiian newspapers and the "Record Book" at

the Volcano House, and were posted.



I could see the North Lake lying out on the black floor away off in the

outer edge of our panorama, and knitted to it by a web-work of lava

streams.  In its individual capacity it looked very little more

respectable than a schoolhouse on fire.  True, it was about nine hundred

feet long and two or three hundred wide, but then, under the present

circumstances, it necessarily appeared rather insignificant, and besides

it was so distant from us.



I forgot to say that the noise made by the bubbling lava is not great,

heard as we heard it from our lofty perch.  It makes three distinct

sounds--a rushing, a hissing, and a coughing or puffing sound; and if you

stand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine

that you are sweeping down a river on a large low-pressure steamer, and

that you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers, the puffing

from her escape-pipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her

wheels.  The smell of sulphur is strong, but not unpleasant to a sinner.



We left the lookout house at ten o'clock in a half cooked condition,

because of the heat from Pele's furnaces, and wrapping up in blankets,

for the night was cold, we returned to our Hotel.









CHAPTER LXXV.



The next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater, for

we desired to traverse its floor and see the "North Lake" (of fire) which

lay two miles away, toward the further wall.  After dark half a dozen of

us set out, with lanterns and native guides, and climbed down a crazy,

thousand-foot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall, and

reached the bottom in safety.



The irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the floor

looked black and cold; but when we ran out upon it we found it hot yet,

to the feet, and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed the

underlying fires gleaming vindictively.  A neighboring cauldron was

threatening to overflow, and this added to the dubiousness of the

situation.  So the native guides refused to continue the venture, and

then every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette.  He said he

had been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could

find his way through it at night.  He thought that a run of three hundred

yards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our

shoe-soles.  His pluck gave me back-bone.  We took one lantern and

instructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out house

to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost, and then the party

started back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run.

We skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk

dispatch and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet.  Then

we took things leisurely and comfortably, jumping tolerably wide and

probably bottomless chasms, and threading our way through picturesque

lava upheavals with considerable confidence.  When we got fairly away

from the cauldrons of boiling fire, we seemed to be in a gloomy desert,

and a suffocatingly dark one, surrounded by dim walls that seemed to

tower to the sky.  The only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high

overhead.



By and by Marlette shouted "Stop!" I never stopped quicker in my life.

I asked what the matter was.  He said we were out of the path.  He said

we must not try to go on till we found it again, for we were surrounded

with beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge

down a thousand feet.  I thought eight hundred would answer for me, and

was about to say so when Marlette partly proved his statement by

accidentally crushing through and disappearing to his arm-pits.



He got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern.  He said there

was only one path and that it was but vaguely defined.  We could not find

it.  The lava surface was all alike in the lantern light.  But he was an

ingenious man.  He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that

we were out of the path, but his feet.  He had noticed a crisp grinding

of fine lava-needles under his feet, and some instinct reminded him that

in the path these were all worn away.  So he put the lantern behind him,

and began to search with his boots instead of his eyes.  It was good

sagacity.  The first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind

under it he announced that the trail was found again; and after that we

kept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us

in time.



It was a long tramp, but an exciting one.  We reached the North Lake

between ten and eleven o'clock, and sat down on a huge overhanging lava-

shelf, tired but satisfied.  The spectacle presented was worth coming

double the distance to see.  Under us, and stretching away before us, was

a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent.  The glare

from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear to

look upon it steadily.



It was like gazing at the sun at noon-day, except that the glare was not

quite so white.  At unequal distances all around the shores of the lake

were nearly white-hot chimneys or hollow drums of lava, four or five feet

high, and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of lava-gouts and

gem spangles, some white, some red and some golden--a ceaseless

bombardment, and one that fascinated the eye with its unapproachable

splendor.  The mere distant jets, sparkling up through an intervening

gossamer veil of vapor, seemed miles away; and the further the curving

ranks of fiery fountains receded, the more fairy-like and beautiful they

appeared.



Now and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm

down ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise; and

then all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary

dwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon, then burst

asunder, and out of its heart would flit a pale-green film of vapor, and

float upward and vanish in the darkness--a released soul soaring homeward

from captivity with the damned, no doubt.  The crashing plunge of the

ruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows

lashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch.  By

and by, a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the

lake, jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a

suggestion that may have been intended for a hint, and may not.  We did

not wait to see.



We got lost again on our way back, and were more than an hour hunting for

the path.  We were where we could see the beacon lantern at the look-out

house at the time, but thought it was a star and paid no attention to it.

We reached the hotel at two o'clock in the morning pretty well fagged

out.



Kilauea never overflows its vast crater, but bursts a passage for its

lava through the mountain side when relief is necessary, and then the

destruction is fearful.  About 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and

sent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea, which swept away

forests, huts, plantations and every thing else that lay in its path.

The stream was five miles broad, in places, and two hundred feet deep,

and the distance it traveled was forty miles.  It tore up and bore away

acre-patches of land on its bosom like rafts--rocks, trees and all

intact.  At night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea; and

at a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight.  The

atmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling

ashes, pumice stones and cinders; countless columns of smoke rose up and

blended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed with

a ruddy flush reflected from the fires below; here and there jets of lava

sprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into rocket-sprays that

returned to earth in a crimson rain; and all the while the laboring

mountain shook with Nature's great palsy and voiced its distress in

moanings and the muffled booming of subterranean thunders.



Fishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore, where the lava

entered the sea.  The earthquakes caused some loss of human life, and a

prodigious tidal wave swept inland, carrying every thing before it and

drowning a number of natives.  The devastation consummated along the

route traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable.  Only

a Pompeii and a Herculaneum were needed at the foot of Kilauea to make

the story of the irruption immortal.









CHAPTER LXXVI.



We rode horseback all around the island of Hawaii (the crooked road

making the distance two hundred miles), and enjoyed the journey very

much.  We were more than a week making the trip, because our Kanaka

horses would not go by a house or a hut without stopping--whip and spur

could not alter their minds about it, and so we finally found that it

economized time to let them have their way.  Upon inquiry the mystery was

explained: the natives are such thorough-going gossips that they never

pass a house without stopping to swap news, and consequently their horses

learn to regard that sort of thing as an essential part of the whole duty

of man, and his salvation not to be compassed without it.  However, at a

former crisis of my life I had once taken an aristocratic young lady out

driving, behind a horse that had just retired from a long and honorable

career as the moving impulse of a milk wagon, and so this present

experience awoke a reminiscent sadness in me in place of the exasperation

more natural to the occasion.  I remembered how helpless I was that day,

and how humiliated; how ashamed I was of having intimated to the girl

that I had always owned the horse and was accustomed to grandeur; how

hard I tried to appear easy, and even vivacious, under suffering that was

consuming my vitals; how placidly and maliciously the girl smiled, and

kept on smiling, while my hot blushes baked themselves into a permanent

blood-pudding in my face; how the horse ambled from one side of the

street to the other and waited complacently before every third house two

minutes and a quarter while I belabored his back and reviled him in my

heart; how I tried to keep him from turning corners and failed; how I

moved heaven and earth to get him out of town, and did not succeed; how

he traversed the entire settlement and delivered imaginary milk at a

hundred and sixty-two different domiciles, and how he finally brought up

at a dairy depot and refused to budge further, thus rounding and

completing the revealment of what the plebeian service of his life had

been; how, in eloquent silence, I walked the girl home, and how, when I

took leave of her, her parting remark scorched my soul and appeared to

blister me all over: she said that my horse was a fine, capable animal,

and I must have taken great comfort in him in my time--but that if I

would take along some milk-tickets next time, and appear to deliver them

at the various halting places, it might expedite his movements a little.

There was a coolness between us after that.



In one place in the island of Hawaii, we saw a laced and ruffled cataract

of limpid water leaping from a sheer precipice fifteen hundred feet high;

but that sort of scenery finds its stanchest ally in the arithmetic

rather than in spectacular effect.  If one desires to be so stirred by a

poem of Nature wrought in the happily commingled graces of picturesque

rocks, glimpsed distances, foliage, color, shifting lights and shadows,

and failing water, that the tears almost come into his eyes so potent is

the charm exerted, he need not go away from America to enjoy such an

experience.  The Rainbow Fall, in Watkins Glen (N.Y.), on the Erie

railway, is an example.  It would recede into pitiable insignificance if

the callous tourist drew on arithmetic on it; but left to compete for the

honors simply on scenic grace and beauty--the grand, the august and the

sublime being barred the contest--it could challenge the old world and

the new to produce its peer.



In one locality, on our journey, we saw some horses that had been born

and reared on top of the mountains, above the range of running water, and

consequently they had never drank that fluid in their lives, but had been

always accustomed to quenching their thirst by eating dew-laden or

shower-wetted leaves.  And now it was destructively funny to see them

sniff suspiciously at a pail of water, and then put in their noses and

try to take a bite out of the fluid, as if it were a solid.  Finding it

liquid, they would snatch away their heads and fall to trembling,

snorting and showing other evidences of fright.  When they became

convinced at last that the water was friendly and harmless, they thrust

in their noses up to their eyes, brought out a mouthful of water, and

proceeded to chew it complacently.  We saw a man coax, kick and spur one

of them five or ten minutes before he could make it cross a running

stream.  It spread its nostrils, distended its eyes and trembled all

over, just as horses customarily do in the presence of a serpent--and for

aught I know it thought the crawling stream was a serpent.



In due course of time our journey came to an end at Kawaehae (usually

pronounced To-a-hi--and before we find fault with this elaborate

orthographical method of arriving at such an unostentatious result, let

us lop off the ugh from our word "though").  I made this horseback trip

on a mule.  I paid ten dollars for him at Kau (Kah-oo), added four to get

him shod, rode him two hundred miles, and then sold him for fifteen

dollars.  I mark the circumstance with a white stone (in the absence of

chalk--for I never saw a white stone that a body could mark anything

with, though out of respect for the ancients I have tried it often

enough); for up to that day and date it was the first strictly commercial

transaction I had ever entered into, and come out winner.  We returned to

Honolulu, and from thence sailed to the island of Maui, and spent several

weeks there very pleasantly.  I still remember, with a sense of indolent

luxury, a picnicing excursion up a romantic gorge there, called the Iao

Valley.  The trail lay along the edge of a brawling stream in the bottom

of the gorge--a shady route, for it was well roofed with the verdant

domes of forest trees.  Through openings in the foliage we glimpsed

picturesque scenery that revealed ceaseless changes and new charms with

every step of our progress.  Perpendicular walls from one to three

thousand feet high guarded the way, and were sumptuously plumed with

varied foliage, in places, and in places swathed in waving ferns.

Passing shreds of cloud trailed their shadows across these shining

fronts, mottling them with blots; billowy masses of white vapor hid the

turreted summits, and far above the vapor swelled a background of

gleaming green crags and cones that came and went, through the veiling

mists, like islands drifting in a fog; sometimes the cloudy curtain

descended till half the canon wall was hidden, then shredded gradually

away till only airy glimpses of the ferny front appeared through it--then

swept aloft and left it glorified in the sun again.  Now and then, as our

position changed, rocky bastions swung out from the wall, a mimic ruin of

castellated ramparts and crumbling towers clothed with mosses and hung

with garlands of swaying vines, and as we moved on they swung back again

and hid themselves once more in the foliage.  Presently a verdure-clad

needle of stone, a thousand feet high, stepped out from behind a corner,

and mounted guard over the mysteries of the valley.  It seemed to me that

if Captain Cook needed a monument, here was one ready made--therefore,

why not put up his sign here, and sell out the venerable cocoanut stump?



But the chief pride of Maui is her dead volcano of Haleakala--which

means, translated, "the house of the sun."  We climbed a thousand feet up

the side of this isolated colossus one afternoon; then camped, and next

day climbed the remaining nine thousand feet, and anchored on the summit,

where we built a fire and froze and roasted by turns, all night.  With

the first pallor of dawn we got up and saw things that were new to us.

Mounted on a commanding pinnacle, we watched Nature work her silent

wonders.  The sea was spread abroad on every hand, its tumbled surface

seeming only wrinkled and dimpled in the distance.  A broad valley below

appeared like an ample checker-board, its velvety green sugar plantations

alternating with dun squares of barrenness and groves of trees diminished

to mossy tufts.  Beyond the valley were mountains picturesquely grouped

together; but bear in mind, we fancied that we were looking up at these

things--not down.  We seemed to sit in the bottom of a symmetrical bowl

ten thousand feet deep, with the valley and the skirting sea lifted away

into the sky above us!  It was curious; and not only curious, but

aggravating; for it was having our trouble all for nothing, to climb ten

thousand feet toward heaven and then have to look up at our scenery.

However, we had to be content with it and make the best of it; for, all

we could do we could not coax our landscape down out of the clouds.

Formerly, when I had read an article in which Poe treated of this

singular fraud perpetrated upon the eye by isolated great altitudes,

I had looked upon the matter as an invention of his own fancy.



I have spoken of the outside view--but we had an inside one, too.  That

was the yawning dead crater, into which we now and then tumbled rocks,

half as large as a barrel, from our perch, and saw them go careering down

the almost perpendicular sides, bounding three hundred feet at a jump;

kicking up cast-clouds wherever they struck; diminishing to our view as

they sped farther into distance; growing invisible, finally, and only

betraying their course by faint little puffs of dust; and coming to a

halt at last in the bottom of the abyss, two thousand five hundred feet

down from where they started!  It was magnificent sport.  We wore

ourselves out at it.



The crater of Vesuvius, as I have before remarked, is a modest pit about

a thousand feet deep and three thousand in circumference; that of Kilauea

is somewhat deeper, and ten miles in circumference.  But what are either

of them compared to the vacant stomach of Haleakala?  I will not offer

any figures of my own, but give official ones--those of Commander Wilkes,

U.S.N., who surveyed it and testifies that it is twenty-seven miles in

circumference!  If it had a level bottom it would make a fine site for a

city like London.  It must have afforded a spectacle worth contemplating

in the old days when its furnaces gave full rein to their anger.



Presently vagrant white clouds came drifting along, high over the sea and

the valley; then they came in couples and groups; then in imposing

squadrons; gradually joining their forces, they banked themselves solidly

together, a thousand feet under us, and totally shut out land and ocean--

not a vestige of anything was left in view but just a little of the rim

of the crater, circling away from the pinnacle whereon we sat (for a

ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts without had drifted

through a chasm in the crater wall and filed round and round, and

gathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was stored to the

brim with a fleecy fog).  Thus banked, motion ceased, and silence

reigned.  Clear to the horizon, league on league, the snowy floor

stretched without a break--not level, but in rounded folds, with shallow

creases between, and with here and there stately piles of vapory

architecture lifting themselves aloft out of the common plain--some near

at hand, some in the middle distances, and others relieving the monotony

of the remote solitudes.  There was little conversation, for the

impressive scene overawed speech.  I felt like the Last Man, neglected of

the judgment, and left pinnacled in mid-heaven, a forgotten relic of a

vanished world.



While the hush yet brooded, the messengers of the coming resurrection

appeared in the East.  A growing warmth suffused the horizon, and soon

the sun emerged and looked out over the cloud-waste, flinging bars of

ruddy light across it, staining its folds and billow-caps with blushes,

purpling the shaded troughs between, and glorifying the massy vapor-

palaces and cathedrals with a wasteful splendor of all blendings and

combinations of rich coloring.



It was the sublimest spectacle I ever witnessed, and I think the memory

of it will remain with me always.









CHAPTER LXXVII.



I stumbled upon one curious character in the Island of Mani.  He became a

sore annoyance to me in the course of time.  My first glimpse of him was

in a sort of public room in the town of Lahaina.  He occupied a chair at

the opposite side of the apartment, and sat eyeing our party with

interest for some minutes, and listening as critically to what we were

saying as if he fancied we were talking to him and expecting him to

reply.  I thought it very sociable in a stranger.  Presently, in the

course of conversation, I made a statement bearing upon the subject under

discussion--and I made it with due modesty, for there was nothing

extraordinary about it, and it was only put forth in illustration of a

point at issue.  I had barely finished when this person spoke out with

rapid utterance and feverish anxiety:



"Oh, that was certainly remarkable, after a fashion, but you ought to

have seen my chimney--you ought to have seen my chimney, sir!  Smoke!

I wish I may hang if--Mr. Jones, you remember that chimney--you must

remember that chimney!  No, no--I recollect, now, you warn't living on

this side of the island then.  But I am telling you nothing but the

truth, and I wish I may never draw another breath if that chimney didn't

smoke so that the smoke actually got caked in it and I had to dig it out

with a pickaxe!  You may smile, gentlemen, but the High Sheriff's got a

hunk of it which I dug out before his eyes, and so it's perfectly easy

for you to go and examine for yourselves."



The interruption broke up the conversation, which had already begun to

lag, and we presently hired some natives and an out-rigger canoe or two,

and went out to overlook a grand surf-bathing contest.



Two weeks after this, while talking in a company, I looked up and

detected this same man boring through and through me with his intense

eye, and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to

speak.  The moment I paused, he said:



"Beg your pardon, sir, beg your pardon, but it can only be considered

remarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation.  Sir,

contrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience, it

instantly becomes commonplace.  No, not that--for I will not speak so

discourteously of any experience in the career of a stranger and a

gentleman--but I am obliged to say that you could not, and you would not

ever again refer to this tree as a large one, if you could behold, as I

have, the great Yakmatack tree, in the island of Ounaska, sea of

Kamtchatka--a tree, sir, not one inch less than four hundred and fifteen

feet in solid diameter!--and I wish I may die in a minute if it isn't so!

Oh, you needn't look so questioning, gentlemen; here's old Cap Saltmarsh

can say whether I know what I'm talking about or not.  I showed him the

tree."



Captain Saltmarsh--"Come, now, cat your anchor, lad--you're heaving too

taut.  You promised to show me that stunner, and I walked more than

eleven mile with you through the cussedest jungle I ever see, a hunting

for it; but the tree you showed me finally warn't as big around as a beer

cask, and you know that your own self, Markiss."



"Hear the man talk!  Of course the tree was reduced that way, but didn't

I explain it?  Answer me, didn't I?  Didn't I say I wished you could have

seen it when I first saw it?  When you got up on your ear and called me

names, and said I had brought you eleven miles to look at a sapling,

didn't I explain to you that all the whale-ships in the North Seas had

been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years?  And did you

s'pose the tree could last for-ever, con-found it?  I don't see why you

want to keep back things that way, and try to injure a person that's

never done you any harm."



Somehow this man's presence made me uncomfortable, and I was glad when a

native arrived at that moment to say that Muckawow, the most

companionable and luxurious among the rude war-chiefs of the Islands,

desired us to come over and help him enjoy a missionary whom he had found

trespassing on his grounds.



I think it was about ten days afterward that, as I finished a statement I

was making for the instruction of a group of friends and acquaintances,

and which made no pretence of being extraordinary, a familiar voice

chimed instantly in on the heels of my last word, and said:



"But, my dear sir, there was nothing remarkable about that horse, or the

circumstance either--nothing in the world!  I mean no sort of offence

when I say it, sir, but you really do not know anything whatever about

speed.  Bless your heart, if you could only have seen my mare Margaretta;

there was a beast!--there was lightning for you!  Trot!  Trot is no name

for it--she flew!  How she could whirl a buggy along!  I started her out

once, sir--Colonel Bilgewater, you recollect that animal perfectly well--

I started her out about thirty or thirty-five yards ahead of the

awfullest storm I ever saw in my life, and it chased us upwards of

eighteen miles!  It did, by the everlasting hills!  And I'm telling you

nothing but the unvarnished truth when I say that not one single drop of

rain fell on me--not a single drop, sir!  And I swear to it!  But my dog

was a-swimming behind the wagon all the way!"



For a week or two I stayed mostly within doors, for I seemed to meet this

person everywhere, and he had become utterly hateful to me.  But one

evening I dropped in on Captain Perkins and his friends, and we had a

sociable time.  About ten o'clock I chanced to be talking about a

merchant friend of mine, and without really intending it, the remark

slipped out that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his

workmen.  Instantly, through the steam of a hot whiskey punch on the

opposite side of the room, a remembered voice shot--and for a moment I

trembled on the imminent verge of profanity:



"Oh, my dear sir, really you expose yourself when you parade that as a

surprising circumstance.  Bless your heart and hide, you are ignorant of

the very A B C of meanness! ignorant as the unborn babe! ignorant as

unborn twins!  You don't know anything about it!  It is pitiable to see

you, sir, a well-spoken and prepossessing stranger, making such an

enormous pow-wow here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is

perfectly humiliating!  Look me in the eye, if you please; look me in the

eye.  John James Godfrey was the son of poor but honest parents in the

State of Mississippi--boyhood friend of mine--bosom comrade in later

years.  Heaven rest his noble spirit, he is gone from us now.  John James

Godfrey was hired by the Hayblossom Mining Company in California to do

some blasting for them--the "Incorporated Company of Mean Men," the boys

used to call it.



"Well, one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep and put in an awful

blast of powder, and was standing over it ramming it down with an iron

crowbar about nine foot long, when the cussed thing struck a spark and

fired the powder, and scat! away John Godfrey whizzed like a skyrocket,

him and his crowbar!  Well, sir, he kept on going up in the air higher

and higher, till he didn't look any bigger than a boy--and he kept going

on up higher and higher, till he didn't look any bigger than a doll--and

he kept on going up higher and higher, till he didn't look any bigger

than a little small bee--and then he went out of sight!  Presently he

came in sight again, looking like a little small bee--and he came along

down further and further, till he looked as big as a doll again--and down

further and further, till he was as big as a boy again--and further and

further, till he was a full-sized man once more; and then him and his

crowbar came a wh-izzing down and lit right exactly in the same old

tracks and went to r-ramming down, and r-ramming down, and r-ramming down

again, just the same as if nothing had happened!  Now do you know, that

poor cuss warn't gone only sixteen minutes, and yet that Incorporated

Company of Mean Men DOCKED HIM FOR THE LOST TIME!"



I said I had the headache, and so excused myself and went home.  And on

my diary I entered "another night spoiled" by this offensive loafer.

And a fervent curse was set down with it to keep the item company.  And

the very next day I packed up, out of all patience, and left the Island.



Almost from the very beginning, I regarded that man as a liar.



The line of points represents an interval of years.  At the end of which

time the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be gratifyingly

and remarkably endorsed, and by wholly disinterested persons.  The man

Markiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his own bedroom (the

doors and windows securely fastened on the inside), dead; and on his

breast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging his friends to

suspect no innocent person of having any thing to do with his death, for

that it was the work of his own hands entirely.  Yet the jury brought in

the astounding verdict that deceased came to his death "by the hands of

some person or persons unknown!"  They explained that the perfectly

undeviating consistency of Markiss's character for thirty years towered

aloft as colossal and indestructible testimony, that whatever statement

he chose to make was entitled to instant and unquestioning acceptance as

a lie.  And they furthermore stated their belief that he was not dead,

and instanced the strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he

was dead--and beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long as

possible, which was done.  And so in the tropical climate of Lahaina the

coffin stood open for seven days, and then even the loyal jury gave him

up.  But they sat on him again, and changed their verdict to "suicide

induced by mental aberration"--because, said they, with penetration, "he

said he was dead, and he was dead; and would he have told the truth if he

had been in his right mind?  No, sir."









CHAPTER LXXVIII.



After half a year's luxurious vagrancy in the islands, I took shipping in

a sailing vessel, and regretfully returned to San Francisco--a voyage in

every way delightful, but without an incident: unless lying two long

weeks in a dead calm, eighteen hundred miles from the nearest land, may

rank as an incident.  Schools of whales grew so tame that day after day

they played about the ship among the porpoises and the sharks without the

least apparent fear of us, and we pelted them with empty bottles for lack

of better sport.  Twenty-four hours afterward these bottles would be

still lying on the glassy water under our noses, showing that the ship

had not moved out of her place in all that time.  The calm was absolutely

breathless, and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle.

For a whole day and part of a night we lay so close to another ship that

had drifted to our vicinity, that we carried on conversations with her

passengers, introduced each other by name, and became pretty intimately

acquainted with people we had never heard of before, and have never heard

of since.  This was the only vessel we saw during the whole lonely

voyage.  We had fifteen passengers, and to show how hard pressed they

were at last for occupation and amusement, I will mention that the

gentlemen gave a good part of their time every day, during the calm, to

trying to sit on an empty champagne bottle (lying on its side), and

thread a needle without touching their heels to the deck, or falling

over; and the ladies sat in the shade of the mainsail, and watched the

enterprise with absorbing interest.  We were at sea five Sundays; and

yet, but for the almanac, we never would have known but that all the

other days were Sundays too.



I was home again, in San Francisco, without means and without employment.

I tortured my brain for a saving scheme of some kind, and at last a

public lecture occurred to me!  I sat down and wrote one, in a fever of

hopeful anticipation.  I showed it to several friends, but they all shook

their heads.  They said nobody would come to hear me, and I would make a

humiliating failure of it.



They said that as I had never spoken in public, I would break down in the

delivery, anyhow.  I was disconsolate now.  But at last an editor slapped

me on the back and told me to "go ahead."  He said, "Take the largest

house in town, and charge a dollar a ticket."  The audacity of the

proposition was charming; it seemed fraught with practical worldly

wisdom, however.  The proprietor of the several theatres endorsed the

advice, and said I might have his handsome new opera-house at half price

--fifty dollars.  In sheer desperation I took it--on credit, for

sufficient reasons.  In three days I did a hundred and fifty dollars'

worth of printing and advertising, and was the most distressed and

frightened creature on the Pacific coast.  I could not sleep--who could,

under such circumstances?  For other people there was facetiousness in

the last line of my posters, but to me it was plaintive with a pang when

I wrote it:



           "Doors open at 7 1/2.  The trouble will begin at 8."



That line has done good service since.  Showmen have borrowed it

frequently.  I have even seen it appended to a newspaper advertisement

reminding school pupils in vacation what time next term would begin.  As

those three days of suspense dragged by, I grew more and more unhappy.

I had sold two hundred tickets among my personal friends, but I feared

they might not come.  My lecture, which had seemed "humorous" to me, at

first, grew steadily more and more dreary, till not a vestige of fun

seemed left, and I grieved that I could not bring a coffin on the stage

and turn the thing into a funeral.  I was so panic-stricken, at last,

that I went to three old friends, giants in stature, cordial by nature,

and stormy-voiced, and said:



"This thing is going to be a failure; the jokes in it are so dim that

nobody will ever see them; I would like to have you sit in the parquette,

and help me through."



They said they would.  Then I went to the wife of a popular citizen, and

said that if she was willing to do me a very great kindness, I would be

glad if she and her husband would sit prominently in the left-hand stage-

box, where the whole house could see them.  I explained that I should

need help, and would turn toward her and smile, as a signal, when I had

been delivered of an obscure joke--"and then," I added, "don't wait to

investigate, but respond!"



She promised.  Down the street I met a man I never had seen before.  He

had been drinking, and was beaming with smiles and good nature.  He said:



"My name's Sawyer.  You don't know me, but that don't matter.  I haven't

got a cent, but if you knew how bad I wanted to laugh, you'd give me a

ticket.  Come, now, what do you say?"



"Is your laugh hung on a hair-trigger?--that is, is it critical, or can

you get it off easy?"



My drawling infirmity of speech so affected him that he laughed a

specimen or two that struck me as being about the article I wanted, and I

gave him a ticket, and appointed him to sit in the second circle, in the

centre, and be responsible for that division of the house.  I gave him

minute instructions about how to detect indistinct jokes, and then went

away, and left him chuckling placidly over the novelty of the idea.



I ate nothing on the last of the three eventful days--I only suffered.

I had advertised that on this third day the box-office would be opened

for the sale of reserved seats.  I crept down to the theater at four in

the afternoon to see if any sales had been made.  The ticket seller was

gone, the box-office was locked up.  I had to swallow suddenly, or my

heart would have got out.  "No sales," I said to myself; "I might have

known it."  I thought of suicide, pretended illness, flight.  I thought

of these things in earnest, for I was very miserable and scared.  But of

course I had to drive them away, and prepare to meet my fate.  I could

not wait for half-past seven--I wanted to face the horror, and end it--

the feeling of many a man doomed to hang, no doubt.  I went down back

streets at six o'clock, and entered the theatre by the back door.

I stumbled my way in the dark among the ranks of canvas scenery, and

stood on the stage.  The house was gloomy and silent, and its emptiness

depressing.  I went into the dark among the scenes again, and for an hour

and a half gave myself up to the horrors, wholly unconscious of

everything else.  Then I heard a murmur; it rose higher and higher, and

ended in a crash, mingled with cheers.  It made my hair raise, it was so

close to me, and so loud.



There was a pause, and then another; presently came a third, and before I

well knew what I was about, I was in the middle of the stage, staring at

a sea of faces, bewildered by the fierce glare of the lights, and quaking

in every limb with a terror that seemed like to take my life away.  The

house was full, aisles and all!



The tummult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before

I could gain any command over myself.  Then I recognized the charity and

the friendliness in the faces before me, and little by little my fright

melted away, and I began to talk Within three or four minutes I was

comfortable, and even content.  My three chief allies, with three

auxiliaries, were on hand, in the parquette, all sitting together, all

armed with bludgeons, and all ready to make an onslaught upon the

feeblest joke that might show its head.  And whenever a joke did fall,

their bludgeons came down and their faces seemed to split from ear to

ear.



Sawyer, whose hearty countenance was seen looming redly in the centre of

the second circle, took it up, and the house was carried handsomely.

Inferior jokes never fared so royally before.  Presently I delivered a

bit of serious matter with impressive unction (it was my pet), and the

audience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me more than any

applause; and as I dropped the last word of the clause, I happened to

turn and catch Mrs.--'s intent and waiting eye; my conversation with her

flashed upon me, and in spite of all I could do I smiled.  She took it

for the signal, and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched off

the whole audience; and the explosion that followed was the triumph of

the evening.  I thought that that honest man Sawyer would choke himself;

and as for the bludgeons, they performed like pile-drivers.  But my poor

little morsel of pathos was ruined.  It was taken in good faith as an

intentional joke, and the prize one of the entertainment, and I wisely

let it go at that.



All the papers were kind in the morning; my appetite returned; I had a

abundance of money.  All's well that ends well.









CHAPTER LXXIX.



I launched out as a lecturer, now, with great boldness.  I had the field

all to myself, for public lectures were almost an unknown commodity in

the Pacific market.  They are not so rare, now, I suppose.  I took an old

personal friend along to play agent for me, and for two or three weeks we

roamed through Nevada and California and had a very cheerful time of it.

Two days before I lectured in Virginia City, two stagecoaches were robbed

within two miles of the town.  The daring act was committed just at dawn,

by six masked men, who sprang up alongside the coaches, presented

revolvers at the heads of the drivers and passengers, and commanded a

general dismount.  Everybody climbed down, and the robbers took their

watches and every cent they had.  Then they took gunpowder and blew up

the express specie boxes and got their contents.  The leader of the

robbers was a small, quick-spoken man, and the fame of his vigorous

manner and his intrepidity was in everybody's mouth when we arrived.



The night after instructing Virginia, I walked over the desolate "divide"

and down to Gold Hill, and lectured there.  The lecture done, I stopped

to talk with a friend, and did not start back till eleven.  The "divide"

was high, unoccupied ground, between the towns, the scene of twenty

midnight murders and a hundred robberies.  As we climbed up and stepped

out on this eminence, the Gold Hill lights dropped out of sight at our

backs, and the night closed down gloomy and dismal.  A sharp wind swept

the place, too, and chilled our perspiring bodies through.



"I tell you I don't like this place at night," said Mike the agent.



"Well, don't speak so loud," I said.  "You needn't remind anybody that we

are here."



Just then a dim figure approached me from the direction of Virginia--a

man, evidently.  He came straight at me, and I stepped aside to let him

pass; he stepped in the way and confronted me again.  Then I saw that he

had a mask on and was holding something in my face--I heard a click-click

and recognized a revolver in dim outline.  I pushed the barrel aside with

my hand and said:



"Don't!"



He ejaculated sharply:



"Your watch!  Your money!"



I said:



"You can have them with pleasure--but take the pistol away from my face,

please.  It makes me shiver."



"No remarks!  Hand out your money!"



"Certainly--I--"



"Put up your hands!  Don't you go for a weapon!  Put 'em up!  Higher!"



I held them above my head.



A pause.  Then:



"Are you going to hand out your money or not?"



I dropped my hands to my pockets and said:



Certainly!  I--"



"Put up your hands!  Do you want your head blown off?  Higher!"



I put them above my head again.



Another pause.



Are you going to hand out your money or not?  Ah-ah--again?  Put up your

hands!  By George, you want the head shot off you awful bad!"



"Well, friend, I'm trying my best to please you.  You tell me to give up

my money, and when I reach for it you tell me to put up my hands.  If you

would only--.  Oh, now--don't!  All six of you at me!  That other man

will get away while.--Now please take some of those revolvers out of my

face--do, if you please!  Every time one of them clicks, my liver comes

up into my throat!  If you have a mother--any of you--or if any of you

have ever had a mother--or a--grandmother--or a--"



"Cheese it!  Will you give up your money, or have we got to--.  There--

there--none of that!  Put up your hands!"



"Gentlemen--I know you are gentlemen by your--"



"Silence!  If you want to be facetious, young man, there are times and

places more fitting.  This is a serious business."



"You prick the marrow of my opinion.  The funerals I have attended in my

time were comedies compared to it.  Now I think--"



"Curse your palaver!  Your money!--your money!--your money!  Hold!--put

up your hands!"



"Gentlemen, listen to reason.  You see how I am situated--now don't put

those pistols so close--I smell the powder.



"You see how I am situated.  If I had four hands--so that I could hold up

two and--"



"Throttle him!  Gag him!  Kill him!"



"Gentlemen, don't!  Nobody's watching the other fellow.  Why don't some

of you--.  Ouch!  Take it away, please!



"Gentlemen, you see that I've got to hold up my hands; and so I can't take

out my money--but if you'll be so kind as to take it out for me, I will

do as much for you some--"



"Search him Beauregard--and stop his jaw with a bullet, quick, if he wags

it again.  Help Beauregard, Stonewall."



Then three of them, with the small, spry leader, adjourned to Mike and

fell to searching him.  I was so excited that my lawless fancy tortured

me to ask my two men all manner of facetious questions about their rebel

brother-generals of the South, but, considering the order they had

received, it was but common prudence to keep still.  When everything had

been taken from me,--watch, money, and a multitude of trifles of small

value,--I supposed I was free, and forthwith put my cold hands into my

empty pockets and began an inoffensive jig to warm my feet and stir up

some latent courage--but instantly all pistols were at my head, and the

order came again:



They stood Mike up alongside of me, with strict orders to keep his hands

above his head, too, and then the chief highwayman said:



"Beauregard, hide behind that boulder; Phil Sheridan, you hide behind

that other one; Stonewall Jackson, put yourself behind that sage-bush

there.  Keep your pistols bearing on these fellows, and if they take down

their hands within ten minutes, or move a single peg, let them have it!"



Then three disappeared in the gloom toward the several ambushes, and the

other three disappeared down the road toward Virginia.



It was depressingly still, and miserably cold.  Now this whole thing was

a practical joke, and the robbers were personal friends of ours in

disguise, and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the

whole operation, listening.  Mike knew all this, and was in the joke, but

I suspected nothing of it.  To me it was most uncomfortably genuine.

When we had stood there in the middle of the road five minutes, like a

couple of idiots, with our hands aloft, freezing to death by inches,

Mike's interest in the joke began to wane.  He said:



"The time's up, now, aint it?"



"No, you keep still.  Do you want to take any chances with these bloody

savages?"



Presently Mike said:



"Now the time's up, anyway.  I'm freezing."



"Well freeze.  Better freeze than carry your brains home in a basket.

Maybe the time is up, but how do we know?--got no watch to tell by.

I mean to give them good measure.  I calculate to stand here fifteen

minutes or die.  Don't you move."



So, without knowing it, I was making one joker very sick of his contract.

When we took our arms down at last, they were aching with cold and

fatigue, and when we went sneaking off, the dread I was in that the time

might not yet be up and that we would feel bullets in a moment, was not

sufficient to draw all my attention from the misery that racked my

stiffened body.



The joke of these highwayman friends of ours was mainly a joke upon

themselves; for they had waited for me on the cold hill-top two full

hours before I came, and there was very little fun in that; they were so

chilled that it took them a couple of weeks to get warm again.  Moreover,

I never had a thought that they would kill me to get money which it was

so perfectly easy to get without any such folly, and so they did not

really frighten me bad enough to make their enjoyment worth the trouble

they had taken.  I was only afraid that their weapons would go off

accidentally.  Their very numbers inspired me with confidence that no

blood would be intentionally spilled.  They were not smart; they ought to

have sent only one highwayman, with a double-barrelled shot gun, if they

desired to see the author of this volume climb a tree.



However, I suppose that in the long run I got the largest share of the

joke at last; and in a shape not foreseen by the highwaymen; for the

chilly exposure on the "divide" while I was in a perspiration gave me a

cold which developed itself into a troublesome disease and kept my hands

idle some three months, besides costing me quite a sum in doctor's bills.

Since then I play no practical jokes on people and generally lose my

temper when one is played upon me.



When I returned to San Francisco I projected a pleasure journey to Japan

and thence westward around the world; but a desire to see home again

changed my mind, and I took a berth in the steamship, bade good-bye to

the friendliest land and livest, heartiest community on our continent,

and came by the way of the Isthmus to New York--a trip that was not much

of a pic-nic excursion, for the cholera broke out among us on the passage

and we buried two or three bodies at sea every day.  I found home a

dreary place after my long absence; for half the children I had known

were now wearing whiskers or waterfalls, and few of the grown people I

had been acquainted with remained at their hearthstones prosperous and

happy--some of them had wandered to other scenes, some were in jail, and

the rest had been hanged.  These changes touched me deeply, and I went

away and joined the famous Quaker City European Excursion and carried my

tears to foreign lands.



Thus, after seven years of vicissitudes, ended a "pleasure trip" to the

silver mines of Nevada which had originally been intended to occupy only

three months.  However, I usually miss my calculations further than that.





MORAL.



If the reader thinks he is done, now, and that this book has no moral to

it, he is in error.  The moral of it is this: If you are of any account,

stay at home and make your way by faithful diligence; but if you are "no

account," go away from home, and then you will have to work, whether you

want to or not.  Thus you become a blessing to your friends by ceasing to

be a nuisance to them--if the people you go among suffer by the

operation.









APPENDIX. A.



BRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY.



Mormonism is only about forty years old, but its career has been full of

stir and adventure from the beginning, and is likely to remain so to the

end.  Its adherents have been hunted and hounded from one end of the

country to the other, and the result is that for years they have hated

all "Gentiles" indiscriminately and with all their might.  Joseph Smith,

the finder of the Book of Mormon and founder of the religion, was driven

from State to State with his mysterious copperplates and the miraculous

stones he read their inscriptions with.  Finally he instituted his

"church" in Ohio and Brigham Young joined it.  The neighbors began to

persecute, and apostasy commenced.  Brigham held to the faith and worked

hard.  He arrested desertion.  He did more--he added converts in the

midst of the trouble.  He rose in favor and importance with the brethren.

He was made one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church.  He shortly fought

his way to a higher post and a more powerful--President of the Twelve.

The neighbors rose up and drove the Mormons out of Ohio, and they settled

in Missouri.  Brigham went with them.  The Missourians drove them out and

they retreated to Nauvoo, Illinois.  They prospered there, and built a

temple which made some pretensions to architectural grace and achieved

some celebrity in a section of country where a brick court-house with a

tin dome and a cupola on it was contemplated with reverential awe.

But the Mormons were badgered and harried again by their neighbors.

All the proclamations Joseph Smith could issue denouncing polygamy and

repudiating it as utterly anti-Mormon were of no avail; the people of the

neighborhood, on both sides of the Mississippi, claimed that polygamy was

practised by the Mormons, and not only polygamy but a little of

everything that was bad.  Brigham returned from a mission to England,

where he had established a Mormon newspaper, and he brought back with him

several hundred converts to his preaching.  His influence among the

brethren augmented with every move he made.  Finally Nauvoo was invaded

by the Missouri and Illinois Gentiles, and Joseph Smith killed.  A Mormon

named Rigdon assumed the Presidency of the Mormon church and government,

in Smith's place, and even tried his hand at a prophecy or two.  But a

greater than he was at hand.  Brigham seized the advantage of the hour

and without other authority than superior brain and nerve and will,

hurled Rigdon from his high place and occupied it himself.  He did more.

He launched an elaborate curse at Rigdon and his disciples; and he

pronounced Rigdon's "prophecies" emanations from the devil, and ended by

"handing the false prophet over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand

years"--probably the longest term ever inflicted in Illinois.  The people

recognized their master.  They straightway elected Brigham Young

President, by a prodigious majority, and have never faltered in their

devotion to him from that day to this.  Brigham had forecast--a quality

which no other prominent Mormon has probably ever possessed.

He recognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than be moved.

By his command the people gathered together their meagre effects, turned

their backs upon their homes, and their faces toward the wilderness, and

on a bitter night in February filed in sorrowful procession across the

frozen Mississippi, lighted on their way by the glare from their burning

temple, whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired!  They camped,

several days afterward, on the western verge of Iowa, and poverty, want,

hunger, cold, sickness, grief and persecution did their work, and many

succumbed and died--martyrs, fair and true, whatever else they might have

been.  Two years the remnant remained there, while Brigham and a small

party crossed the country and founded Great Salt Lake City, purposely

choosing a land which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the

hated American nation.  Note that.  This was in 1847.  Brigham moved his

people there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall

again.  For the war closed and Mexico ceded Brigham's refuge to the

enemy--the United States!  In 1849 the Mormons organized a "free and

independent" government and erected the "State of Deseret," with Brigham

Young as its head.  But the very next year Congress deliberately snubbed

it and created the "Territory of Utah" out of the same accumulation of

mountains, sage-brush, alkali and general desolation,--but made Brigham

Governor of it.  Then for years the enormous migration across the plains

to California poured through the land of the Mormons and yet the church

remained staunch and true to its lord and master.  Neither hunger,

thirst, poverty, grief, hatred, contempt, nor persecution could drive the

Mormons from their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst for

gold, which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many nations

was not able to entice them!  That was the final test.  An experiment

that could survive that was an experiment with some substance to it

somewhere.



Great Salt Lake City throve finely, and so did Utah.  One of the last

things which Brigham Young had done before leaving Iowa, was to appear in

the pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet

Smith, and confer the prophetic succession, with all its dignities,

emoluments and authorities, upon "President Brigham Young!"  The people

accepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm, and Brigham's power

was sealed and secured for all time.  Within five years afterward he

openly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a

"revelation" which he pretended had been received nine years before by

Joseph Smith, albeit Joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to

the day of his death.



Now was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the small beginning and

steady progress of his official grandeur.  He had served successively as

a disciple in the ranks; home missionary; foreign missionary; editor and

publisher; Apostle; President of the Board of Apostles; President of all

Mormondom, civil and ecclesiastical; successor to the great Joseph by the

will of heaven; "prophet," "seer," "revelator."  There was but one

dignity higher which he could aspire to, and he reached out modestly and

took that--he proclaimed himself a God!



He claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter, and that he

will be its God, and his wives and children its goddesses, princes and

princesses.  Into it all faithful Mormons will be admitted, with their

families, and will take rank and consequence according to the number of

their wives and children.  If a disciple dies before he has had time to

accumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in

the next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children

for him after he is dead, and they are duly credited to his account and

his heavenly status advanced accordingly.



Let it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons have always been

ignorant, simple, of an inferior order of intellect, unacquainted with

the world and its ways; and let it be borne in mind that the wives of

these Mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their children

likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction; and then let it

be remembered that for forty years these creatures have been driven,

driven, driven, relentlessly!  and mobbed, beaten, and shot down; cursed,

despised, expatriated; banished to a remote desert, whither they

journeyed gaunt with famine and disease, disturbing the ancient solitudes

with their lamentations and marking the long way with graves of their

dead--and all because they were simply trying to live and worship God in

the way which they believed with all their hearts and souls to be the

true one.  Let all these things be borne in mind, and then it will not be

hard to account for the deathless hatred which the Mormons bear our

people and our government.



That hatred has "fed fat its ancient grudge" ever since Mormon Utah

developed into a self-supporting realm and the church waxed rich and

strong.  Brigham as Territorial Governor made it plain that Mormondom was

for the Mormons.  The United States tried to rectify all that by

appointing territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon

localities, but Brigham prepared to make their entrance into his

dominions difficult.  Three thousand United States troops had to go

across the plains and put these gentlemen in office.  And after they were

in office they were as helpless as so many stone images.  They made laws

which nobody minded and which could not be executed.  The federal judges

opened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday

spectacles for insolent crowds to gape at--for there was nothing to try,

nothing to do nothing on the dockets!  And if a Gentile brought a suit,

the Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict,

and when the judgment of the court was rendered no Mormon cared for it

and no officer could execute it.  Our Presidents shipped one cargo of

officials after another to Utah, but the result was always the same--they

sat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day

by day, they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its

reward in darker and darker looks, and in secret threats and warnings of

a more and more dismal nature--and at last they either succumbed and

became despised tools and toys of the Mormons, or got scared and

discomforted beyond all endurance and left the Territory.  If a brave

officer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven, some pliant

Buchanan or Pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place.

In 1857 General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of Utah.

And so it came very near being Harney governor and Cradlebaugh judge!--

two men who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky

comprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the

dictionary.  Simply (if for nothing else) for the variety they would have

made in a rather monotonous history of Federal servility and

helplessness, it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together in

Utah.



Up to the date of our visit to Utah, such had been the Territorial

record.  The Territorial government established there had been a hopeless

failure, and Brigham Young was the only real power in the land.  He was

an absolute monarch--a monarch who defied our President--a monarch who

laughed at our armies when they camped about his capital--a monarch who

received without emotion the news that the august Congress of the United

States had enacted a solemn law against polygamy, and then went forth

calmly and married twenty-five or thirty more wives.









B.

THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE.



The persecutions which the Mormons suffered so long--and which they

consider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern themselves--

they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay.  The now almost

forgotten "Mountain Meadows massacre" was their work.  It was very famous

in its day.  The whole United States rang with its horrors.  A few items

will refresh the reader's memory.  A great emigrant train from Missouri

and Arkansas passed through Salt Lake City and a few disaffected Mormons

joined it for the sake of the strong protection it afforded for their

escape.  In that matter lay sufficient cause for hot retaliation by the

Mormon chiefs.  Besides, these one hundred and forty-five or one hundred

and fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from Arkansas, where a

noted Mormon missionary had lately been killed, and in part from

Missouri, a State remembered with execrations as a bitter persecutor of

the saints when they were few and poor and friendless, here were

substantial additional grounds for lack of love for these wayfarers.

And finally, this train was rich, very rich in cattle, horses, mules and

other property--and how could the Mormons consistently keep up their

coveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not seize the "spoil"

of an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly "delivered it into their

hand?"



Wherefore, according to Mrs. C. V. Waite's entertaining book, "The Mormon

Prophet," it transpired that--



"A 'revelation' from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee or God, was

dispatched to President J. C. Haight, Bishop Higbee and J. D. Lee

(adopted son of Brigham), commanding them to raise all the forces they

could muster and trust, follow those cursed Gentiles (so read the

revelation), attack them disguised as Indians, and with the arrows of the

Almighty make a clean sweep of them, and leave none to tell the tale; and

if they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the Indians as

their allies, promising them a share of the booty.  They were to be

neither slothful nor negligent in their duty, and to be punctual in

sending the teams back to him before winter set in, for this was the

mandate of Almighty God."



The command of the "revelation" was faithfully obeyed.  A large party of

Mormons, painted and tricked out as Indians, overtook the train of

emigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City, and

made an attack.  But the emigrants threw up earthworks, made fortresses

of their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for

five days!  Your Missouri or Arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the

sort of scurvy apologies for "Indians" which the southern part of Utah

affords.  He would stand up and fight five hundred of them.



At the end of the five days the Mormons tried military strategy.  They

retired to the upper end of the "Meadows," resumed civilized apparel,

washed off their paint, and then, heavily armed, drove down in wagons to

the beleaguered emigrants, bearing a flag of truce!  When the emigrants

saw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with

cheer after cheer!  And, all unconscious of the poetry of it, no doubt,

they lifted a little child aloft, dressed in white, in answer to the flag

of truce!



The leaders of the timely white "deliverers" were President Haight and

Bishop John D. Lee, of the Mormon Church.  Mr. Cradlebaugh, who served a

term as a Federal Judge in Utah and afterward was sent to Congress from

Nevada, tells in a speech delivered in Congress how these leaders next

proceeded:



"They professed to be on good terms with the Indians, and represented

them as being very mad.  They also proposed to intercede and settle the

matter with the Indians.  After several hours parley they, having

(apparently) visited the Indians, gave the ultimatum of the savages;

which was, that the emigrants should march out of their camp, leaving

everything behind them, even their guns.  It was promised by the Mormon

bishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to the

settlements.  The terms were agreed to, the emigrants being desirous of

saving the lives of their families.  The Mormons retired, and

subsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men.  The emigrants were

marched out, the women and children in front and the men behind, the

Mormon guard being in the rear.  When they had marched in this way about

a mile, at a given signal the slaughter commenced.  The men were almost

all shot down at the first fire from the guard.  Two only escaped, who

fled to the desert, and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before

they were overtaken and slaughtered.  The women and children ran on, two

or three hundred yards further, when they were overtaken and with the aid

of the Indians they were slaughtered.  Seventeen individuals only, of all

the emigrant party, were spared, and they were little children, the

eldest of them being only seven years old.  Thus, on the 10th day of

September, 1857, was consummated one of the most cruel, cowardly and

bloody murders known in our history."



The number of persons butchered by the Mormons on this occasion was one

hundred and twenty.



With unheard-of temerity Judge Cradlebaugh opened his court and proceeded

to make Mormondom answer for the massacre.  And what a spectacle it must

have been to see this grim veteran, solitary and alone in his pride and

his pluck, glowering down on his Mormon jury and Mormon auditory,

deriding them by turns, and by turns "breathing threatenings and

slaughter!"



An editorial in the Territorial Enterprise of that day says of him and of

the occasion:



"He spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a Jackson;

but the jury failed to indict, or even report on the charges, while

threats of violence were heard in every quarter, and an attack on the

U.S. troops intimated, if he persisted in his course.



"Finding that nothing could be done with the juries, they were discharged

with a scathing rebuke from the judge.  And then, sitting as a committing

magistrate, he commenced his task alone.  He examined witnesses, made

arrests in every quarter, and created a consternation in the camps of the

saints greater than any they had ever witnessed before, since Mormondom

was born.  At last accounts terrified elders and bishops were decamping

to save their necks; and developments of the most starling character were

being made, implicating the highest Church dignitaries in the many

murders and robberies committed upon the Gentiles during the past eight

years."



Had Harney been Governor, Cradlebaugh would have been supported in his

work, and the absolute proofs adduced by him of Mormon guilt in this

massacre and in a number of previous murders, would have conferred

gratuitous coffins upon certain citizens, together with occasion to use

them.  But Cumming was the Federal Governor, and he, under a curious

pretense of impartiality, sought to screen the Mormons from the demands

of justice.  On one occasion he even went so far as to publish his

protest against the use of the U.S. troops in aid of Cradlebaugh's

proceedings.



Mrs. C. V. Waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre with

the following remark and accompanying summary of the testimony--and the

summary is concise, accurate and reliable:



"For the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of

Young and his Mormons in this transaction, the testimony is here collated

and circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to fasten

conviction upon them by 'confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ:'



"1.  The evidence of Mormons themselves, engaged in the affair, as shown

by the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy U.S.  Marshall Rodgers.



"2.  The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his

Report as Superintendent of Indian Affairs.  Also his failure to make any

allusion to it whatever from the pulpit, until several years after the

occurrence



"3.  The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon

Church and State, when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a

judicial investigation.



"4.  The failure of the Deseret News, the Church organ, and the only

paper then published in the Territory, to notice the massacre until

several months afterward, and then only to deny that Mormons were engaged

in it.



"5.  The testimony of the children saved from the massacre.



"6.  The children and the property of the emigrants found in possession

of the Mormons, and that possession traced back to the very day after the

massacre.



"7.  The statements of Indians in the neighborhood of the scene of the

massacre: these statements are shown, not only by Cradlebaugh and

Rodgers, but by a number of military officers, and by J. Forney, who was,

in 1859, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory.  To all

these were such statements freely and frequently made by the Indians.



"8.  The testimony of R. P. Campbell, Capt.  2d Dragoons, who was sent in

the Spring of 1859 to Santa Clara, to protect travelers on the road to

California and to inquire into Indian depredations."









C.

CONCERNING A FRIGHTFUL ASSASSINATION THAT WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED



If ever there was a harmless man, it is Conrad Wiegand, of Gold Hill,

Nevada.  If ever there was a gentle spirit that thought itself unfired

gunpowder and latent ruin, it is Conrad Wiegand.  If ever there was an

oyster that fancied itself a whale; or a jack-o'lantern, confined to a

swamp, that fancied itself a planet with a billion-mile orbit; or a

summer zephyr that deemed itself a hurricane, it is Conrad Wiegand.

Therefore, what wonder is it that when he says a thing, he thinks the

world listens; that when he does a thing the world stands still to look;

and that when he suffers, there is a convulsion of nature?  When I met

Conrad, he was "Superintendent of the Gold Hill Assay Office"--and he was

not only its Superintendent, but its entire force.  And he was a street

preacher, too, with a mongrel religion of his own invention, whereby he

expected to regenerate the universe.  This was years ago.  Here latterly

he has entered journalism; and his journalism is what it might be

expected to be: colossal to ear, but pigmy to the eye.  It is extravagant

grandiloquence confined to a newspaper about the size of a double letter

sheet.  He doubtless edits, sets the type, and prints his paper, all

alone; but he delights to speak of the concern as if it occupies a block

and employs a thousand men.



[Something less than two years ago, Conrad assailed several people

mercilessly in his little "People's Tribune," and got himself into

trouble.  Straightway he airs the affair in the "Territorial Enterprise,"

in a communication over his own signature, and I propose to reproduce it

here, in all its native simplicity and more than human candor.  Long as

it is, it is well worth reading, for it is the richest specimen of

journalistic literature the history of America can furnish, perhaps:]



From the Territorial Enterprise, Jan. 20, 1870.



SEEMING PLOT FOR ASSASSINATION MISCARRIED.



TO THE EDITOR OF THE ENTERPRISE: Months ago, when Mr. Sutro incidentally

exposed mining management on the Comstock, and among others roused me to

protest against its continuance, in great kindness you warned me that any

attempt by publications, by public meetings and by legislative action,

aimed at the correction of chronic mining evils in Storey County, must

entail upon me (a) business ruin, (b) the burden of all its costs, (c)

personal violence, and if my purpose were persisted in, then (d)

assassination, and after all nothing would be effected.



YOUR PROPHECY FULFILLING.

In large part at least your prophecies have been fulfilled, for (a)

assaying, which was well attended to in the Gold Hill Assay Office (of

which I am superintendent), in consequence of my publications, has been

taken elsewhere, so the President of one of the companies assures me.

With no reason assigned, other work has been taken away.  With but one or

two important exceptions, our assay business now consists simply of the

gleanings of the vicinity.  (b) Though my own personal donations to the

People's Tribune Association have already exceeded $1,500, outside of our

own numbers we have received (in money) less than $300 as contributions

and subscriptions for the journal.  (c) On Thursday last, on the main

street in Gold Hill, near noon, with neither warning nor cause assigned,

by a powerful blow I was felled to the ground, and while down I was

kicked by a man who it would seem had been led to believe that I had

spoken derogatorily of him.  By whom he was so induced to believe I am as

yet unable to say.  On Saturday last I was again assailed and beaten by a

man who first informed me why he did so, and who persisted in making his

assault even after the erroneous impression under which he also was at

first laboring had been clearly and repeatedly pointed out.  This same

man, after failing through intimidation to elicit from me the names of

our editorial contributors, against giving which he knew me to be

pledged, beat himself weary upon me with a raw hide, I not resisting, and

then pantingly threatened me with permanent disfiguring mayhem, if ever

again I should introduce his name into print, and who but a few minutes

before his attack upon me assured me that the only reason I was

"permitted" to reach home alive on Wednesday evening last (at which time

the PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE was issued) was, that he deems me only half-witted,

and be it remembered the very next morning I was knocked down and kicked

by a man who seemed to be prepared for flight.

[He sees doom impending:]



WHEN WILL THE CIRCLE JOIN?

How long before the whole of your prophecy will be fulfilled I cannot

say, but under the shadow of so much fulfillment in so short a time, and

with such threats from a man who is one of the most prominent exponents

of the San Francisco mining-ring staring me and this whole community

defiantly in the face and pointing to a completion of your augury, do you

blame me for feeling that this communication is the last I shall ever

write for the Press, especially when a sense alike of personal self-

respect, of duty to this money-oppressed and fear-ridden community, and

of American fealty to the spirit of true Liberty all command me, and each

more loudly than love of life itself, to declare the name of that

prominent man to be JOHN B. WINTERS, President of the Yellow Jacket

Company, a political aspirant and a military General?  The name of his

partially duped accomplice and abettor in this last marvelous assault, is

no other than PHILIP LYNCH, Editor and Proprietor of the Gold Hill News.



Despite the insult and wrong heaped upon me by John B. Winters, on

Saturday afternoon, only a glimpse of which I shall be able to afford

your readers, so much do I deplore clinching (by publicity) a serious

mistake of any one, man or woman, committed under natural and not self-

wrought passion, in view of his great apparent excitement at the time and

in view of the almost perfect privacy of the assault, I am far from sure

that I should not have given him space for repentance before exposing

him, were it not that he himself has so far exposed the matter as to make

it the common talk of the town that he has horsewhipped me.  That fact

having been made public, all the facts in connection need to be also, or

silence on my part would seem more than singular, and with many would be

proof either that I was conscious of some unworthy aim in publishing the

article, or else that my "non-combatant" principles are but a convenient

cloak alike of physical and moral cowardice.  I therefore shall try to

present a graphic but truthful picture of this whole affair, but shall

forbear all comments, presuming that the editors of our own journal, if

others do not, will speak freely and fittingly upon this subject in our

next number, whether I shall then be dead or living, for my death will

not stop, though it may suspend, the publication of the PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE.

[The "non-combatant" sticks to principle, but takes along a friend or two

of a conveniently different stripe:]



THE TRAP SET.

On Saturday morning John B. Winters sent verbal word to the Gold Hill

Assay Office that he desired to see me at the Yellow Jacket office.

Though such a request struck me as decidedly cool in view of his own

recent discourtesies to me there alike as a publisher and as a

stockholder in the Yellow Jacket mine, and though it seemed to me more

like a summons than the courteous request by one gentleman to another for

a favor, hoping that some conference with Sharon looking to the

betterment of mining matters in Nevada might arise from it, I felt

strongly inclined to overlook what possibly was simply an oversight in

courtesy.  But as then it had only been two days since I had been bruised

and beaten under a hasty and false apprehension of facts, my caution was

somewhat aroused.  Moreover I remembered sensitively his contemptuousness

of manner to me at my last interview in his office.  I therefore felt it

needful, if I went at all, to go accompanied by a friend whom he would

not dare to treat with incivility, and whose presence with me might

secure exemption from insult.  Accordingly I asked a neighbor to

accompany me.



THE TRAP ALMOST DETECTED.

Although I was not then aware of this fact, it would seem that previous

to my request this same neighbor had heard Dr. Zabriskie state publicly

in a saloon, that Mr. Winters had told him he had decided either to kill

or to horsewhip me, but had not finally decided on which.  My neighbor,

therefore, felt unwilling to go down with me until he had first called on

Mr. Winters alone.  He therefore paid him a visit.  From that interview

he assured me that he gathered the impression that he did not believe I

would have any difficulty with Mr. Winters, and that he (Winters) would

call on me at four o'clock in my own office.



MY OWN PRECAUTIONS.

As Sheriff Cummings was in Gold Hill that afternoon, and as I desired to

converse with him about the previous assault, I invited him to my office,

and he came.  Although a half hour had passed beyond four o'clock, Mr.

Winters had not called, and we both of us began preparing to go home.

Just then, Philip Lynch, Publisher of the Gold Hill News, came in and

said, blandly and cheerily, as if bringing good news:



"Hello, John B. Winters wants to see you."



I replied, "Indeed!  Why he sent me word that he would call on me here

this afternoon at four o'clock!"



"O, well, it don't do to be too ceremonious just now, he's in my office,

and that will do as well--come on in, Winters wants to consult with you

alone.  He's got something to say to you."



Though slightly uneasy at this change of programme, yet believing that in

an editor's house I ought to be safe, and anyhow that I would be within

hail of the street, I hurriedly, and but partially whispered my dim

apprehensions to Mr. Cummings, and asked him if he would not keep near

enough to hear my voice in case I should call.  He consented to do so

while waiting for some other parties, and to come in if he heard my voice

or thought I had need of protection.



On reaching the editorial part of the News office, which viewed from the

street is dark, I did not see Mr. Winters, and again my misgivings arose.

Had I paused long enough to consider the case, I should have invited

Sheriff Cummings in, but as Lynch went down stairs, he said: "This way,

Wiegand--it's best to be private," or some such remark.



[I do not desire to strain the reader's fancy, hurtfully, and yet it

would be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle, or

the duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committee--M.  T.:]



I followed, and without Mr. Cummings, and without arms, which I never do

or will carry, unless as a soldier in war, or unless I should yet come to

feel I must fight a duel, or to join and aid in the ranks of a necessary

Vigilance Committee.  But by following I made a fatal mistake.  Following

was entering a trap, and whatever animal suffers itself to be caught

should expect the common fate of a caged rat, as I fear events to come

will prove.



Traps commonly are not set for benevolence.

[His body-guard is shut out:]



THE TRAP INSIDE.

I followed Lynch down stairs.  At their foot a door to the left opened

into a small room.  From that room another door opened into yet another

room, and once entered I found myself inveigled into what many will ever

henceforth regard as a private subterranean Gold Hill den, admirably

adapted in proper hands to the purposes of murder, raw or disguised, for

from it, with both or even one door closed, when too late, I saw that I

could not be heard by Sheriff Cummings, and from it, BY VIOLENCE AND BY

FORCE, I was prevented from making a peaceable exit, when I thought I saw

the studious object of this "consultation" was no other than to compass

my killing, in the presence of Philip Lynch as a witness, as soon as by

insult a proverbially excitable man should be exasperated to the point of

assailing Mr. Winters, so that Mr. Lynch, by his conscience and by his

well known tenderness of heart toward the rich and potent would be

compelled to testify that he saw Gen. John B. Winters kill Conrad Wiegand

in "self-defence."  But I am going too fast.



OUR HOST.

Mr. Lynch was present during the most of the time (say a little short of

an hour), but three times he left the room.  His testimony, therefore,

would be available only as to the bulk of what transpired.  On entering

this carpeted den I was invited to a seat near one corner of the room.

Mr. Lynch took a seat near the window.  J. B. Winters sat (at first) near

the door, and began his remarks essentially as follows:



"I have come here to exact of you a retraction, in black and white, of

those damnably false charges which you have preferred against me in that-

--infamous lying sheet of yours, and you must declare yourself their

author, that you published them knowing them to be false, and that your

motives were malicious."



"Hold, Mr. Winters.  Your language is insulting and your demand an

enormity.  I trust I was not invited here either to be insulted or

coerced.  I supposed myself here by invitation of Mr. Lynch, at your

request."



"Nor did I come here to insult you.  I have already told you that I am

here for a very different purpose."



"Yet your language has been offensive, and even now shows strong

excitement.  If insult is repeated I shall either leave the room or call

in Sheriff Cummings, whom I just left standing and waiting for me outside

the door."



"No, you won't, sir.  You may just as well understand it at once as not.

Here you are my man, and I'll tell you why!  Months ago you put your

property out of your hands, boasting that you did so to escape losing it

on prosecution for libel."



"It is true that I did convert all my immovable property into personal

property, such as I could trust safely to others, and chiefly to escape

ruin through possible libel suits."



"Very good, sir.  Having placed yourself beyond the pale of the law, may

God help your soul if you DON'T make precisely such a retraction as I

have demanded.  I've got you now, and by--before you can get out of this

room you've got to both write and sign precisely the retraction I have

demanded, and before you go, anyhow--you---low-lived--lying---, I'll

teach you what personal responsibility is outside of the law; and, by--,

Sheriff Cummings and all the friends you've got in the world besides,

can't save you, you---, etc.!  No, sir.  I'm alone now, and I'm prepared

to be shot down just here and now rather than be villified by you as I

have been, and suffer you to escape me after publishing those charges,

not only here where I am known and universally respected, but where I am

not personally known and may be injured."



I confess this speech, with its terrible and but too plainly implied

threat of killing me if I did not sign the paper he demanded, terrified

me, especially as I saw he was working himself up to the highest possible

pitch of passion, and instinct told me that any reply other than one of

seeming concession to his demands would only be fuel to a raging fire,

so I replied:



"Well, if I've got to sign--," and then I paused some time.  Resuming,

I said, "But, Mr. Winters, you are greatly excited.  Besides, I see you

are laboring under a total misapprehension.  It is your duty not to

inflame but to calm yourself.  I am prepared to show you, if you will

only point out the article that you allude to, that you regard as

'charges' what no calm and logical mind has any right to regard as such.

Show me the charges, and I will try, at all events; and if it becomes

plain that no charges have been preferred, then plainly there can be

nothing to retract, and no one could rightly urge you to demand a

retraction.  You should beware of making so serious a mistake, for

however honest a man may be, every one is liable to misapprehend.

Besides you assume that I am the author of some certain article which you

have not pointed out.  It is hasty to do so."



He then pointed to some numbered paragraphs in a TRIBUNE article, headed

"What's the Matter with Yellow Jacket?" saying "That's what I refer to."



To gain time for general reflection and resolution, I took up the paper

and looked it over for awhile, he remaining silent, and as I hoped,

cooling.  I then resumed saying, "As I supposed.  I do not admit having

written that article, nor have you any right to assume so important a

point, and then base important action upon your assumption.  You might

deeply regret it afterwards.  In my published Address to the People, I

notified the world that no information as to the authorship of any

article would be given without the consent of the writer.  I therefore

cannot honorably tell you who wrote that article, nor can you exact it."



"If you are not the author, then I do demand to know who is?"



"I must decline to say."



"Then, by--, I brand you as its author, and shall treat you accordingly."



"Passing that point, the most important misapprehension which I notice

is, that you regard them as 'charges' at all, when their context, both at

their beginning and end, show they are not.  These words introduce them:

'Such an investigation [just before indicated], we think MIGHT result in

showing some of the following points.' Then follow eleven specifications,

and the succeeding paragraph shows that the suggested investigation

'might EXONERATE those who are generally believed guilty.' You see,

therefore, the context proves they are not preferred as charges, and this

you seem to have overlooked."



While making those comments, Mr. Winters frequently interrupted me in

such a way as to convince me that he was resolved not to consider

candidly the thoughts contained in my words.  He insisted upon it that

they were charges, and "By--," he would make me take them back as

charges, and he referred the question to Philip Lynch, to whom I then

appealed as a literary man, as a logician, and as an editor, calling his

attention especially to the introductory paragraph just before quoted.

He replied, "if they are not charges, they certainly are insinuations,"

whereupon Mr. Winters renewed his demands for retraction precisely such

as he had before named, except that he would allow me to state who did

write the article if I did not myself, and this time shaking his fist in

my face with more cursings and epithets.



When he threatened me with his clenched fist, instinctively I tried to

rise from my chair, but Winters then forcibly thrust me down, as he did

every other time (at least seven or eight), when under similar imminent

danger of bruising by his fist (or for aught I could know worse than that

after the first stunning blow), which he could easily and safely to

himself have dealt me so long as he kept me down and stood over me.



This fact it was, which more than anything else, convinced me that by

plan and plot I was purposely made powerless in Mr. Winters' hands, and

that he did not mean to allow me that advantage of being afoot, which he

possessed.  Moreover, I then became convinced, that Philip Lynch (and for

what reason I wondered) would do absolutely nothing to protect me in his

own house.  I realized then the situation thoroughly.  I had found it

equally vain to protest or argue, and I would make no unmanly appeal for

pity, still less apologize.  Yet my life had been by the plainest

possible implication threatened.  I was a weak man.  I was unarmed.  I

was helplessly down, and Winters was afoot and probably armed.  Lynch was

the only "witness."  The statements demanded, if given and not explained,

would utterly sink me in my own self-respect, in my family's eyes, and in

the eyes of the community.  On the other hand, should I give the author's

name how could I ever expect that confidence of the People which I should

no longer deserve, and how much dearer to me and to my family was my life

than the life of the real author to his friends.  Yet life seemed dear

and each minute that remained seemed precious if not solemn.  I sincerely

trust that neither you nor any of your readers, and especially none with

families, may ever be placed in such seeming direct proximity to death

while obliged to decide the one question I was compelled to, viz.: What

should I do--I, a man of family, and not as Mr. Winters is, "alone."

[The reader is requested not to skip the following.--M.  T.:]



STRATEGY AND MESMERISM.

To gain time for further reflection, and hoping that by a seeming

acquiescence I might regain my personal liberty, at least till I could

give an alarm, or take advantage of some momentary inadvertence of

Winters, and then without a cowardly flight escape, I resolved to write a

certain kind of retraction, but previously had inwardly decided



First.--That I would studiously avoid every action which might be

construed into the drawing of a weapon, even by a self-infuriated man, no

matter what amount of insult might be heaped upon me, for it seemed to me

that this great excess of compound profanity, foulness and epithet must

be more than a mere indulgence, and therefore must have some object.

"Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird."  Therefore,

as before without thought, I thereafter by intent kept my hands away from

my pockets, and generally in sight and spread upon my knees.



Second.--I resolved to make no motion with my arms or hands which could

possibly be construed into aggression.



Third.--I resolved completely to govern my outward manner and suppress

indignation.  To do this, I must govern my spirit.  To do that, by force

of imagination I was obliged like actors on the boards to resolve myself

into an unnatural mental state and see all things through the eyes of an

assumed character.



Fourth.--I resolved to try on Winters, silently, and unconsciously to

himself a mesmeric power which I possess over certain kinds of people,

and which at times I have found to work even in the dark over the lower

animals.



Does any one smile at these last counts?  God save you from ever being

obliged to beat in a game of chess, whose stake is your life, you having

but four poor pawns and pieces and your adversary with his full force

unshorn.  But if you are, provided you have any strength with breadth of

will, do not despair.  Though mesmeric power may not save you, it may

help you; try it at all events.  In this instance I was conscious of

power coming into me, and by a law of nature, I know Winters was

correspondingly weakened.  If I could have gained more time I am sure he

would not even have struck me.



It takes time both to form such resolutions and to recite them.  That

time, however, I gained while thinking of my retraction, which I first

wrote in pencil, altering it from time to time till I got it to suit me,

my aim being to make it look like a concession to demands, while in fact

it should tersely speak the truth into Mr. Winters' mind.  When it was

finished, I copied it in ink, and if correctly copied from my first draft

it should read as follows.  In copying I do not think I made any material

change.



COPY.

To Philip Lynch, Editor of the Gold Hill News: I learn that Gen. John B.

Winters believes the following (pasted on) clipping from the PEOPLE'S

TRIBUNE of January to contain distinct charges of mine against him

personally, and that as such he desires me to retract them unqualifiedly.



In compliance with his request, permit me to say that, although Mr.

Winters and I see this matter differently, in view of his strong feelings

in the premises, I hereby declare that I do not know those "charges" (if

such they are) to be true, and I hope that a critical examination would

altogether disprove them.

                              CONRAD WIEGAND.

                         Gold Hill, January 15, 1870.





I then read what I had written and handed it to Mr. Lynch, whereupon Mr.

Winters said:



"That's not satisfactory, and it won't do;" and then addressing himself

to Mr. Lynch, he further said: "How does it strike you?"



"Well, I confess I don't see that it retracts anything."



"Nor do I," said Winters; "in fact, I regard it as adding insult to

injury.  Mr. Wiegand you've got to do better than that.  You are not the

man who can pull wool over my eyes."



"That, sir, is the only retraction I can write."



"No it isn't, sir, and if you so much as say so again you do it at your

peril, for I'll thrash you to within an inch of your life, and, by--,

sir, I don't pledge myself to spare you even that inch either.  I want

you to understand I have asked you for a very different paper, and that

paper you've got to sign."



"Mr. Winters, I assure you that I do not wish to irritate you, but, at

the same time, it is utterly impossible for me to write any other paper

than that which I have written.  If you are resolved to compel me to sign

something, Philip Lynch's hand must write at your dictation, and if, when

written, I can sign it I will do so, but such a document as you say you

must have from me, I never can sign.  I mean what I say."



"Well, sir, what's to be done must be done quickly, for I've been here

long enough already.  I'll put the thing in another shape (and then

pointing to the paper); don't you know those charges to be false?"



"I do not."



"Do you know them to be true?"



"Of my own personal knowledge I do not."



"Why then did you print them?"



"Because rightly considered in their connection they are not charges, but

pertinent and useful suggestions in answer to the queries of a

correspondent who stated facts which are inexplicable."



"Don't you know that I know they are false?"



"If you do, the proper course is simply to deny them and court an

investigation."



"And do YOU claim the right to make ME come out and deny anything you may

choose to write and print?"



To that question I think I made no reply, and he then further said:



"Come, now, we've talked about the matter long enough.  I want your final

answer--did you write that article or not?"



"I cannot in honor tell you who wrote it."



"Did you not see it before it was printed?"



"Most certainly, sir."



"And did you deem it a fit thing to publish?"



"Most assuredly, sir, or I would never have consented to its appearance.

Of its authorship I can say nothing whatever, but for its publication I

assume full, sole and personal responsibility."



"And do you then retract it or not?"



"Mr. Winters, if my refusal to sign such a paper as you have demanded

must entail upon me all that your language in this room fairly implies,

then I ask a few minutes for prayer."



"Prayer!---you, this is not your hour for prayer--your time to pray was

when you were writing those--lying charges.  Will you sign or not?"



"You already have my answer."



"What!  do you still refuse?"



"I do, sir."



"Take that, then," and to my amazement and inexpressible relief he drew

only a rawhide instead of what I expected--a bludgeon or pistol.  With

it, as he spoke, he struck at my left ear downwards, as if to tear it

off, and afterwards on the side of the head.  As he moved away to get a

better chance for a more effective shot, for the first time I gained a

chance under peril to rise, and I did so pitying him from the very bottom

of my soul, to think that one so naturally capable of true dignity, power

and nobility could, by the temptations of this State, and by unfortunate

associations and aspirations, be so deeply debased as to find in such

brutality anything which he could call satisfaction--but the great hope

for us all is in progress and growth, and John B.  Winters, I trust, will

yet be able to comprehend my feelings.



He continued to beat me with all his great force, until absolutely weary,

exhausted and panting for breath.  I still adhered to my purpose of non-

aggressive defence, and made no other use of my arms than to defend my

head and face from further disfigurement.  The mere pain arising from the

blows he inflicted upon my person was of course transient, and my

clothing to some extent deadened its severity, as it now hides all

remaining traces.



When I supposed he was through, taking the butt end of his weapon and

shaking it in my face, he warned me, if I correctly understood him, of

more yet to come, and furthermore said, if ever I again dared introduce

his name to print, in either my own or any other public journal, he would

cut off my left ear (and I do not think he was jesting) and send me home

to my family a visibly mutilated man, to be a standing warning to all

low-lived puppies who seek to blackmail gentlemen and to injure their

good names.  And when he did so operate, he informed me that his

implement would not be a whip but a knife.



When he had said this, unaccompanied by Mr. Lynch, as I remember it, he

left the room, for I sat down by Mr. Lynch, exclaiming: "The man is mad--

he is utterly mad--this step is his ruin--it is a mistake--it would be

ungenerous in me, despite of all the ill usage I have here received, to

expose him, at least until he has had an opportunity to reflect upon the

matter.  I shall be in no haste."



"Winters is very mad just now," replied Mr. Lynch, "but when he is

himself he is one of the finest men I ever met.  In fact, he told me the

reason he did not meet you upstairs was to spare you the humiliation of a

beating in the sight of others."



I submit that that unguarded remark of Philip Lynch convicts him of

having been privy in advance to Mr. Winters' intentions whatever they may

have been, or at least to his meaning to make an assault upon me, but I

leave to others to determine how much censure an editor deserves for

inveigling a weak, non-combatant man, also a publisher, to a pen of his

own to be horsewhipped, if no worse, for the simple printing of what is

verbally in the mouth of nine out of ten men, and women too, upon the

street.



While writing this account two theories have occurred to me as possibly

true respecting this most remarkable assault:

First--The aim may have been simply to extort from me such admissions as

in the hands of money and influence would have sent me to the

Penitentiary for libel.  This, however, seems unlikely, because any

statements elicited by fear or force could not be evidence in law or

could be so explained as to have no force.  The statements wanted so

badly must have been desired for some other purpose.

Second--The other theory has so dark and wilfully murderous a look that I

shrink from writing it, yet as in all probability my death at the

earliest practicable moment has already been decreed, I feel I should do

all I can before my hour arrives, at least to show others how to break up

that aristocratic rule and combination which has robbed all Nevada of

true freedom, if not of manhood itself.  Although I do not prefer this

hypothesis as a "charge," I feel that as an American citizen I still have

a right both to think and to speak my thoughts even in the land of Sharon

and Winters, and as much so respecting the theory of a brutal assault

(especially when I have been its subject) as respecting any other

apparent enormity.  I give the matter simply as a suggestion which may

explain to the proper authorities and to the people whom they should

represent, a well ascertained but notwithstanding a darkly mysterious

fact.  The scheme of the assault may have been:



First--To terrify me by making me conscious of my own helplessness after

making actual though not legal threats against my life.



Second--To imply that I could save my life only by writing or signing

certain specific statements which if not subsequently explained would

eternally have branded me as infamous and would have consigned my family

to shame and want, and to the dreadful compassion and patronage of the

rich.



Third--To blow my brains out the moment I had signed, thereby preventing

me from making any subsequent explanation such as could remove the

infamy.



Fourth--Philip Lynch to be compelled to testify that I was killed by John

B.  Winters in self-defence, for the conviction of Winters would bring

him in as an accomplice.  If that was the programme in John B.  Winters'

mind nothing saved my life but my persistent refusal to sign, when that

refusal seemed clearly to me to be the choice of death.



The remarkable assertion made to me by Mr. Winters, that pity only spared

my life on Wednesday evening last, almost compels me to believe that at

first he could not have intended me to leave that room alive; and why I

was allowed to, unless through mesmeric or some other invisible

influence, I cannot divine.  The more I reflect upon this matter, the

more probable as true does this horrible interpretation become.



The narration of these things I might have spared both to Mr. Winters and

to the public had he himself observed silence, but as he has both

verbally spoken and suffered a thoroughly garbled statement of facts to

appear in the Gold Hill News I feel it due to myself no less than to this

community, and to the entire independent press of America and Great

Britain, to give a true account of what even the Gold Hill News has

pronounced a disgraceful affair, and which it deeply regrets because of

some alleged telegraphic mistake in the account of it.  [Who received the

erroneous telegrams?]



Though he may not deem it prudent to take my life just now, the

publication of this article I feel sure must compel Gen. Winters (with

his peculiar views about his right to exemption from criticism by me) to

resolve on my violent death, though it may take years to compass it.

Notwithstanding I bear him no ill will; and if W. C. Ralston and William

Sharon, and other members of the San Francisco mining and milling Ring

feel that he above all other men in this State and California is the most

fitting man to supervise and control Yellow Jacket matters, until I am

able to vote more than half their stock I presume he will be retained to

grace his present post.



Meantime, I cordially invite all who know of any sort of important

villainy which only can be cured by exposure (and who would expose it if

they felt sure they would not be betrayed under bullying threats), to

communicate with the PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE; for until I am murdered, so long

as I can raise the means to publish, I propose to continue my efforts at

least to revive the liberties of the State, to curb oppression, and to

benefit man's world and God's earth.

                              CONRAD WIEGAND.





[It does seem a pity that the Sheriff was shut out, since the good sense

of a general of militia and of a prominent editor failed to teach them

that the merited castigation of this weak, half-witted child was a thing

that ought to have been done in the street, where the poor thing could

have a chance to run.  When a journalist maligns a citizen, or attacks

his good name on hearsay evidence, he deserves to be thrashed for it,

even if he is a "non-combatant" weakling; but a generous adversary would

at least allow such a lamb the use of his legs at such a time.--M.  T.]

THE GILDED AGE



A Tale of Today



by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner



1873







PREFACE.



This book was not written for private circulation among friends; it was

not written to cheer and instruct a diseased relative of the author's;

it was not thrown off during intervals of wearing labor to amuse an idle

hour.  It was not written for any of these reasons, and therefore it is

submitted without the usual apologies.



It will be seen that it deals with an entirely ideal state of society;

and the chief embarrassment of the writers in this realm of the

imagination has been the want of illustrative examples.  In a State where

there is no fever of speculation, no inflamed desire for sudden wealth,

where the poor are all simple-minded and contented, and the rich are all

honest and generous, where society is in a condition of primitive purity

and politics is the occupation of only the capable and the patriotic,

there are necessarily no materials for such a history as we have

constructed out of an ideal commonwealth.



No apology is needed for following the learned custom of placing

attractive scraps of literature at the heads of our chapters.  It has

been truly observed by Wagner that such headings, with their vague

suggestions of the matter which is to follow them, pleasantly inflame the

reader's interest without wholly satisfying his curiosity, and we will

hope that it may be found to be so in the present case.



Our quotations are set in a vast number of tongues; this is done for the

reason that very few foreign nations among whom the book will circulate

can read in any language but their own; whereas we do not write for a

particular class or sect or nation, but to take in the whole world.



We do not object to criticism; and we do not expect that the critic will

read the book before writing a notice of it: We do not even expect the

reviewer of the book will say that he has not read it.  No, we have no

anticipations of anything unusual in this age of criticism.  But if the

Jupiter, Who passes his opinion on the novel, ever happens to peruse it

in some weary moment of his subsequent life, we hope that he will not be

the victim of a remorse bitter but too late.



One word more.  This is--what it pretends to be a joint production, in

the conception of the story, the exposition of the characters, and in its

literal composition.  There is scarcely a chapter that does not bear the

marks of the two writers of the book.   S. L. C.

CHAPTER I.



June 18--.  Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called

the "stile," in front of his house, contemplating the morning.



The locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee.  You would not know that

Obedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about the

landscape to indicate it--but it did: a mountain that stretched abroad

over whole counties, and rose very gradually.  The district was called

the "Knobs of East Tennessee," and had a reputation like Nazareth, as far

as turning out any good thing was concerned.



The Squire's house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two or

three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their heads

sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their

bodies.  Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a bench stood

near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a

gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the exertion was

overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest.  There was an ash-

hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling, near it.



This dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen

houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the corn-

fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and

not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes

for information.



"Squire" Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown--not

that the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those

regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so

the usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins.  The mail was monthly,

and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single

delivery.  Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster's whole

month, though, and therefore he "kept store" in the intervals.



The Squire was contemplating the morning.  It was balmy and tranquil,

the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of

bees was in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that

summer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable

melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.



Presently the United States mail arrived, on horseback.  There was but

one letter, and it was for the postmaster.  The long-legged youth who

carried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in

a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help.

As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun "jeans," blue or

yellow--here were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and

sometimes two--yarn ones knitted at home,--some wore vests, but few wore

coats.  Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather

picturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful

patterns of calico--a fashion which prevails thereto this day among those

of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to

afford style.  Every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets;

a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went back again

after service; and if it was the head that was served, just the cant that

the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under, was

retained until the next call altered the inclination; many' hats were

present, but none were erect and no two were canted just alike.  We are

speaking impartially of men, youths and boys.  And we are also speaking

of these three estates when we say that every individual was either

chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or smoking the

same in a corn-cob pipe.  Few of the men wore whiskers; none wore

moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the

throat--the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in

whiskers; but no part of any individual's face had seen a razor for a

week.



These neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier

reflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself,

and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the

fence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled

for supper and listening for the death-rattle.  Old Damrell said:



"Tha hain't no news 'bout the jedge, hit ain't likely?"



"Cain't tell for sartin; some thinks he's gwyne to be 'long toreckly,

and some thinks 'e hain't.  Russ Mosely he tote ole Hanks he mought git

to Obeds tomorrer or nex' day he reckoned."



"Well, I wisht I knowed.  I got a 'prime sow and pigs in the, cote-house,

and I hain't got no place for to put 'em.  If the jedge is a gwyne to

hold cote, I got to roust 'em out, I reckon.  But tomorrer'll do, I

'spect."



The speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a tomato

and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away.

One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice

and delivered it at the deceased with steady, aim and faultless accuracy.



"What's a stirrin', down 'bout the Forks?" continued Old Damrell.



"Well, I dunno, skasely.  Ole, Drake Higgins he's ben down to Shelby las'

week.  Tuck his crap down; couldn't git shet o' the most uv it; hit

wasn't no time for to sell, he say, so he 'fotch it back agin, 'lowin' to

wait tell fall.  Talks 'bout goin' to Mozouri--lots uv 'ems talkin' that-

away down thar, Ole Higgins say.  Cain't make a livin' here no mo', sich

times as these.  Si Higgins he's ben over to Kaintuck n' married a high-

toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an' he's come back to the Forks

with jist a hell's-mint o' whoop-jamboree notions, folks says.  He's tuck

an' fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say, an' tha's

ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it.  He's tuck an gawmed

it all over on the inside with plarsterin'."



"What's plasterin'?"



"I dono.  Hit's what he calls it.  'Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me.

She say she wasn't gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog.

Says it's mud, or some sich kind o' nastiness that sticks on n' covers up

everything.  Plarsterin', Si calls it."



This marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with

animation.  But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood

of the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so

many turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering on

eagerness.  The Squire remained, and read his letter.  Then he sighed,

and sat long in meditation.  At intervals he said:



Missouri.  Missouri.  Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain."



At last he said:



"I believe I'll do it.--A man will just rot, here.  My house my yard,

everything around me, in fact, shows' that I am becoming one of these

cattle--and I used to be thrifty in other times."



He was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him

seem older.  He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was

the store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of

beeswax, to an old dame in linsey-woolsey, put his letter away, an went

into the kitchen.  His wife was there, constructing some dried apple

pies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of

his own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was

sopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and

trying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through

the middle--for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings

made him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy

cooking, at a vast fire-place.  Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the

place.



"Nancy, I've made up my mind.  The world is done with me, and perhaps I

ought to be done with it.  But no matter--I can wait.  I am going to

Missouri.  I won't stay in this dead country and decay with it.  I've had

it on my mind sometime.  I'm going to sell out here for whatever I can

get, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and

start."



"Anywhere that suits you, suits me, Si.  And the children can't be any

worse off in Missouri than, they are here, I reckon."



Motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins

said: "No, they'll be better off.  I've looked out for them, Nancy," and

his face lighted.  "Do you see these papers?  Well, they are evidence

that I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this county-

think what an enormous fortune it will be some day!  Why, Nancy, enormous

don't express it--the word's too tame!  I tell your Nancy----"



"For goodness sake, Si----"



"Wait, Nancy, wait--let me finish--I've been secretly bailing and fuming

with this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I'll burst!

I haven't whispered to a soul--not a word--have had my countenance under

lock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even these

animals here how to discern the gold mine that's glaring under their

noses.  Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the

family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly--five or ten dollars--

the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now,

but some day people wild be glad to get it for twenty dollars, fifty

dollars, a hundred dollars an acre!  What should you say to" [here he

dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that

there were no eavesdroppers,] "a thousand dollars an acre!



"Well you may open your eyes and stare!  But it's so.  You and I may not

see the day, but they'll see it.  Mind I tell you; they'll see it.

Nancy, you've heard of steamboats, and maybe you believed in them--of

course you did.  You've heard these cattle here scoff at them and call

them lies and humbugs,--but they're not lies and humbugs, they're a

reality and they're going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they

are now.  They're going to make a revolution in this world's affairs that

will make men dizzy to contemplate.  I've been watching--I've been

watching while some people slept, and I know what's coming.



"Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little

Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours--and in high

water they'll come right to it!  And this is not all, Nancy--it isn't

even half!  There's a bigger wonder--the railroad!  These worms here have

never even heard of it--and when they do they'll not believe in it.

But it's another fact.  Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an

hour--heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy!  Twenty miles an hour.

It makes a main's brain whirl.  Some day, when you and I are in our

graves, there'll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles--all the way

down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans--and its got

to run within thirty miles of this land--may be even touch a corner of

it.  Well; do you know, they've quit burning wood in some places in the

Eastern States?  And what do you suppose they burn?  Coal!" [He bent over

and whispered again:] "There's world--worlds of it on this land!  You

know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?--well,

that's it.  You've taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and

they've built little dams and such things with it.  One man was going to

build a chimney out of it.  Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet!

Why, it might have caught fire and told everything.  I showed him it was

too crumbly.  Then he was going to build it of copper ore--splendid

yellow forty-per-cent. ore!  There's fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore

on our land!  It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting a

smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his dull

eyes opened.  And then he was going to build it of iron ore!  There's

mountains of iron ore here, Nancy--whole mountains of it.  I wouldn't

take any chances.  I just stuck by him--I haunted him--I never let him

alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the

chimneys in this dismal country.  Pine forests, wheat land, corn land,

iron, copper, coal-wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats!

We'll never see the day, Nancy--never in the world---never, never, never,

child.  We've got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and

poverty, all hopeless and forlorn--but they'll ride in coaches, Nancy!

They'll live like the princes of the earth; they'll be courted and

worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean!  Ah, well-a-

day!  Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the steamboat,

and say, 'This one little spot shall not be touched--this hovel shall be

sacred--for here our father and our mother suffered for us, thought for

us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills!'"



"You are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored woman

to be the wife of such a man"--and the tears stood in her eyes when she

said it.  "We will go to Missouri.  You are out of your place, here,

among these groping dumb creatures.  We will find a higher place, where

you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you speak--not

stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue.  I would go

anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you I would rather my body

would starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this

lonely land."



"Spoken like yourself, my child!  But we'll not starve, Nancy.  Far from

it.  I have a letter from Beriah Sellers--just came this day.  A letter

that--I'll read you a line from it!"



He flew out of the room.  A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy's face--

there was uneasiness in it, and disappointment.  A procession of

disturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind.  Saying nothing

aloud, she sat with her hands in her lap; now and then she clasped them,

then unclasped them, then tapped the ends of the fingers together;

sighed, nodded, smiled--occasionally paused, shook her head.  This

pantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which

had something of this shape:



"I was afraid of it--was afraid of it.  Trying to make our fortune in

Virginia, Beriah Sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in

Kentucky and start over again.  Trying to make our fortune in Kentucky he

crippled us again and we had to move here.  Trying to make our fortune

here, he brought us clear down to the ground, nearly.  He's an honest

soul, and means the very best in the world, but I'm afraid, I'm afraid

he's too flighty.  He has splendid ideas, and he'll divide his chances

with his friends with a free hand, the good generous soul, but something

does seem to always interfere and spoil everything.  I never did think he

was right well balanced.  But I don't blame my husband, for I do think

that when that man gets his head full of a new notion, he can out-talk a

machine.  He'll make anybody believe in that notion that'll listen to him

ten minutes--why I do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe

in it and get beside himself, if you only set him where he could see his

eyes tally and watch his hands explain.  What a head he has got!  When he

got up that idea there in Virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes in

Delaware and Virginia and Tennessee, very quiet, having papers drawn to

have them delivered at a place in Alabama and take them and pay for them,

away yonder at a certain time, and then in the meantime get a law made

stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a certain day

--it was somehow that way--mercy how the man would have made money!

Negroes would have gone up to four prices.  But after he'd spent money

and worked hard, and traveled hard, and had heaps of negroes all

contracted for, and everything going along just right, he couldn't get

the laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled.  And there in Kentucky,

when he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a

perpetual motion machine for twenty-two years, and Beriah Sellers saw at

a glance where just one more little cog-wheel would settle the business,

why I could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and

hammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the

doors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel.  Oceans of money in it-

anybody could see that.  But it did cost a deal to buy the old numskull

out--and then when they put the new cog wheel in they'd overlooked

something somewhere and it wasn't any use--the troublesome thing wouldn't

go.  That notion he got up here did look as handy as anything in the

world; and how him and Si did sit up nights working at it with the

curtains down and me watching to see if any neighbors were about.  The

man did honestly believe there was a fortune in that black gummy oil that

stews out of the bank Si says is coal; and he refined it himself till it

was like water, nearly, and it did burn, there's no two ways about that;

and I reckon he'd have been all right in Cincinnati with his lamp that he

got made, that time he got a house full of rich speculators to see him

exhibit only in the middle of his speech it let go and almost blew the

heads off the whole crowd.  I haven't got over grieving for the money

that cost yet.  I am sorry enough Beriah Sellers is in Missouri, now, but

I was glad when he went.  I wonder what his letter says.  But of course

it's cheerful; he's never down-hearted--never had any trouble in his

life--didn't know it if he had.  It's always sunrise with that man, and

fine and blazing, at that--never gets noon; though--leaves off and rises

again.  Nobody can help liking the creature, he means so well--but I do

dread to come across him again; he's bound to set us all crazy, of

coarse.  Well, there goes old widow Hopkins--it always takes her a week

to buy a spool of thread and trade a hank of yarn.  Maybe Si can come

with the letter, now."



And he did:



"Widow Hopkins kept me--I haven't any patience with such tedious people.

Now listen, Nancy--just listen at this:



     "'Come right along to Missouri!  Don't wait and worry about a good

     price but sell out for whatever you can get, and come along, or you

     might be too late.  Throw away your traps, if necessary, and come

     empty-handed.  You'll never regret it.  It's the grandest country--

     the loveliest land--the purest atmosphere--I can't describe it; no

     pen can do it justice.  And it's filling up, every day--people

     coming from everywhere.  I've got the biggest scheme on earth--and

     I'll take you in; I'll take in every friend I've got that's ever

     stood by me, for there's enough for all, and to spare.  Mum's the

     word--don't whisper--keep yourself to yourself.  You'll see!  Come!

     --rush!--hurry!--don't wait for anything!'



"It's the same old boy, Nancy, jest the same old boy--ain't he?"



"Yes, I think there's a little of the old sound about his voice yet.

I suppose you--you'll still go, Si?"



"Go!  Well, I should think so, Nancy.  It's all a chance, of course, and,

chances haven't been kind to us, I'll admit--but whatever comes, old

wife, they're provided for.  Thank God for that!"



"Amen," came low and earnestly.



And with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered Obedstown and

almost took its breath away, the Hawkinses hurried through with their

arrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great

mysterious blank that lay beyond the Knobs of Tennessee.









CHAPTER II.



Toward the close of the third day's journey the wayfarers were just

beginning to think of camping, when they came upon a log cabin in the

woods.  Hawkins drew rein and entered the yard.  A boy about ten years

old was sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands.

Hawkins approached, expecting his footfall to attract attention, but it

did not.  He halted a moment, and then said:



"Come, come, little chap, you mustn't be going to sleep before sundown"



With a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands,--a face

down which tears were flowing.



"Ah, I'm sorry I spoke so, my boy.  Tell me--is anything the matter?"



The boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble

was in the, house, and made room for Hawkins to pass.  Then he put his

face in his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a grief

that is too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry.  Hawkins

stepped within.  It was a poverty stricken place.  Six or eight middle-

aged country people of both sexes were grouped about an object in the

middle of the room; they were noiselessly busy and they talked in

whispers when they spoke.  Hawkins uncovered and approached.  A coffin

stood upon two backless chairs.  These neighbors had just finished

disposing the body of a woman in it--a woman with a careworn, gentle face

that had more the look of sleep about it than of death.  An old lady

motioned, toward the door and said to Hawkins in a whisper:



"His mother, po' thing.  Died of the fever, last night.  Tha warn't no

sich thing as saving of her.  But it's better for her--better for her.

Husband and the other two children died in the spring, and she hain't

ever hilt up her head sence.  She jest went around broken-hearted like,

and never took no intrust in anything but Clay--that's the boy thar.

She jest worshiped Clay--and Clay he worshiped her.  They didn't 'pear to

live at all, only when they was together, looking at each other, loving

one another.  She's ben sick three weeks; and if you believe me that

child has worked, and kep' the run of the med'cin, and the times of

giving it, and sot up nights and nussed her, and tried to keep up her

sperits, the same as a grown-up person.  And last night when she kep' a

sinking and sinking, and turned away her head and didn't know him no mo',

it was fitten to make a body's heart break to see him climb onto the bed

and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not answer.

But bymeby she roused up, like, and looked around wild, and then she see

him, and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and hilt him

close and kissed him over and over agin; but it took the last po'

strength she had, and so her eyelids begin to close down, and her arms

sort o' drooped away and then we see she was gone, po' creetur.  And

Clay, he--Oh, the po' motherless thing--I cain't talk abort it--I cain't

bear to talk about it."



Clay had disappeared from the door; but he came in, now, and the

neighbors reverently fell apart and made way for him.  He leaned upon the

open coffin and let his tears course silently.  Then he put out his small

hand and smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly.  After a

bit he brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or four

fresh wild flowers upon the breast, bent over and kissed the unresponsive

lips time and time again, and then turned away and went out of the house

without looking at any of the company.  The old lady said to Hawkins:



"She always loved that kind o' flowers.  He fetched 'em for her every

morning, and she always kissed him.  They was from away north somers--she

kep' school when she fust come.  Goodness knows what's to become o' that

po' boy.  No father, no mother, no kin folks of no kind.  Nobody to go

to, nobody that k'yers for him--and all of us is so put to it for to get

along and families so large."



Hawkins understood.  All, eyes were turned inquiringly upon him.  He

said:



"Friends, I am not very well provided for, myself, but still I would not

turn my back on a homeless orphan.  If he will go with me I will give him

a home, and loving regard--I will do for him as I would have another do

for a child of my own in misfortune."



One after another the people stepped forward and wrung the stranger's

hand with cordial good will, and their eyes looked all that their hands

could not express or their lips speak.



"Said like a true man," said one.



"You was a stranger to me a minute ago, but you ain't now," said another.



"It's bread cast upon the waters--it'll return after many days," said the

old lady whom we have heard speak before.



"You got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here," said one.

"If tha hain't room for you and yourn my tribe'll turn out and camp in

the hay loft."



A few minutes afterward, while the preparations for the funeral were

being concluded, Mr. Hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little waif

by the hand, and told his wife all that had happened, and asked her if he

had done right in giving to her and to himself this new care?  She said:



"If you've done wrong, Si Hawkins, it's a wrong that will shine brighter

at the judgment day than the rights that many' a man has done before you.

And there isn't any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing like

this and finishing it up, just taking it for granted that I'll be willing

to it.  Willing?  Come to me; you poor motherless boy, and let me take

your grief and help you carry it."



When the child awoke in the morning, it was as if from a troubled dream.

But slowly the confusion in his mind took form, and he remembered his

great loss; the beloved form in the coffin; his talk with a generous

stranger who offered him a home; the funeral, where the stranger's wife

held him by the hand at the grave, and cried with him and comforted him;

and he remembered how this, new mother tucked him in his bed in the

neighboring farm house, and coaxed him to talk about his troubles, and

then heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night, and left him

with the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at

rest.



And now the new mother came again, and helped him to dress, and combed

his hair, and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday,

by telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the

strange things he was going to see.  And after breakfast they two went

alone to the grave, and his heart went out to his new friend and his

untaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears

without let or hindrance.  Together they planted roses by the headboard

and strewed wild flowers upon the grave; and then together they went

away, hand in hand, and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all

heart-aches and ends all sorrows.









CHAPTER III.



Whatever the lagging dragging journey may have been to the rest of the

emigrants, it was a wonder and delight to the children, a world of

enchantment; and they believed it to be peopled with the mysterious

dwarfs and giants and goblins that figured in the tales the negro slaves

were in the habit of telling them nightly by the shuddering light of the

kitchen fire.



At the end of nearly a week of travel, the party went into camp near a

shabby village which was caving, house by house, into the hungry

Mississippi.  The river astonished the children beyond measure.  Its

mile-breadth of water seemed an ocean to them, in the shadowy twilight,

and the vague riband of trees on the further shore, the verge of a

continent which surely none but they had ever seen before.



"Uncle Dan'l"(colored,) aged 40; his wife, "aunt Jinny," aged 30, "Young

Miss" Emily Hawkins, "Young Mars" Washington Hawkins and "Young Mars"

Clay, the new member of the family, ranged themselves on a log, after

supper, and contemplated the marvelous river and discussed it.  The moon

rose and sailed aloft through a maze of shredded cloud-wreaths; the

sombre river just perceptibly brightened under the veiled light; a deep

silence pervaded the air and was emphasized, at intervals, rather than

broken, by the hooting of an owl, the baying of a dog, or the muffled

crash of a raving bank in the distance.



The little company assembled on the log were all children (at least in

simplicity and broad and comprehensive ignorance,) and the remarks they

made about the river were in keeping with the character; and so awed were

they by the grandeur and the solemnity of the scene before then, and by

their belief that the air was filled with invisible spirits and that the

faint zephyrs were caused by their passing wings, that all their talk

took to itself a tinge of the supernatural, and their voices were subdued

to a low and reverent tone.  Suddenly Uncle Dan'l exclaimed:



"Chil'en, dah's sum fin a comin!"



All crowded close together and every heart beat faster.



Uncle Dan'l pointed down the river with his bony finger.



A deep coughing sound troubled the stillness, way toward a wooded cape

that jetted into the stream a mile distant.  All in an instant a fierce

eye of fire shot out froth behind the cape and sent a long brilliant

pathway quivering athwart the dusky water.  The coughing grew louder and

louder, the glaring eye grew larger and still larger, glared wilder and

still wilder.  A huge shape developed itself out of the gloom, and from

its tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke, starred and spangled

with sparks, poured out and went tumbling away into the farther darkness.

Nearer and nearer the thing came, till its long sides began to glow with

spots of light which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the

monster like a torchlight procession.



"What is it!  Oh, what is it, Uncle Dan'l!"



With deep solemnity the answer came:



"It's de Almighty!  Git down on yo' knees!"



It was not necessary to say it twice.  They were all kneeling, in a

moment.  And then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and

stronger and the threatening glare reached farther and wider, the negro's

voice lifted up its supplications:



"O Lord', we's ben mighty wicked, an' we knows dat we 'zerve to go to de

bad place, but good Lord, deah Lord, we ain't ready yit, we ain't ready--

let dese po' chilen hab one mo' chance, jes' one mo' chance.  Take de ole

niggah if you's, got to hab somebody.--Good Lord, good deah Lord, we

don't know whah you's a gwyne to, we don't know who you's got yo' eye on,

but we knows by de way you's a comin', we knows by de way you's a tiltin'

along in yo' charyot o' fiah dat some po' sinner's a gwyne to ketch it.

But good Lord, dose chilen don't b'long heah, dey's f'm Obedstown whah

dey don't know nuffin, an' you knows, yo' own sef, dat dey ain't

'sponsible.  An' deah Lord, good Lord, it ain't like yo' mercy, it ain't

like yo' pity, it ain't like yo' long-sufferin' lovin' kindness for to

take dis kind o' 'vantage o' sick little chil'en as dose is when dey's so

many ornery grown folks chuck full o' cussedness dat wants roastin' down

dah.  Oh, Lord, spah de little chil'en, don't tar de little chil'en away

f'm dey frens, jes' let 'em off jes' dis once, and take it out'n de ole

nibgah.  HEAH I IS, LORD, HEAH I IS!  De ole niggah's ready, Lord,

de ole----"



The flaming and churning steamer was right abreast the party, and not

twenty steps away.  The awful thunder of a mud-valve suddenly burst

forth, drowning the prayer, and as suddenly Uncle Dan'l snatched a child

under each arm and scoured into the woods with the rest of the pack at

his heels.  And then, ashamed of himself, he halted in the deep darkness

and shouted, (but rather feebly:)



"Heah I is, Lord, heah I is!"



There was a moment of throbbing suspense, and then, to the surprise and

the comfort of the party, it was plain that the august presence had gone

by, for its dreadful noises were receding.  Uncle Dan'l headed a cautious

reconnaissance in the direction of the log.  Sure enough "the Lord" was

just turning a point a short distance up the river, and while they looked

the lights winked out and the coughing diminished by degrees and

presently ceased altogether.



"H'wsh!  Well now dey's some folks says dey ain't no 'ficiency in prah.

Dis Chile would like to know whah we'd a ben now if it warn't fo' dat

prah?  Dat's it.  Dat's it!"



"Uncle Dan'l, do you reckon it was the prayer that saved us?" said Clay.



"Does I reckon?  Don't I know it!  Whah was yo' eyes?  Warn't de Lord

jes' a cumin' chow!  chow!  CHOW!  an' a goin' on turrible--an' do de

Lord carry on dat way 'dout dey's sumfin don't suit him?  An' warn't he a

lookin' right at dis gang heah, an' warn't he jes' a reachin' for 'em?

An' d'you spec' he gwyne to let 'em off 'dout somebody ast him to do it?

No indeedy!"



"Do you reckon he saw, us, Uncle Dan'l?



"De law sakes, Chile, didn't I see him a lookin' at us?".



"Did you feel scared, Uncle Dan'l?"



"No sah!  When a man is 'gaged in prah, he ain't fraid o' nuffin--dey

can't nuffin tetch him."



"Well what did you run for?"



"Well, I--I--mars Clay, when a man is under de influence ob de sperit,

he do-no, what he's 'bout--no sah; dat man do-no what he's 'bout.  You

mout take an' tah de head off'n dat man an' he wouldn't scasely fine it

out.  Date's de Hebrew chil'en dat went frough de fiah; dey was burnt

considable--ob coase dey was; but dey didn't know nuffin 'bout it--heal

right up agin; if dey'd ben gals dey'd missed dey long haah, (hair,)

maybe, but dey wouldn't felt de burn."



"I don't know but what they were girls.  I think they were."



"Now mars Clay, you knows bettern dat.  Sometimes a body can't tell

whedder you's a sayin' what you means or whedder you's a sayin' what you

don't mean, 'case you says 'em bofe de same way."



"But how should I know whether they were boys or girls?"



"Goodness sakes, mars Clay, don't de Good Book say?  'Sides, don't it

call 'em de HE-brew chil'en?  If dey was gals wouldn't dey be de SHE-brew

chil'en?  Some people dat kin read don't 'pear to take no notice when dey

do read."



"Well, Uncle Dan'l, I think that-----My!  here comes another one up the

river!  There can't be two!"



"We gone dis time--we done gone dis time, sho'!  Dey ain't two, mars

Clay--days de same one.  De Lord kin 'pear eberywhah in a second.

Goodness, how do fiah and de smoke do belch up!  Dat mean business,

honey.  He comin' now like he fo'got sumfin.  Come 'long, chil'en, time

you's gwyne to roos'.  Go 'long wid you--ole Uncle Daniel gwyne out in de

woods to rastle in prah--de ole nigger gwyne to do what he kin to sabe

you agin"



He did go to the woods and pray; but he went so far that he doubted,

himself, if the Lord heard him when He went by.









CHAPTER IV.



--Seventhly, Before his Voyage, He should make his peace with God,

satisfie his Creditors if he be in debt; Pray earnestly to God to prosper

him in his Voyage, and to keep him from danger, and, if he be 'sui juris'

he should make his last will, and wisely order all his affairs, since

many that go far abroad, return not home.  (This good and Christian

Counsel is given by Martinus Zeilerus in his Apodemical Canons before his

Itinerary of Spain and Portugal.)





Early in the morning Squire Hawkins took passage in a small steamboat,

with his family and his two slaves, and presently the bell rang, the

stage-plank; was hauled in, and the vessel proceeded up the river.

The children and the slaves were not much more at ease after finding out

that this monster was a creature of human contrivance than they were the

night before when they thought it the Lord of heaven and earth.  They

started, in fright, every time the gauge-cocks sent out an angry hiss,

and they quaked from head to foot when the mud-valves thundered.  The

shivering of the boat under the beating of the wheels was sheer misery to

them.



But of course familiarity with these things soon took away their terrors,

and then the voyage at once became a glorious adventure, a royal progress

through the very heart and home of romance, a realization of their

rosiest wonder-dreams.  They sat by the hour in the shade of the pilot

house on the hurricane deck and looked out over the curving expanses of

the river sparkling in the sunlight.  Sometimes the boat fought the mid-

stream current, with a verdant world on either hand, and remote from

both; sometimes she closed in under a point, where the dead water and the

helping eddies were, and shaved the bank so closely that the decks were

swept by the jungle of over-hanging willows and littered with a spoil of

leaves; departing from these "points" she regularly crossed the river

every five miles, avoiding the "bight" of the great binds and thus

escaping the strong current; sometimes she went out and skirted a high

"bluff" sand-bar in the middle of the stream, and occasionally followed

it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal water at its head--and

then the intelligent craft refused to run herself aground, but "smelt"

the bar, and straightway the foamy streak that streamed away from her

bows vanished, a great foamless wave rolled forward and passed her under

way, and in this instant she leaned far over on her side, shied from the

bar and fled square away from the danger like a frightened thing--and the

pilot was lucky if he managed to "straighten her up" before she drove her

nose into the opposite bank; sometimes she approached a solid wall of

tall trees as if she meant to break through it, but all of a sudden a

little crack would open just enough to admit her, and away she would go

plowing through the "chute" with just barely room enough between the

island on one side and the main land on the other; in this sluggish water

she seemed to go like a racehorse; now and then small log cabins appeared

in little clearings, with the never-failing frowsy women and girls in

soiled and faded linsey-woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles

and rail fences, gazing sleepily at the passing show; sometimes she found

shoal water, going out at the head of those "chutes" or crossing the

river, and then a deck-hand stood on the bow and hove the lead, while the

boat slowed down and moved cautiously; sometimes she stopped a moment at

a landing and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of

slouchy white men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on

with their hands in their pantaloons pockets,--of course--for they never

took them out except to stretch, and when they did this they squirmed

about and reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on

tip-toe in an ecstasy of enjoyment.



When the sun went down it turned all the broad river to a national banner

laid in gleaming bars of gold and purple and crimson; and in time these

glories faded out in the twilight and left the fairy archipelagoes

reflecting their fringing foliage in the steely mirror of the stream.



At night the boat forged on through the deep solitudes of the river,

hardly ever discovering a light to testify to a human presence--mile

after mile and league after league the vast bends were guarded by

unbroken walls of forest that had never been disturbed by the voice or

the foot-fall of man or felt the edge of his sacrilegious axe.



An hour after supper the moon came up, and Clay and Washington ascended

to the hurricane deck to revel again in their new realm of enchantment.

They ran races up and down the deck; climbed about the bell; made friends

with the passenger-dogs chained under the lifeboat; tried to make friends

with a passenger-bear fastened to the verge-staff but were not

encouraged; "skinned the cat" on the hog-chains; in a word, exhausted the

amusement-possibilities of the deck.  Then they looked wistfully up at

the pilot house, and finally, little by little, Clay ventured up there,

followed diffidently by Washington.  The pilot turned presently to "get

his stern-marks," saw the lads and invited them in.  Now their happiness

was complete.  This cosy little house, built entirely of glass and

commanding a marvelous prospect in every direction was a magician's

throne to them and their enjoyment of the place was simply boundless.



They sat them down on a high bench and looked miles ahead and saw the

wooded capes fold back and reveal the bends beyond; and they looked miles

to the rear and saw the silvery highway diminish its breadth by degrees

and close itself together in the distance.  Presently the pilot said:



"By George, yonder comes the Amaranth!"



A spark appeared, close to the water, several miles down the river.  The

pilot took his glass and looked at it steadily for a moment, and said,

chiefly to himself:



"It can't be the Blue Wing.  She couldn't pick us up this way.  It's the

Amaranth, sure!"



He bent over a speaking tube and said:



"Who's on watch down there?"



A hollow, unhuman voice rumbled up through the tube in answer:



"I am.  Second engineer."



"Good!  You want to stir your stumps, now, Harry--the Amaranth's just

turned the point--and she's just a--humping herself, too!"



The pilot took hold of a rope that stretched out forward, jerked it

twice, and two mellow strokes of the big bell responded.  A voice out on

the deck shouted:



"Stand by, down there, with that labboard lead!"



"No, I don't want the lead," said the pilot, "I want you.  Roust out the

old man--tell him the Amaranth's coming.  And go and call Jim--tell him."



"Aye-aye, sir!"



The "old man" was the captain--he is always called so, on steamboats and

ships; "Jim" was the other pilot.  Within two minutes both of these men

were flying up the pilothouse stairway, three steps at a jump.  Jim was

in his shirt sleeves,--with his coat and vest on his arm.  He said:



"I was just turning in.  Where's the glass"



He took it and looked:



"Don't appear to be any night-hawk on the jack-staff--it's the Amaranth,

dead sure!"



The captain took a good long look, and only said:



"Damnation!"



George Davis, the pilot on watch, shouted to the night-watchman on deck:



"How's she loaded?"



"Two inches by the head, sir."



"'T ain't enough!"



The captain shouted, now:



"Call the mate.  Tell him to call all hands and get a lot of that sugar

forrard--put her ten inches by the head.  Lively, now!"



"Aye-aye, sir."



A riot of shouting and trampling floated up from below, presently, and

the uneasy steering of the boat soon showed that she was getting "down by

the head."



The three men in the pilot house began to talk in short, sharp sentences,

low and earnestly.  As their excitement rose, their voices went down.

As fast as one of them put down the spy-glass another took it up--but

always with a studied air of calmness.  Each time the verdict was:



"She's a gaining!"



The captain spoke through the tube:



"What steam are You carrying?"



"A hundred and forty-two, sir!  But she's getting hotter and hotter all

the time."



The boat was straining and groaning and quivering like a monster in pain.

Both pilots were at work now, one on each side of the wheel, with their

coats and vests off, their bosoms and collars wide open and the

perspiration flowing down heir faces.  They were holding the boat so

close to the shore that the willows swept the guards almost from stem to

stern.



"Stand by!" whispered George.



"All ready!" said Jim, under his breath.



"Let her come!"



The boat sprang away, from the bank like a deer, and darted in a long

diagonal toward the other shore.  She closed in again and thrashed her

fierce way along the willows as before.  The captain put down the glass:



"Lord how she walks up on us!  I do hate to be beat!"



"Jim," said George, looking straight ahead, watching the slightest yawing

of the boat and promptly meeting it with the wheel, "how'll it do to try

Murderer's Chute?"



"Well, it's--it's taking chances.  How was the cottonwood stump on the

false point below Boardman's Island this morning?"



"Water just touching the roots."



"Well it's pretty close work.  That gives six feet scant in the head of

Murderer's Chute.  We can just barely rub through if we hit it exactly

right.  But it's worth trying.  She don't dare tackle it!"--meaning the

Amaranth.



In another instant the Boreas plunged into what seemed a crooked creek,

and the Amaranth's approaching lights were shut out in a moment.  Not a

whisper was uttered, now, but the three men stared ahead into the shadows

and two of them spun the wheel back and forth with anxious watchfulness

while the steamer tore along.  The chute seemed to come to an end every

fifty yards, but always opened out in time.  Now the head of it was at

hand.  George tapped the big bell three times, two leadsmen sprang to

their posts, and in a moment their weird cries rose on the night air and

were caught up and repeated by two men on the upper deck:



"No-o bottom!"



"De-e-p four!"



"Half three!"



"Quarter three!"



"Mark under wa-a-ter three!"



"Half twain!"



"Quarter twain!-----"



Davis pulled a couple of ropes--there was a jingling of small bells far

below, the boat's speed slackened, and the pent steam began to whistle

and the gauge-cocks to scream:



"By the mark twain!"



"Quar--ter--her--er--less twain!"



"Eight and a half!"



"Eight feet!"



"Seven-ana-half!"



Another jingling of little bells and the wheels ceased turning

altogether.  The whistling of the steam was something frightful now--it

almost drowned all other noises.



"Stand by to meet her!"



George had the wheel hard down and was standing on a spoke.



"All ready!"



The, boat hesitated seemed to hold her breath, as did the captain and

pilots--and then she began to fall away to starboard and every eye

lighted:



"Now then!--meet her!  meet her!  Snatch her!"



The wheel flew to port so fast that the spokes blended into a spider-web

--the swing of the boat subsided--she steadied herself----



"Seven feet!"



"Sev--six and a half!"



"Six feet!  Six f----"



Bang!  She hit the bottom!  George shouted through the tube:



"Spread her wide open!  Whale it at her!"



Pow-wow-chow!  The escape-pipes belched snowy pillars of steam aloft, the

boat ground and surged and trembled--and slid over into----



"M-a-r-k twain!"



"Quarter-her----"



"Tap!  tap!  tap!" (to signify "Lay in the leads")



And away she went, flying up the willow shore, with the whole silver sea

of the Mississippi stretching abroad on every hand.



No Amaranth in sight!



"Ha-ha, boys, we took a couple of tricks that time!" said the captain.



And just at that moment a red glare appeared in the head of the chute and

the Amaranth came springing after them!



"Well, I swear!"



"Jim, what is the meaning of that?"



"I'll tell you what's the meaning of it.  That hail we had at Napoleon

was Wash Hastings, wanting to come to Cairo--and we didn't stop.  He's in

that pilot house, now, showing those mud turtles how to hunt for easy

water."



"That's it!  I thought it wasn't any slouch that was running that middle

bar in Hog-eye Bend.  If it's Wash Hastings--well, what he don't know

about the river ain't worth knowing--a regular gold-leaf, kid-glove,

diamond breastpin pilot Wash Hastings is.  We won't take any tricks off

of him, old man!"



"I wish I'd a stopped for him, that's all."



The Amaranth was within three hundred yards of the Boreas, and still

gaining.  The "old man" spoke through the tube:



"What is she-carrying now?"



"A hundred and sixty-five, sir!"



"How's your wood?"



"Pine all out-cypress half gone-eating up cotton-wood like pie!"



"Break into that rosin on the main deck-pile it in, the boat can pay for

it!"



Soon the boat was plunging and quivering and screaming more madly than

ever.  But the Amaranth's head was almost abreast the Boreas's stern:



"How's your steam, now, Harry?"



"Hundred and eighty-two, sir!"



"Break up the casks of bacon in the forrard hold!  Pile it in!  Levy on

that turpentine in the fantail-drench every stick of wood with it!"



The boat was a moving earthquake by this time:



"How is she now?"



"A hundred and ninety-six and still a-swelling!--water, below the middle

gauge-cocks!--carrying every pound she can stand!--nigger roosting on the

safety-valve!"



"Good!  How's your draft?"



"Bully!  Every time a nigger heaves a stick of wood into the furnace he

goes out the chimney, with it!"



The Amaranth drew steadily up till her jack-staff breasted the Boreas's

wheel-house--climbed along inch by inch till her chimneys breasted it--

crept along, further and further, till the boats were wheel to wheel--and

then they, closed up with a heavy jolt and locked together tight and fast

in the middle of the big river under the flooding moonlight!  A roar and

a hurrah went up from the crowded decks of both steamers--all hands

rushed to the guards to look and shout and gesticulate--the weight

careened the vessels over toward each other--officers flew hither and

thither cursing and storming, trying to drive the people amidships--both

captains were leaning over their railings shaking their fists, swearing

and threatening--black volumes of smoke rolled up and canopied the

scene,--delivering a rain of sparks upon the vessels--two pistol shots

rang out, and both captains dodged unhurt and the packed masses of

passengers surged back and fell apart while the shrieks of women and

children soared above the intolerable din----



And then there was a booming roar, a thundering crash, and the riddled

Amaranth dropped loose from her hold and drifted helplessly away!



Instantly the fire-doors of the Boreas were thrown open and the men began

dashing buckets of water into the furnaces--for it would have been death

and destruction to stop the engines with such a head of steam on.



As soon as possible the Boreas dropped down to the floating wreck and

took off the dead, the wounded and the unhurt--at least all that could be

got at, for the whole forward half of the boat was a shapeless ruin, with

the great chimneys lying crossed on top of it, and underneath were a

dozen victims imprisoned alive and wailing for help.  While men with axes

worked with might and main to free these poor fellows, the Boreas's boats

went about, picking up stragglers from the river.



And now a new horror presented itself.  The wreck took fire from the

dismantled furnaces!  Never did men work with a heartier will than did

those stalwart braves with the axes.  But it was of no use.  The fire ate

its way steadily, despising the bucket brigade that fought it.  It

scorched the clothes, it singed the hair of the axemen--it drove them

back, foot by foot-inch by inch--they wavered, struck a final blow in the

teeth of the enemy, and surrendered.  And as they fell back they heard

prisoned voices saying:



"Don't leave us!  Don't desert us!  Don't, don't do it!"



And one poor fellow said:



"I am Henry Worley, striker of the Amaranth!  My mother lives in St.

Louis.  Tell her a lie for a poor devil's sake, please.  Say I was killed

in an instant and never knew what hurt me--though God knows I've neither

scratch nor bruise this moment!  It's hard to burn up in a coop like this

with the whole wide world so near.  Good-bye boys--we've all got to come

to it at last, anyway!"



The Boreas stood away out of danger, and the ruined steamer went drifting

down the stream an island of wreathing and climbing flame that vomited

clouds of smoke from time to time, and glared more fiercely and sent its

luminous tongues higher and higher after each emission.  A shriek at

intervals told of a captive that had met his doom.  The wreck lodged upon

a sandbar, and when the Boreas turned the next point on her upward

journey it was still burning with scarcely abated fury.



When the boys came down into the main saloon of the Boreas, they saw a

pitiful sight and heard a world of pitiful sounds.  Eleven poor creatures

lay dead and forty more lay moaning, or pleading or screaming, while a

score of Good Samaritans moved among them doing what they could to

relieve their sufferings; bathing their chinless faces and bodies with

linseed oil and lime water and covering the places with bulging masses of

raw cotton that gave to every face and form a dreadful and unhuman

aspect.



A little wee French midshipman of fourteen lay fearfully injured, but

never uttered a sound till a physician of Memphis was about to dress his

hurts.  Then he said:



"Can I get well?  You need not be afraid to tell me."



"No--I--I am afraid you can not."



"Then do not waste your time with me--help those that can get well."



"But----"



"Help those that can get well!  It is, not for me to be a girl.  I carry

the blood of eleven generations of soldiers in my veins!"



The physician--himself a man who had seen service in the navy in his

time--touched his hat to this little hero, and passed on.



The head engineer of the Amaranth, a grand specimen of physical manhood,

struggled to his feet a ghastly spectacle and strode toward his brother,

the second engineer, who was unhurt.  He said:



"You were on watch.  You were boss.  You would not listen to me when I

begged you to reduce your steam.  Take that!--take it to my wife and tell

her it comes from me by the hand of my murderer!  Take it--and take my

curse with it to blister your heart a hundred years--and may you live so

long!"



And he tore a ring from his finger, stripping flesh and skin with it,

threw it down and fell dead!



But these things must not be dwelt upon.  The Boreas landed her dreadful

cargo at the next large town and delivered it over to a multitude of

eager hands and warm southern hearts--a cargo amounting by this time to

39 wounded persons and 22 dead bodies.  And with these she delivered a

list of 96 missing persons that had drowned or otherwise perished at the

scene of the disaster.



A jury of inquest was impaneled, and after due deliberation and inquiry

they returned the inevitable American verdict which has been so familiar

to our ears all the days of our lives--"NOBODY TO BLAME."



**[The incidents of the explosion are not invented.  They happened just

as they are told.--The Authors.]









CHAPTER V.



Il veut faire secher de la neige au four et la vendre pour du sel blanc.





When the Boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up the

river, the Hawkinses were richer by twenty-four hours of experience in

the contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest hard

work how to relieve it.  And they were richer in another way also.

In the early turmoil an hour after the explosion, a little black-eyed

girl of five years, frightened and crying bitterly, was struggling

through the throng in the Boreas' saloon calling her mother and father,

but no one answered.  Something in the face of Mr. Hawkins attracted her

and she came and looked up at him; was satisfied, and took refuge with

him.  He petted her, listened to her troubles, and said he would find her

friends for her.  Then he put her in a state-room with his children and

told them to be kind to her (the adults of his party were all busy with

the wounded) and straightway began his search.



It was fruitless.  But all day he and his wife made inquiries, and hoped

against hope.  All that they could learn was that the child and her

parents came on board at New Orleans, where they had just arrived in a

vessel from Cuba; that they looked like people from the Atlantic States;

that the family name was Van Brunt and the child's name Laura.  This was

all.  The parents had not been seen since the explosion.  The child's

manners were those of a little lady, and her clothes were daintier and

finer than any Mrs. Hawkins had ever seen before.



As the hours dragged on the child lost heart, and cried so piteously for

her mother that it seemed to the Hawkinses that the moanings and the

wailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so strain

at their heart-strings as the sufferings of this little desolate

creature.  They tried hard to comfort her; and in trying, learned to love

her; they could not help it, seeing how she clung, to them and put her

arms about their necks and found-no solace but in their kind eyes and

comforting words: There was a question in both their hearts--a question

that rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as the

hours wore on--but both hesitated to give it voice--both kept silence--

and--waited.  But a time came at last when the matter would bear delay no

longer.  The boat had landed, and the dead and the wounded were being

conveyed to the shore.  The tired child was asleep in the arms of Mrs.

Hawkins.  Mr. Hawkins came into their presence and stood without

speaking.  His eyes met his wife's; then both looked at the child--and as

they looked it stirred in its sleep and nestled closer; an expression of

contentment and peace settled upon its face that touched the mother-

heart; and when the eyes of husband and wife met again, the question was

asked and answered.



When the Boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time the

Hawkinses joined her, a long rank of steamboats was sighted, packed side

by side at a wharf like sardines, in a box, and above and beyond them

rose the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of a

city--a city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it.

This was St. Louis.  The children of the Hawkins family were playing

about the hurricane deck, and the father and mother were sitting in the

lee of the pilot house essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved

that they were not succeeding.



"They're worth all the trouble they are, Nancy."



"Yes, and more, Si."



"I believe you!  You wouldn't sell one of them at a good round figure?"



"Not for all the money in the bank, Si."



"My own sentiments every time.  It is true we are not rich--but still you

are not sorry---you haven't any misgivings about the additions?"



"No.  God will provide"



"Amen.  And so you wouldn't even part with Clay? Or Laura!"



"Not for anything in the world.  I love them just the same as I love my

own: They pet me and spoil me even more than the others do, I think.

I reckon we'll get along, Si."



"Oh yes, it will all come out right, old mother.  I wouldn't be afraid to

adopt a thousand children if I wanted to, for there's that Tennessee

Land, you know--enough to make an army of them rich.  A whole army,

Nancy!  You and I will never see the day, but these little chaps will.

Indeed they will.  One of these days it will be the rich Miss Emily

Hawkins--and the wealthy Miss Laura Van Brunt Hawkins--and the Hon.

George Washington Hawkins, millionaire--and Gov. Henry Clay Hawkins,

millionaire!  That is the way the world will word it!  Don't let's ever

fret about the children, Nancy--never in the world.  They're all right.

Nancy, there's oceans and oceans of money in that land--mark my words!"



The children had stopped playing, for the moment, and drawn near to

listen.  Hawkins said:



"Washington, my boy, what will you do when you get to be one of the

richest men in the world?"



"I don't know, father.  Sometimes I think I'll have a balloon and go up

in the air; and sometimes I think I'll have ever so many books; and

sometimes I think I'll have ever so many weathercocks and water-wheels;

or have a machine like that one you and Colonel Sellers bought; and

sometimes I think I'll have--well, somehow I don't know--somehow I ain't

certain; maybe I'll get a steamboat first."



"The same old chap!--always just a little bit divided about things.--And

what will you do when you get to be one of the richest men in the world,

Clay?"



"I don't know, sir.  My mother--my other mother that's gone away--she

always told me to work along and not be much expecting to get rich, and

then I wouldn't be disappointed if I didn't get rich.  And so I reckon

it's better for me to wait till I get rich, and then by that time maybe

I'll know what I'll want--but I don't now, sir."



"Careful old head!--Governor Henry Clay Hawkins!--that's what you'll be,

Clay, one of these days.  Wise old head! weighty old head!  Go on, now,

and play--all of you.  It's a prime lot, Nancy; as the Obedstown folk say

about their hogs."



A smaller steamboat received the Hawkinses and their fortunes, and bore

them a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the Mississippi, and

landed them at a little tumble-down village on the Missouri shore in the

twilight of a mellow October day.



The next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they

wended slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited

forest solitudes.  And when for the last time they pitched their tents,

metaphorically speaking, it was at the goal of their hopes, their new

home.



By the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin, one story high--the store;

clustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins, some new,

some old.



In the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless enough.

Two or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a dry-goods

box, and whittled it with their knives, kicked it with their vast boots,

and shot tobacco-juice at various marks.  Several ragged negroes leaned

comfortably against the posts of the awning and contemplated the arrival

of the wayfarers with lazy curiosity.  All these people presently managed

to drag themselves to the vicinity of the Hawkins' wagon, and there they

took up permanent positions, hands in pockets and resting on one leg; and

thus anchored they proceeded to look and enjoy.  Vagrant dogs came

wagging around and making inquiries of Hawkins's dog, which were not

satisfactory and they made war on him in concert.  This would have

interested the citizens but it was too many on one to amount to anything

as a fight, and so they commanded the peace and the foreign dog coiled

his tail and took sanctuary under the wagon.  Slatternly negro girls and

women slouched along with pails deftly balanced on their heads, and

joined the group and stared.  Little half dressed white boys, and little

negro boys with nothing whatever on but tow-linen shirts with a fine

southern exposure, came from various directions and stood with their

hands locked together behind them and aided in the inspection.  The rest

of the population were laying down their employments and getting ready to

come, when a man burst through the assemblage and seized the new-comers

by the hands in a frenzy of welcome, and exclaimed--indeed almost

shouted:



"Well who could have believed it!  Now is it you sure enough--turn

around! hold up your heads! I want to look at you good!  Well, well,

well, it does seem most too good to be true, I declare!  Lord, I'm so

glad to see you!  Does a body's whole soul good to look at you!  Shake

hands again!  Keep on shaking hands!  Goodness gracious alive.  What will

my wife say?--Oh yes indeed, it's so!--married only last week--lovely,

perfectly lovely creature, the noblest woman that ever--you'll like her,

Nancy!  Like her?  Lord bless me you'll love her--you'll dote on her--

you'll be twins!  Well, well, well, let me look at you again!  Same old--

why bless my life it was only jest this very morning that my wife says,

'Colonel'--she will call me Colonel spite of everything I can do--she

says 'Colonel, something tells me somebody's coming!'  and sure enough

here you are, the last people on earth a body could have expected.

Why she'll think she's a prophetess--and hanged if I don't think so too--

and you know there ain't any, country but what a prophet's an honor to,

as the proverb says.  Lord bless me and here's the children, too!

Washington, Emily, don't you know me?  Come, give us a kiss.  Won't I fix

you, though!--ponies, cows, dogs, everything you can think of that'll

delight a child's heart-and--Why how's this?  Little strangers?  Well

you won't be any strangers here, I can tell you.  Bless your souls we'll

make you think you never was at home before--'deed and 'deed we will,

I can tell you!  Come, now, bundle right along with me.  You can't

glorify any hearth stone but mine in this camp, you know--can't eat

anybody's bread but mine--can't do anything but just make yourselves

perfectly at home and comfortable, and spread yourselves out and rest!

You hear me!  Here--Jim, Tom, Pete, Jake, fly around!  Take that team to

my place--put the wagon in my lot--put the horses under the shed, and get

out hay and oats and fill them up!  Ain't any hay and oats?  Well get

some--have it charged to me--come, spin around, now!  Now, Hawkins, the

procession's ready; mark time, by the left flank, forward-march!"



And the Colonel took the lead, with Laura astride his neck, and the

newly-inspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs

with quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake.



Presently they were ranged about an old-time fire-place whose blazing

logs sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat, but that was no

matter-supper was needed, and to have it, it had to be cooked.  This

apartment was the family bedroom, parlor, library and kitchen, all in

one.  The matronly little wife of the Colonel moved hither and thither

and in and out with her pots and pans in her hands', happiness in her

heart and a world of admiration of her husband in her eyes.  And when at

last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn bread, fried

chickens, bacon, buttermilk, coffee, and all manner of country luxuries,

Col. Sellers modified his harangue and for a moment throttled it down to

the orthodox pitch for a blessing, and then instantly burst forth again

as from a parenthesis and clattered on with might and main till every

stomach in the party was laden with all it could carry.  And when the

new-comers ascended the ladder to their comfortable feather beds on the

second floor--to wit the garret--Mrs. Hawkins was obliged to say:



"Hang the fellow, I do believe he has gone wilder than ever, but still a

body can't help liking him if they would--and what is more, they don't

ever want to try when they see his eyes and hear him talk."



Within a week or two the Hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a new

log house, and were beginning to feel at home.  The children were put to

school; at least it was what passed for a school in those days: a place

where tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours a day

to learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and reciting

it by rote, like parrots; so that a finished education consisted simply

of a permanent headache and the ability to read without stopping to spell

the words or take breath.  Hawkins bought out the village store for a

song and proceeded to reap the profits, which amounted to but little more

than another song.



The wonderful speculation hinted at by Col. Sellers in his letter turned

out to be the raising of mules for the Southern market; and really it

promised very well.  The young stock cost but a trifle, the rearing but

another trifle, and so Hawkins was easily persuaded to embark his slender

means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and care of the animals to

Sellers and Uncle Dan'l.



All went well: Business prospered little by little.  Hawkins even built a

new house, made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod on it.

People came two or three miles to look at it.  But they knew that the rod

attracted the lightning, and so they gave the place a wide berth in a

storm, for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the

lightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half

oftener than once in a hundred and fifty times.  Hawkins fitted out his

house with "store" furniture from St. Louis, and the fame of its

magnificence went abroad in the land.  Even the parlor carpet was from

St. Louis--though the other rooms were clothed in the "rag" carpeting of

the country.  Hawkins put up the first "paling" fence that had ever

adorned the village; and he did not stop there, but whitewashed it.

His oil-cloth window-curtains had noble pictures on them of castles such

as had never been seen anywhere in the world but on window-curtains.

Hawkins enjoyed the admiration these prodigies compelled, but he always

smiled to think how poor and, cheap they were, compared to what the

Hawkins mansion would display in a future day after the Tennessee Land

should have borne its minted fruit.  Even Washington observed, once, that

when the Tennessee Land was sold he would have a "store" carpet in his

and Clay's room like the one in the parlor.  This pleased Hawkins, but it

troubled his wife.  It did not seem wise, to her, to put one's entire

earthly trust in the Tennessee Land and never think of doing any work.



Hawkins took a weekly Philadelphia newspaper and a semi-weekly St. Louis

journal--almost the only papers that came to the village, though Godey's

Lady's Book found a good market there and was regarded as the perfection

of polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the place.  Perhaps

it is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by gone age--some

twenty or thirty years ago.  In the two newspapers referred to lay the

secret of Hawkins's growing prosperity.  They kept him informed of the

condition of the crops south and east, and thus he knew which articles

were likely to be in demand and which articles were likely to be

unsalable, weeks and even months in advance of the simple folk about him.

As the months went by he came to be regarded as a wonderfully lucky man.

It did not occur to the citizens that brains were at the bottom of his

luck.



His title of "Squire" came into vogue again, but only for a season; for,

as his wealth and popularity augmented, that title, by imperceptible

stages, grew up into "Judge;" indeed' it bade fair to swell into

"General" bye and bye.  All strangers of consequence who visited the

village gravitated to the Hawkins Mansion and became guests of the

"Judge."



Hawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much.  They

were uncouth and not cultivated, and not particularly industrious; but

they were honest and straightforward, and their virtuous ways commanded

respect.  Their patriotism was strong, their pride in the flag was of the

old fashioned pattern, their love of country amounted to idolatry.

Whoever dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless

hatred.  They still cursed Benedict Arnold as if he were a personal

friend who had broken faith--but a week gone by.









CHAPTER VI.



We skip ten years and this history finds certain changes to record.



Judge Hawkins and Col. Sellers have made and lost two or three moderate

fortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty.  Sellers has two

pairs of twins and four extras.  In Hawkins's family are six children of

his own and two adopted ones.  From time to time, as fortune smiled, the

elder children got the benefit of it, spending the lucky seasons at

excellent schools in St. Louis and the unlucky ones at home in the

chafing discomfort of straightened circumstances.



Neither the Hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever supposed

that one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage: Such difference

as existed between Laura and Emily is not uncommon in a family.  The

girls had grown up as sisters, and they were both too young at the time

of the fearful accident on the Mississippi to know that it was that which

had thrown their lives together.



And yet any one who had known the secret of Laura's birth and had seen

her during these passing years, say at the happy age of twelve or

thirteen, would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more

winsome than her school companion.



Philosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in

the careless school-girl, that makes her attractive, the undeveloped

maidenhood, or the mere natural, careless sweetness of childhood.

If Laura at twelve was beginning to be a beauty, the thought of it had

never entered her head.  No, indeed.  Her mind wad filled with more

important thoughts.  To her simple school-girl dress she was beginning to

add those mysterious little adornments of ribbon-knots and ear-rings,

which were the subject of earnest consultations with her grown friends.



When she tripped down the street on a summer's day with her dainty hands

propped into the ribbon-broidered pockets of her apron, and elbows

consequently more or less akimbo with her wide Leghorn hat flapping down

and hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore

head the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty; with all

her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play, and that sweet ignorance

of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about her that

belong to her gracious time of life, indeed she was a vision to warm the

coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest.



Willful, generous, forgiving, imperious, affectionate, improvident,

bewitching, in short--was Laura at this period.  Could she have remained

there, this history would not need to be written.  But Laura had grown to

be almost a woman in these few years, to the end of which we have now

come--years which had seen Judge Hawkins pass through so many trials.



When the judge's first bankruptcy came upon him, a homely human angel

intruded upon him with an offer of $1,500 for the Tennessee Land.  Mrs.

Hawkins said take it.  It was a grievous temptation, but the judge

withstood it.  He said the land was for the children--he could not rob

them of their future millions for so paltry a sum.  When the second

blight fell upon him, another angel appeared and offered $3,000 for the

land.  He was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade

him to let the papers be drawn; but when his children came into his

presence in their poor apparel, he felt like a traitor and refused to

sign.



But now he was down again, and deeper in the mire than ever.  He paced

the floor all day, he scarcely slept at night.  He blushed even to

acknowledge it to himself, but treason was in his mind--he was

meditating, at last, the sale of the land.  Mrs. Hawkins stepped into the

room.  He had not spoken a word, but he felt as guilty as if she had

caught him in some shameful act.  She said:



"Si, I do not know what we are going to do.  The children are not fit to

be seen, their clothes are in such a state.  But there's something more

serious still.--There is scarcely a bite in the house to eat"



"Why, Nancy, go to Johnson----."



"Johnson indeed!  You took that man's part when he hadn't a friend in the

world, and you built him up and made him rich.  And here's the result of

it: He lives in our fine house, and we live in his miserable log cabin.

He has hinted to our children that he would rather they wouldn't come

about his yard to play with his children,--which I can bear, and bear

easy enough, for they're not a sort we want to associate with much--but

what I can't bear with any quietness at all, is his telling Franky our

bill was running pretty high this morning when I sent him for some meal--

and that was all he said, too--didn't give him the meal--turned off and

went to talking with the Hargrave girls about some stuff they wanted to

cheapen."



"Nancy, this is astounding!"



"And so it is, I warrant you.  I've kept still, Si, as long as ever I

could.  Things have been getting worse and worse, and worse and worse,

every single day; I don't go out of the house, I feel so down; but you

had trouble enough, and I wouldn't say a word--and I wouldn't say a word

now, only things have got so bad that I don't know what to do, nor where

to turn."  And she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried.



"Poor child, don't grieve so.  I never thought that of Johnson.  I am

clear at my wit's end.  I don't know what in the world to do.  Now if

somebody would come along and offer $3,000--Uh, if somebody only would

come along and offer $3,000 for that Tennessee Land."



"You'd sell it, S!" said Mrs. Hawkins excitedly.



"Try me!"



Mrs. Hawkins was out of the room in a moment.  Within a minute she was

back again with a business-looking stranger, whom she seated, and then

she took her leave again.  Hawkins said to himself, "How can a man ever

lose faith?  When the blackest hour comes, Providence always comes with

it--ah, this is the very timeliest help that ever poor harried devil had;

if this blessed man offers but a thousand I'll embrace him like a

brother!"



The stranger said:



"I am aware that you own 75,000 acres, of land in East Tennessee, and

without sacrificing your time, I will come to the point at once.  I am

agent of an iron manufacturing company, and they empower me to offer you

ten thousand dollars for that land."



Hawkins's heart bounded within him.  His whole frame was racked and

wrenched with fettered hurrahs.  His first impulse was to shout "Done!

and God bless the iron company, too!"



But a something flitted through his mind, and his opened lips uttered

nothing.  The enthusiasm faded away from his eyes, and the look of a man

who is thinking took its place.  Presently, in a hesitating, undecided

way, he said:



"Well, I--it don't seem quite enough.  That--that is a very valuable

property--very valuable.  It's brim full of iron-ore, sir--brim full of

it!  And copper, coal,--everything--everything you can think of!  Now,

I'll tell you what I'll, do.  I'll reserve everything except the iron,

and I'll sell them the iron property for $15,000 cash, I to go in with

them and own an undivided interest of one-half the concern--or the stock,

as you may say.  I'm out of business, and I'd just as soon help run the

thing as not.  Now how does that strike you?"



"Well, I am only an agent of these people, who are friends of mine, and

I am not even paid for my services.  To tell you the truth, I have tried

to persuade them not to go into the thing; and I have come square out

with their offer, without throwing out any feelers--and I did it in the

hope that you would refuse.  A man pretty much always refuses another

man's first offer, no matter what it is.  But I have performed my duty,

and will take pleasure in telling them what you say."



He was about to rise.  Hawkins said,



"Wait a bit."



Hawkins thought again.  And the substance of his thought was: "This

is a deep man; this is a very deep man; I don't like his candor; your

ostentatiously candid business man's a deep fox--always a deep fox;

this man's that iron company himself--that's what he is; he wants that

property, too; I am not so blind but I can see that; he don't want the

company to go into this thing--O, that's very good; yes, that's very

good indeed--stuff! he'll be back here tomorrow, sure, and take my offer;

take it?  I'll risk anything he is suffering to take it now; here--I must

mind what I'm about.  What has started this sudden excitement about iron?

I wonder what is in the wind? just as sure as I'm alive this moment,

there's something tremendous stirring in iron speculation" [here Hawkins

got up and began to pace the floor with excited eyes and with gesturing

hands]--"something enormous going on in iron, without the shadow of a

doubt, and here I sit mousing in the dark and never knowing anything

about it; great heaven, what an escape I've made! this underhanded

mercenary creature might have taken me up--and ruined me! but I have

escaped, and I warrant me I'll not put my foot into--"



He stopped and turned toward the stranger; saying:



"I have made you a proposition, you have not accepted it, and I desire

that you will consider that I have made none.  At the same time my

conscience will not allow me to--.  Please alter the figures I named to

thirty thousand dollars, if you will, and let the proposition go to the

company--I will stick to it if it breaks my heart!"  The stranger looked

amused, and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in his

expression, too, but Hawkins never noticed it.  Indeed he scarcely

noticed anything or knew what he was about.  The man left; Hawkins flung

himself into a chair; thought a few moments, then glanced around, looked

frightened, sprang to the door----



"Too late--too late!  He's gone!  Fool that I am! always a fool!  Thirty

thousand--ass that I am!  Oh, why didn't I say fifty thousand!"



He plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his knees,

and fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish.  Mrs. Hawkins

sprang in, beaming:



"Well, Si?"



"Oh, con-found the con-founded--con-found it, Nancy.  I've gone and done

it, now!"



"Done what Si for mercy's sake!"



"Done everything!  Ruined everything!"



"Tell me, tell me, tell me!  Don't keep a body in such suspense.  Didn't

he buy, after all?  Didn't he make an offer?"



Offer?  He offered $10,000 for our land, and----"



"Thank the good providence from the very bottom of my heart of hearts!

What sort of ruin do you call that, Si!"



"Nancy, do you suppose I listened to such a preposterous proposition?

No!  Thank fortune I'm not a simpleton!  I saw through the pretty scheme

in a second.  It's a vast iron speculation!--millions upon millions in

it!  But fool as I am I told him he could have half the iron property for

thirty thousand--and if I only had him back here he couldn't touch it for

a cent less than a quarter of a million!"



Mrs. Hawkins looked up white and despairing:



"You threw away this chance, you let this man go, and we in this awful

trouble?  You don't mean it, you can't mean it!"



"Throw it away?  Catch me at it!  Why woman, do you suppose that man

don't know what he is about?  Bless you, he'll be back fast enough to-

morrow."



"Never, never, never.  He never will comeback.  I don't know what is to

become of us.  I don't know what in the world is to become of us."



A shade of uneasiness came into Hawkins's face.  He said:



"Why, Nancy, you--you can't believe what you are saying."



"Believe it, indeed?  I know it, Si.  And I know that we haven't a cent

in the world, and we've sent ten thousand dollars a-begging."



"Nancy, you frighten me.  Now could that man--is it possible that I--

hanged if I don't believe I have missed a chance!  Don't grieve, Nancy,

don't grieve.  I'll go right after him.  I'll take--I'll take--what a

fool I am!--I'll take anything he'll give!"



The next instant he left the house on a run.  But the man was no longer

in the town.  Nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had gone.

Hawkins came slowly back, watching wistfully but hopelessly for the

stranger, and lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart.  And

when his foot finally pressed his own threshold, the value he held the

entire Tennessee property at was five hundred dollars--two hundred down

and the rest in three equal annual payments, without interest.



There was a sad gathering at the Hawkins fireside the next night.  All

the children were present but Clay.  Mr. Hawkins said:



"Washington, we seem to be hopelessly fallen, hopelessly involved.  I am

ready to give up.  I do not know where to turn--I never have been down so

low before, I never have seen things so dismal.  There are many mouths to

feed; Clay is at work; we must lose you, also, for a little while, my

boy.  But it will not be long--the Tennessee land----"



He stopped, and was conscious of a blush.  There was silence for a

moment, and then Washington--now a lank, dreamy-eyed stripling between

twenty-two and twenty-three years of age--said:



"If Col. Sellers would come for me, I would go and stay with him a while,

till the Tennessee land is sold.  He has often wanted me to come, ever

since he moved to Hawkeye."



"I'm afraid he can't well come for you, Washington.  From what I can

hear--not from him of course, but from others--he is not far from as bad

off as we are--and his family is as large, too.  He might find something

for you to do, maybe, but you'd better try to get to him yourself,

Washington--it's only thirty miles."



"But how can I, father?  There's no stage or anything."



"And if there were, stages require money.  A stage goes from Swansea,

five miles from here.  But it would be cheaper to walk."



"Father, they must know you there, and no doubt they would credit you in

a moment, for a little stage ride like that.  Couldn't you write and ask

them?"



"Couldn't you, Washington--seeing it's you that wants the ride?  And what

do you think you'll do, Washington, when you get to Hawkeye?  Finish your

invention for making window-glass opaque?"



"No, sir, I have given that up.  I almost knew I could do it, but it was

so tedious and troublesome I quit it."



"I was afraid of it, my boy.  Then I suppose you'll finish your plan of

coloring hen's eggs by feeding a peculiar diet to the hen?"



"No, sir.  I believe I have found out the stuff that will do it, but it

kills the hen; so I have dropped that for the present, though I can take

it up again some day when I learn how to manage the mixture better."



"Well, what have you got on hand--anything?"



"Yes, sir, three or four things.  I think they are all good and can all

be done, but they are tiresome, and besides they require money.  But as

soon as the land is sold----"



"Emily, were you about to say something?" said Hawkins.



Yes, sir.  If you are willing, I will go to St. Louis.  That will make

another mouth less to feed.  Mrs. Buckner has always wanted me to come."



"But the money, child?"



"Why I think she would send it, if you would write her--and I know she

would wait for her pay till----"



"Come, Laura, let's hear from you, my girl."



Emily and Laura were about the same age--between seventeen and eighteen.

Emily was fair and pretty, girlish and diffident--blue eyes and light

hair.  Laura had a proud bearing, and a somewhat mature look; she had

fine, clean-cut features, her complexion was pure white and contrasted

vividly with her black hair and eyes; she was not what one calls pretty--

she was beautiful.  She said:



"I will go to St. Louis, too, sir.  I will find a way to get there.

I will make a way.  And I will find a way to help myself along, and do

what I can to help the rest, too."



She spoke it like a princess.  Mrs. Hawkins smiled proudly and kissed

her, saying in a tone of fond reproof:



"So one of my girls is going to turn out and work for her living!  It's

like your pluck and spirit, child, but we will hope that we haven't got

quite down to that, yet."



The girl's eyes beamed affection under her mother's caress.  Then she

straightened up, folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid

ice-berg.  Clay's dog put up his brown nose for a little attention, and

got it.  He retired under the table with an apologetic yelp, which did

not affect the iceberg.



Judge Hawkins had written and asked Clay to return home and consult with

him upon family affairs.  He arrived the evening after this conversation,

and the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome.  He brought sadly

needed help with him, consisting of the savings of a year and a half of

work--nearly two hundred dollars in money.



It was a ray of sunshine which (to this easy household) was the earnest

of a clearing sky.



Bright and early in the morning the family were astir, and all were busy

preparing Washington for his journey--at least all but Washington

himself, who sat apart, steeped in a reverie.  When the time for his

departure came, it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard

it was to let him go, notwithstanding they had often seen him go before,

in his St. Louis schooling days.  In the most matter-of-course way they

had borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip, never seeming to

think of his helping in the matter; in the same matter-of-course way Clay

had hired a horse and cart; and now that the good-byes were ended he

bundled Washington's baggage in and drove away with the exile.



At Swansea Clay paid his stage fare, stowed him away in the vehicle, and

saw him off.  Then he returned home and reported progress, like a

committee of the whole.



Clay remained at home several days.  He held many consultations with his

mother upon the financial condition of the family, and talked once with

his father upon the same subject, but only once.  He found a change in

that quarter which was distressing; years of fluctuating fortune had done

their work; each reverse had weakened the father's spirit and impaired

his energies; his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and ambition

dead within him; he had no projects, formed no plans--evidently he was a

vanquished man.  He looked worn and tired.  He inquired into Clay's

affairs and prospects, and when he found that Clay was doing pretty well

and was likely to do still better, it was plain that he resigned himself

with easy facility to look to the son for a support; and he said, "Keep

yourself informed of poor Washington's condition and movements, and help

him along all you can, Clay."



The younger children, also, seemed relieved of all fears and distresses,

and very ready and willing to look to Clay for a livelihood.  Within

three days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the

household.  Clay's hundred and eighty or ninety, dollars had worked a

wonder.  The family were as contented, now, and as free from care as they

could have been with a fortune.  It was well that Mrs. Hawkins held the

purse otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little while.



It took but a trifle to pay Hawkins's outstanding obligations, for he had

always had a horror of debt.



When Clay bade his home good-bye and set out to return to the field of

his labors, he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his father's

family on his hands as pensioners; but he did not allow himself to chafe

at the thought, for he reasoned that his father had dealt by him with a

free hand and a loving one all his life, and now that hard fortune had

broken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure, not a pain, to work for him.

The younger children were born and educated dependents.  They had never

been taught to do anything for themselves, and it did not seem to occur

to them to make an attempt now.



The girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under any

circumstances whatever.  It was a southern family, and of good blood;

and for any person except Laura, either within or without the household

to have suggested such an idea would have brought upon the suggester the

suspicion of being a lunatic.









CHAPTER VII.



          Via, Pecunia! when she's run and gone

          And fled, and dead, then will I fetch her again

          With aqua vita, out of an old hogshead!

          While there are lees of wine, or dregs of beer,

          I'll never want her!  Coin her out of cobwebs,

          Dust, but I'll have her! raise wool upon egg-shells,

          Sir, and make grass grow out of marrow-bones,

          To make her come!

                                        B. Jonson.



Bearing Washington Hawkins and his fortunes, the stage-coach tore out of

Swansea at a fearful gait, with horn tooting gaily and half the town

admiring from doors and windows.  But it did not tear any more after it

got to the outskirts; it dragged along stupidly enough, then--till it

came in sight of the next hamlet; and then the bugle tooted gaily again

and again the vehicle went tearing by the horses.  This sort of conduct

marked every entry to a station and every exit from it; and so in those

days children grew up with the idea that stage-coaches always tore and

always tooted; but they also grew up with the idea that pirates went into

action in their Sunday clothes, carrying the black flag in one hand and

pistolling people with the other, merely because they were so represented

in the pictures--but these illusions vanished when later years brought

their disenchanting wisdom.  They learned then that the stagecoach is but

a poor, plodding, vulgar thing in the solitudes of the highway; and that

the pirate is only a seedy, unfantastic "rough," when he is out of the

pictures.



Toward evening, the stage-coach came thundering into Hawkeye with a

perfectly triumphant ostentation--which was natural and proper, for

Hawkey a was a pretty large town for interior Missouri.  Washington,

very stiff and tired and hungry, climbed out, and wondered how he was to

proceed now.  But his difficulty was quickly solved.  Col. Sellers came

down the street on a run and arrived panting for breath.  He said:



"Lord bless you--I'm glad to see you, Washington--perfectly delighted to

see you, my boy!  I got your message.  Been on the look-out for you.

Heard the stage horn, but had a party I couldn't shake off--man that's

got an enormous thing on hand--wants me to put some capital into it--and

I tell you, my boy, I could do worse, I could do a deal worse.  No, now,

let that luggage alone; I'll fix that.  Here, Jerry, got anything to do?

All right-shoulder this plunder and follow me.  Come along, Washington.

Lord I'm glad to see you!  Wife and the children are just perishing to

look at you.  Bless you, they won't know you, you've grown so.  Folks all

well, I suppose?  That's good--glad to hear that.  We're always going to

run down and see them, but I'm into so many operations, and they're not

things a man feels like trusting to other people, and so somehow we keep

putting it off.  Fortunes in them!  Good gracious, it's the country to

pile up wealth in!  Here we are--here's where the Sellers dynasty hangs

out.  Hump it on the door-step, Jerry--the blackest niggro in the State,

Washington, but got a good heart--mighty likely boy, is Jerry.  And now I

suppose you've got to have ten cents, Jerry.  That's all right--when a

man works for me--when a man--in the other pocket, I reckon--when a man--

why, where the mischief as that portmonnaie!--when a--well now that's

odd--Oh, now I remember, must have left it at the bank; and b'George I've

left my check-book, too--Polly says I ought to have a nurse--well, no

matter.  Let me have a dime, Washington, if you've got--ah, thanks.  Now

clear out, Jerry, your complexion has brought on the twilight half an

hour ahead of time.  Pretty fair joke--pretty fair.  Here he is, Polly!

Washington's come, children! come now, don't eat him up--finish him in

the house.  Welcome, my boy, to a mansion that is proud to shelter the

son of the best man that walks on the ground.  Si Hawkins has been a good

friend to me, and I believe I can say that whenever I've had a chance to

put him into a good thing I've done it, and done it pretty cheerfully,

too.  I put him into that sugar speculation--what a grand thing that was,

if we hadn't held on too long!"



True enough; but holding on too long had utterly ruined both of them;

and the saddest part of it was, that they never had had so much money to

lose before, for Sellers's sale of their mule crop that year in New

Orleans had been a great financial success.  If he had kept out of sugar

and gone back home content to stick to mules it would have been a happy

wisdom.  As it was, he managed to kill two birds with one stone--that is

to say, he killed the sugar speculation by holding for high rates till he

had to sell at the bottom figure, and that calamity killed the mule that

laid the golden egg--which is but a figurative expression and will be so

understood.  Sellers had returned home cheerful but empty-handed, and the

mule business lapsed into other hands.  The sale of the Hawkins property

by the Sheriff had followed, and the Hawkins hearts been torn to see

Uncle Dan'l and his wife pass from the auction-block into the hands of a

negro trader and depart for the remote South to be seen no more by the

family.  It had seemed like seeing their own flesh and blood sold into

banishment.



Washington was greatly pleased with the Sellers mansion.  It was a two-

story-and-a-half brick, and much more stylish than any of its neighbors.

He was borne to the family sitting room in triumph by the swarm of little

Sellerses, the parents following with their arms about each other's

waists.



The whole family were poorly and cheaply dressed; and the clothing,

although neat and clean, showed many evidences of having seen long

service.  The Colonel's "stovepipe" hat was napless and shiny with much

polishing, but nevertheless it had an almost convincing expression about

it of having been just purchased new.  The rest of his clothing was

napless and shiny, too, but it had the air of being entirely satisfied

with itself and blandly sorry for other people's clothes.  It was growing

rather dark in the house, and the evening air was chilly, too.  Sellers

said:



"Lay off your overcoat, Washington, and draw up to the stove and make

yourself at home--just consider yourself under your own shingles my boy--

I'll have a fire going, in a jiffy.  Light the lamp, Polly, dear, and

let's have things cheerful just as glad to see you, Washington, as if

you'd been lost a century and we'd found you again!"



By this time the Colonel was conveying a lighted match into a poor little

stove.  Then he propped the stove door to its place by leaning the poker

against it, for the hinges had retired from business.  This door framed

a small square of isinglass, which now warmed up with a faint glow.

Mrs. Sellers lit a cheap, showy lamp, which dissipated a good deal of the

gloom, and then everybody gathered into the light and took the stove into

close companionship.



The children climbed all over Sellers, fondled him, petted him, and were

lavishly petted in return.  Out from this tugging, laughing, chattering

disguise of legs and arms and little faces, the Colonel's voice worked

its way and his tireless tongue ran blithely on without interruption;

and the purring little wife, diligent with her knitting, sat near at hand

and looked happy and proud and grateful; and she listened as one who

listens to oracles and, gospels and whose grateful soul is being

refreshed with the bread of life.  Bye and bye the children quieted down

to listen; clustered about their father, and resting their elbows on his

legs, they hung upon his words as if he were uttering the music of the

spheres.



A dreary old hair-cloth sofa against the wall; a few damaged chairs; the

small table the lamp stood on; the crippled stove--these things

constituted the furniture of the room.  There was no carpet on the floor;

on the wall were occasional square-shaped interruptions of the general

tint of the plaster which betrayed that there used to be pictures in the

house--but there were none now.  There were no mantel ornaments, unless

one might bring himself to regard as an ornament a clock which never came

within fifteen strokes of striking the right time, and whose hands always

hitched together at twenty-two minutes past anything and traveled in

company the rest of the way home.



"Remarkable clock!" said Sellers, and got up and wound it.  "I've been

offered--well, I wouldn't expect you to believe what I've been offered

for that clock.  Old Gov. Hager never sees me but he says, 'Come, now,

Colonel, name your price--I must have that clock!'  But my goodness I'd

as soon think of selling my wife.  As I was saying to ---- silence in the

court, now, she's begun to strike!  You can't talk against her--you have

to just be patient and hold up till she's said her say.  Ah well, as I

was saying, when--she's beginning again!  Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,

twenty-two, twen----ah, that's all.--Yes, as I was saying to old Judge--

--go it, old girl, don't mind me.--Now how is that?----isn't that a

good, spirited tone?  She can wake the dead!  Sleep?  Why you might as

well try to sleep in a thunder-factory.  Now just listen at that.  She'll

strike a hundred and fifty, now, without stopping,--you'll see.  There

ain't another clock like that in Christendom."



Washington hoped that this might be true, for the din was distracting--

though the family, one and all, seemed filled with joy; and the more the

clock "buckled down to her work" as the Colonel expressed it, and the

more insupportable the clatter became, the more enchanted they all

appeared to be.  When there was silence, Mrs Sellers lifted upon

Washington a face that beamed with a childlike pride, and said:



"It belonged to his grandmother."



The look and the tone were a plain call for admiring surprise, and

therefore Washington said (it was the only thing that offered itself at

the moment:)



"Indeed!"



"Yes, it did, didn't it father!" exclaimed one of the twins.  "She was my

great-grandmother--and George's too; wasn't she, father!  You never saw

her, but Sis has seen her, when Sis was a baby-didn't you, Sis!  Sis has

seen her most a hundred times.  She was awful deef--she's dead, now.

Aint she, father!"



All the children chimed in, now, with one general Babel of information

about deceased--nobody offering to read the riot act or seeming to

discountenance the insurrection or disapprove of it in any way--but the

head twin drowned all the turmoil and held his own against the field:



"It's our clock, now--and it's ,got wheels inside of it, and a thing that

flatters every time she strikes--don't it, father!  Great-grandmother

died before hardly any of us was born--she was an Old-School Baptist and

had warts all over her--you ask father if she didn't.  She had an uncle

once that was bald-headed and used to have fits; he wasn't our uncle,

I don't know what he was to us--some kin or another I reckon--father's

seen him a thousand times--hain't you, father!  We used to have a calf

that et apples and just chawed up dishrags like nothing, and if you stay

here you'll see lots of funerals--won't he, Sis!  Did you ever see a

house afire?  I have!  Once me and Jim Terry----"



But Sellers began to speak now, and the storm ceased.  He began to tell

about an enormous speculation he was thinking of embarking some capital

in--a speculation which some London bankers had been over to consult with

him about--and soon he was building glittering pyramids of coin, and

Washington was presently growing opulent under the magic of his

eloquence.  But at the same time Washington was not able to ignore the

cold entirely.  He was nearly as close to the stove as he could get,

and yet he could not persuade himself, that he felt the slightest heat,

notwithstanding the isinglass' door was still gently and serenely

glowing.  He tried to get a trifle closer to the stove, and the

consequence was, he tripped the supporting poker and the stove-door

tumbled to the floor.  And then there was a revelation--there was nothing

in the stove but a lighted tallow-candle!  The poor youth blushed and

felt as if lie must die with shame.  But the Colonel was only

disconcerted for a moment--he straightway found his voice again:



"A little idea of my own, Washington--one of the greatest things in the

world!  You must write and tell your father about it--don't forget that,

now.  I have been reading up some European Scientific reports--friend of

mine, Count Fugier, sent them to me--sends me all sorts of things from

Paris--he thinks the world of me, Fugier does.  Well, I saw that the

Academy of France had been testing the properties of heat, and they came

to the conclusion that it was a nonconductor or something like that,

and of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous

organizations with excitable temperaments, especially where there is any

tendency toward rheumatic affections.  Bless you I saw in a moment what

was the matter with us, and says I, out goes your fires!--no more slow

torture and certain death for me, sir.  What you want is the appearance

of heat, not the heat itself--that's the idea.  Well how to do it was the

next thing.  I just put my head, to work, pegged away, a couple of days,

and here you are!  Rheumatism?  Why a man can't any more start a case of

rheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy!

Stove with a candle in it and a transparent door--that's it--it has been

the salvation of this family.  Don't you fail to write your father about

it, Washington.  And tell him the idea is mine--I'm no more conceited

than most people, I reckon, but you know it is human nature for a man to

want credit for a thing like that."



Washington said with his blue lips that he would, but he said in his

secret heart that he would promote no such iniquity.  He tried to believe

in the healthfulness of the invention, and succeeded tolerably well;

but after all he could not feel that good health in a frozen, body was

any real improvement on the rheumatism.

          And there within, sir, are the golden mines,

          Great Solomon's Ophir!----

                                   B. Jonson



The supper at Col. Sellers's was not sumptuous, in the beginning, but it

improved on acquaintance.  That is to say, that what Washington regarded

at first sight as mere lowly potatoes, presently became awe-inspiring

agricultural productions that had been reared in some ducal garden beyond

the sea, under the sacred eye of the duke himself, who had sent them to

Sellers; the bread was from corn which could be grown in only one favored

locality in the earth and only a favored few could get it; the Rio

coffee, which at first seemed execrable to the taste, took to itself an

improved flavor when Washington was told to drink it slowly and not hurry

what should be a lingering luxury in order to be fully appreciated--it

was from the private stores of a Brazilian nobleman with an

unrememberable name.  The Colonel's tongue was a magician's wand that

turned dried apples into figs and water into wine as easily as it could

change a hovel into a palace and present poverty into imminent future

riches.



Washington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a

palace in the morning; at least the palace lingered during the moment

that he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings--and then it

disappeared and he recognized that the Colonel's inspiring talk had been

influencing his dreams.  Fatigue had made him sleep late; when he entered

the sitting room he noticed that the old hair-cloth sofa was absent; when

he sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars in bills

on the table, counted them over, said he was a little short and must call

upon his banker; then returned the bills to his wallet with the

indifferent air of a man who is used to money.  The breakfast was not an

improvement upon the supper, but the Colonel talked it up and transformed

it into an oriental feast.  Bye and bye, he said:



"I intend to look out for you, Washington, my boy.  I hunted up a place

for you yesterday, but I am not referring to that,--now--that is a mere

livelihood--mere bread and butter; but when I say I mean to look out for

you I mean something very different.  I mean to put things in your way

than will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing.  I'll put you in a way

to make more money than you'll ever know what to do with.  You'll be

right here where I can put my hand on you when anything turns up.  I've

got some prodigious operations on foot; but I'm keeping quiet; mum's the

word; your old hand don't go around pow-wowing and letting everybody see

his k'yards and find out his little game.  But all in good time,

Washington, all in good time.  You'll see.  Now there's an operation in

corn that looks well.  Some New York men are trying to get me to go into

it--buy up all the growing crops and just boss the market when they

mature--ah I tell you it's a great thing.  And it only costs a trifle;

two millions or two and a half will do it.  I haven't exactly promised

yet--there's no hurry--the more indifferent I seem, you know, the more

anxious those fellows will get.  And then there is the hog speculation--

that's bigger still.  We've got quiet men at work," [he was very

impressive here,] "mousing around, to get propositions out of all the

farmers in the whole west and northwest for the hog crop, and other

agents quietly getting propositions and terms out of all the

manufactories--and don't you see, if we can get all the hogs and all the

slaughter horses into our hands on the dead quiet--whew! it would take

three ships to carry the money.--I've looked into the thing--calculated

all the chances for and all the chances against, and though I shake my

head and hesitate and keep on thinking, apparently, I've got my mind made

up that if the thing can be done on a capital of six millions, that's the

horse to put up money on!  Why Washington--but what's the use of talking

about it--any man can see that there's whole Atlantic oceans of cash in

it, gulfs and bays thrown in.  But there's a bigger thing than that, yes

bigger----"



"Why Colonel, you can't want anything bigger!" said Washington, his eyes

blazing.  "Oh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations--I

only wish I had money--I wish I wasn't cramped and kept down and fettered

with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in sight!

Oh, it is a fearful thing to be poor.  But don't throw away those things

--they are so splendid and I can see how sure they are.  Don't throw them

away for something still better and maybe fail in it!  I wouldn't,

Colonel.  I would stick to these.  I wish father were here and were his

old self again--Oh, he never in his life had such chances as these are.

Colonel; you can't improve on these--no man can improve on them!"



A sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel's features, and he

leaned over the table with the air of a man who is "going to show you"

and do it without the least trouble:



"Why Washington, my boy, these things are nothing.  They look large of

course--they look large to a novice, but to a man who has been all his

life accustomed to large operations--shaw!  They're well enough to while

away an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give a

trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting for

something to do, but--now just listen a moment--just let me give you an

idea of what we old veterans of commerce call 'business.'  Here's the

Rothschild's proposition--this is between you and me, you understand----"



Washington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes

said, "Yes, yes--hurry--I understand----"



----"for I wouldn't have it get out for a fortune.  They want me to go in

with them on the sly--agent was here two weeks ago about it--go in on the

sly" [voice down to an impressive whisper, now,] "and buy up a hundred

and thirteen wild cat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and

Missouri--notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now--average

discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per cent--buy them all

up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag!  Whiz!

the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a tremendous

premium before you could turn a handspring--profit on the speculation not

a dollar less than forty millions!" [An eloquent pause, while the

marvelous vision settled into W.'s focus.]  "Where's your hogs now?

Why my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the front door-steps

and peddle banks like lucifer matches!"



Washington finally got his breath and said:



"Oh, it is perfectly wonderful!  Why couldn't these things have happened

in father's day?  And I--it's of no use--they simply lie before my face

and mock me.  There is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see other

people reap the astonishing harvest."



"Never mind, Washington, don't you worry.  I'll fix you.  There's plenty

of chances.  How much money have you got?"



In the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from

blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the

world.



"Well, all right--don't despair.  Other people have been obliged to begin

with less.  I have a small idea that may develop into something for us

both, all in good time.  Keep your money close and add to it.  I'll make

it breed.  I've been experimenting (to pass away the time), on a little

preparation for curing sore eyes--a kind of decoction nine-tenths water

and the other tenth drugs that don't cost more than a dollar a barrel;

I'm still experimenting; there's one ingredient wanted yet to perfect the

thing, and somehow I can't just manage to hit upon the thing that's

necessary, and I don't dare talk with a chemist, of course.  But I'm

progressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with the

fame of Beriah Sellers' Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment and

Salvation for Sore Eyes--the Medical Wonder of the Age!  Small bottles

fifty cents, large ones a dollar.  Average cost, five and seven cents for

the two sizes.



"The first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in Missouri, seven

thousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four thousand in Kentucky,

six thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five thousand in the rest of the

country.  Total, fifty five thousand bottles; profit clear of all

expenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation.  All

the capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles--

say a hundred and fifty dollars--then the money would begin to flow in.

The second year, sales would reach 200,000 bottles--clear profit, say,

$75,000--and in the meantime the great factory would be building in St.

Louis, to cost, say, $100,000.  The third year we could, easily sell

1,000,000 bottles in the United States and----"



"O, splendid!" said Washington.  "Let's commence right away--let's----"



"----1,000,000 bottles in the United States--profit at least $350,000--

and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the real

idea of the business."



"The real idea of it!  Ain't $350,000 a year a pretty real----"



"Stuff!  Why what an infant you are, Washington--what a guileless, short-

sighted, easily-contented innocent you, are, my poor little country-bred

know-nothing!  Would I go to all that trouble and bother for the poor

crumbs a body might pick up in this country?  Now do I look like a man

who----does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in trifles,

contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the common herd,

sees no further than the end of his nose?  Now you know that that is not

me--couldn't be me.  You ought to know that if I throw my time and

abilities into a patent medicine, it's a patent medicine whose field of

operations is the solid earth! its clients the swarming nations that

inhabit it!  Why what is the republic of America for an eye-water

country?  Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway that you've

got to cross to get to the true eye-water market!  Why, Washington, in

the Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert; every

square mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling

human creatures--and every separate and individual devil of them's got

the ophthalmia!  It's as natural to them as noses are--and sin.  It's

born with them, it stays with them, it's all that some of them have left

when they die.  Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what

will be the result?  Why, our headquarters would be in Constantinople and

our hindquarters in Further India!  Factories and warehouses in Cairo,

Ispahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking, Bangkok, Delhi,

Bombay--and Calcutta!  Annual income--well, God only knows how many

millions and millions apiece!"



Washington was so dazed, so bewildered--his heart and his eyes had

wandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such

avalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly down

before him, that he was now as one who has been whirling round and round

for a time, and, stopping all at once, finds his surroundings still

whirling and all objects a dancing chaos.  However, little by little the

Sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape, and the poor room

lost its glitter and resumed its poverty.  Then the youth found his voice

and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eye-water; and he

got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the Colonel--pleaded

with him to take it--implored him to do it.  But the Colonel would not;

said he would not need the capital (in his native magnificent way he

called that eighteen dollars Capital) till the eye-water was an

accomplished fact.  He made Washington easy in his mind, though, by

promising that he would call for it just as soon as the invention was

finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but just they two

should be admitted to a share in the speculation.



When Washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that

man.  Washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the

very, clouds one day and in the gutter the next.  He walked on air, now.

The Colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the

employment he had found for him, but Washington begged for a few moments

in which to write home; with his kind of people, to ride to-day's new

interest to death and put off yesterday's till another time, is nature

itself.  He ran up stairs and wrote glowingly, enthusiastically, to his

mother about the hogs and the corn, the banks and the eye-water--and

added a few inconsequential millions to each project.  And he said that

people little dreamed what a man Col. Sellers was, and that the world

would open its eyes when it found out.  And he closed his letter thus:



"So make yourself perfectly easy, mother-in a little while you shall have

everything you want, and more.  I am not likely to stint you in anything,

I fancy.  This money will not be for me, alone, but for all of us.

I want all to share alike; and there is going to be far more for each

than one person can spend.  Break it to father cautiously--you understand

the need of that--break it to him cautiously, for he has had such cruel

hard fortune, and is so stricken by it that great good news might

prostrate him more surely than even bad, for he is used to the bad but

is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other.  Tell Laura--tell all the

children.  And write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet.  You may

tell Clay that whatever I get he can freely share in-freely.  He knows

that that is true--there will be no need that I should swear to that to

make him believe it.  Good-bye--and mind what I say: Rest perfectly easy,

one and all of you, for our troubles are nearly at an end."



Poor lad, he could not know that his mother would cry some loving,

compassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a

synopsis of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to then but not

much idea of his prospects or projects.  And he never dreamed that such a

joyful letter could sadden her and fill her night with sighs, and

troubled thoughts, and bodings of the future, instead of filling it with

peace and blessing it with restful sleep.



When the letter was done, Washington and the Colonel sallied forth, and

as they walked along Washington learned what he was to be.  He was to be

a clerk in a real estate office.  Instantly the fickle youth's dreams

forsook the magic eye-water and flew back to the Tennessee Land.  And the

gorgeous possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy

his imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep

even enough of his attention upon the Colonel's talk to retain the

general run of what he was saying.  He was glad it was a real estate

office--he was a made man now, sure.



The Colonel said that General Boswell was a rich man and had a good and

growing business; and that Washington's work world be light and he would

get forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the General's

family--which was as good as ten dollars more; and even better, for he

could not live as well even at the "City Hotel" as he would there, and

yet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good

room.



General Boswell was in his office; a comfortable looking place, with

plenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows, and

a spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table.  The office

was in the principal street.  The General received Washington with a

kindly but reserved politeness.  Washington rather liked his looks.

He was about fifty years old, dignified, well preserved and well dressed.

After the Colonel took his leave, the General talked a while with

Washington--his talk consisting chiefly of instructions about the

clerical duties of the place.  He seemed satisfied as to Washington's

ability to take care of the books, he was evidently a pretty fair

theoretical bookkeeper, and experience would soon harden theory into

practice.  By and by dinner-time came, and the two walked to the

General's house; and now Washington noticed an instinct in himself that

moved him to keep not in the General's rear, exactly, but yet not at his

side--somehow the old gentleman's dignity and reserve did not inspire

familiarity.









CHAPTER IX



Washington dreamed his way along the street, his fancy flitting from

grain to hogs, from hogs to banks, from banks to eyewater, from eye-water

to Tennessee Land, and lingering but a feverish moment upon each of these

fascinations.  He was conscious of but one outward thing, to wit, the

General, and he was really not vividly conscious of him.



Arrived at the finest dwelling in the town, they entered it and were at

home.  Washington was introduced to Mrs. Boswell, and his imagination was

on the point of flitting into the vapory realms of speculation again,

when a lovely girl of sixteen or seventeen came in.  This vision swept

Washington's mind clear of its chaos of glittering rubbish in an instant.

Beauty had fascinated him before; many times he had been in love even for

weeks at a time with the same object but his heart had never suffered so

sudden and so fierce an assault as this, within his recollection.



Louise Boswell occupied his mind and drifted among his multiplication

tables all the afternoon.  He was constantly catching himself in a

reverie--reveries made up of recalling how she looked when she first

burst upon him; how her voice thrilled him when she first spoke; how

charmed the very air seemed by her presence.  Blissful as the afternoon

was, delivered up to such a revel as this, it seemed an eternity, so

impatient was he to see the girl again.  Other afternoons like it

followed.  Washington plunged into this love affair as he plunged into

everything else--upon impulse and without reflection.  As the days went

by it seemed plain that he was growing in favor with Louise,--not

sweepingly so, but yet perceptibly, he fancied.  His attentions to her

troubled her father and mother a little, and they warned Louise, without

stating particulars or making allusions to any special person, that a

girl was sure to make a mistake who allowed herself to marry anybody but

a man who could support her well.



Some instinct taught Washington that his present lack of money would be

an obstruction, though possibly not a bar, to his hopes, and straightway

his poverty became a torture to him which cast all his former sufferings

under that held into the shade.  He longed for riches now as he had ever

longed for them before.



He had been once or twice to dine with Col. Sellers, and had been

discouraged to note that the Colonel's bill of fare was falling off both

in quantity and quality--a sign, he feared, that the lacking ingredient

in the eye-water still remained undiscovered--though Sellers always

explained that these changes in the family diet had been ordered by the

doctor, or suggested by some new scientific work the Colonel had stumbled

upon.  But it always turned out that the lacking ingredient was still

lacking--though it always appeared, at the same time, that the Colonel

was right on its heels.



Every time the Colonel came into the real estate office Washington's

heart bounded and his eyes lighted with hope, but it always turned out

that the Colonel was merely on the scent of some vast, undefined landed

speculation--although he was customarily able to say that he was nearer

to the all-necessary ingredient than ever, and could almost name the hour

when success would dawn.  And then Washington's heart world sink again

and a sigh would tell when it touched bottom.



About this time a letter came, saying that Judge Hawkins had been ailing

for a fortnight, and was now considered to be seriously ill.  It was

thought best that Washington should come home.  The news filled him with

grief, for he loved and honored his father; the Boswells were touched by

the youth's sorrow, and even the General unbent and said encouraging

things to him.--There was balm in this; but when Louise bade him good-

bye, and shook his hand and said, "Don't be cast down--it will all come

out right--I know it will all come out right," it seemed a blessed thing

to be in misfortune, and the tears that welled up to his eyes were the

messengers of an adoring and a grateful heart; and when the girl saw them

and answering tears came into her own eyes, Washington could hardly

contain the excess of happiness that poured into the cavities of his

breast that were so lately stored to the roof with grief.



All the way home he nursed his woe and exalted it.  He pictured himself

as she must be picturing him: a noble, struggling young spirit persecuted

by misfortune, but bravely and patiently waiting in the shadow of a dread

calamity and preparing to meet the blow as became one who was all too

used to hard fortune and the pitiless buffetings of fate.  These thoughts

made him weep, and weep more broken-heartedly than ever; and be wished

that she could see his sufferings now.



There was nothing significant in the fact that Louise, dreamy and

distraught, stood at her bedroom bureau that night, scribbling

"Washington" here and there over a sheet of paper.  But there was

something significant in the fact that she scratched the word out every

time she wrote it; examined the erasure critically to see if anybody

could guess at what the word had been; then buried it under a maze of

obliterating lines; and finally, as if still unsatisfied, burned the

paper.



When Washington reached home, he recognized at once how serious his

father's case was.  The darkened room, the labored breathing and

occasional moanings of the patient, the tip-toeing of the attendants and

their whispered consultations, were full of sad meaning.  For three or

four nights Mrs. Hawkins and Laura had been watching by the bedside; Clay

had arrived, preceding Washington by one day, and he was now added to the

corps of watchers.  Mr. Hawkins would have none but these three, though

neighborly assistance was offered by old friends.  From this time forth

three-hour watches were instituted, and day and night the watchers kept

their vigils.  By degrees Laura and her mother began to show wear, but

neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to Clay.  He ventured

once to let the midnight hour pass without calling Laura, but he ventured

no more; there was that about her rebuke when he tried to explain, that

taught him that to let her sleep when she might be ministering to her

father's needs, was to rob her of moments that were priceless in her

eyes; he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege to watch, not a

burden.  And, he had noticed, also, that when midnight struck, the

patient turned his eyes toward the door, with an expectancy in them which

presently grew into a longing but brightened into contentment as soon

as the door opened and Laura appeared.  And he did not need Laura's

rebuke when he heard his father say:



"Clay is good, and you are tired, poor child; but I wanted you so."



"Clay is not good, father--he did not call me.  I would not have treated

him so.  How could you do it, Clay?"



Clay begged forgiveness and promised not to break faith again; and as he

betook him to his bed, he said to himself:  "It's a steadfast little

soul; whoever thinks he is doing the Duchess a kindness by intimating

that she is not sufficient for any undertaking she puts her hand to,

makes a mistake; and if I did not know it before, I know now that there

are surer ways of pleasing her than by trying to lighten her labor when

that labor consists in wearing herself out for the sake of a person she

loves."



A week drifted by, and all the while the patient sank lower and lower.

The night drew on that was to end all suspense.  It was a wintry one.

The darkness gathered, the snow was falling, the wind wailed plaintively

about the house or shook it with fitful gusts.  The doctor had paid his

last visit and gone away with that dismal remark to the nearest friend of

the family that he "believed there was nothing more that he could do"--

a remark which is always overheard by some one it is not meant for and

strikes a lingering half-conscious hope dead with a withering shock;

the medicine phials had been removed from the bedside and put out of

sight, and all things made orderly and meet for the solemn event that was

impending; the patient, with closed eyes, lay scarcely breathing; the

watchers sat by and wiped the gathering damps from his forehead while the

silent tears flowed down their faces; the deep hush was only interrupted

by sobs from the children, grouped about the bed.



After a time--it was toward midnight now--Mr. Hawkins roused out of a

doze, looked about him and was evidently trying to speak.  Instantly

Laura lifted his head and in a failing voice he said, while something of

the old light shone in his eyes:



"Wife--children--come nearer--nearer.  The darkness grows.  Let me see

you all, once more."



The group closed together at the bedside, and their tears and sobs came

now without restraint.



"I am leaving you in cruel poverty.  I have been--so foolish--so short-

sighted.  But courage!  A better day is--is coming.  Never lose sight of

the Tennessee Land!  Be wary.  There is wealth stored up for you there--

wealth that is boundless!  The children shall hold up their heads with

the best in the land, yet.  Where are the papers?--Have you got the

papers safe?  Show them--show them to me!"



Under his strong excitement his voice had gathered power and his last

sentences were spoken with scarcely a perceptible halt or hindrance.

With an effort he had raised himself almost without assistance to a

sitting posture.  But now the fire faded out of his eyes and be fell back

exhausted.  The papers were brought and held before him, and the

answering smile that flitted across his face showed that he was

satisfied.  He closed his eyes, and the signs of approaching dissolution

multiplied rapidly.  He lay almost motionless for a little while, then

suddenly partly raised his head and looked about him as one who peers

into a dim uncertain light.  He muttered:



"Gone?  No--I see you--still.  It is--it is-over.  But you are--safe.

Safe.  The Ten-----"



The voice died out in a whisper; the sentence was never finished.  The

emaciated fingers began to pick at the coverlet, a fatal sign.  After a

time there were no sounds but the cries of the mourners within and the

gusty turmoil of the wind without.  Laura had bent down and kissed her

father's lips as the spirit left the body; but she did not sob, or utter

any ejaculation; her tears flowed silently.  Then she closed the dead

eyes, and crossed the hands upon the breast; after a season, she kissed

the forehead reverently, drew the sheet up over the face, and then walked

apart and sat down with the look of one who is done with life and has no

further interest in its joys and sorrows, its hopes or its ambitions.

Clay buried his face in the coverlet of the bed; when the other children

and the mother realized that death was indeed come at last, they threw

themselves into each others' arms and gave way to a frenzy of grief.









CHAPTER X.



Only two or three days had elapsed since the funeral, when something

happened which was to change the drift of Laura's life somewhat, and

influence in a greater or lesser degree the formation of her character.



Major Lackland had once been a man of note in the State--a man of

extraordinary natural ability and as extraordinary learning.  He had been

universally trusted and honored in his day, but had finally, fallen into

misfortune; while serving his third term in Congress, and while upon the

point of being elevated to the Senate--which was considered the summit of

earthly aggrandizement in those days--he had yielded to temptation, when

in distress for money wherewith to save his estate; and sold his vote.

His crime was discovered, and his fall followed instantly.  Nothing could

reinstate him in the confidence of the people, his ruin was

irretrievable--his disgrace complete.  All doors were closed against him,

all men avoided him.  After years of skulking retirement and dissipation,

death had relieved him of his troubles at last, and his funeral followed

close upon that of Mr. Hawkins.  He died as he had latterly lived--wholly

alone and friendless.  He had no relatives--or if he had they did not

acknowledge him.  The coroner's jury found certain memoranda upon his

body and about the premises which revealed a fact not suspected by the

villagers before-viz., that Laura was not the child of Mr. and Mrs.

Hawkins.



The gossips were soon at work.  They were but little hampered by the fact

that the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare circumstance

that Laura's real parents were unknown, and stopped there.  So far from

being hampered by this, the gossips seemed to gain all the more freedom

from it.  They supplied all the missing information themselves, they

filled up all the blanks.  The town soon teemed with histories of Laura's

origin and secret history, no two versions precisely alike, but all

elaborate, exhaustive, mysterious and interesting, and all agreeing in

one vital particular-to-wit, that there was a suspicious cloud about her

birth, not to say a disreputable one.



Laura began to encounter cold looks, averted eyes and peculiar nods and

gestures which perplexed her beyond measure; but presently the pervading

gossip found its way to her, and she understood them--then.  Her pride

was stung.  She was astonished, and at first incredulous.  She was about

to ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports, but upon

second thought held her peace.  She soon gathered that Major Lackland's

memoranda seemed to refer to letters which had passed between himself and

Judge Hawkins.  She shaped her course without difficulty the day that

that hint reached her.



That night she sat in her room till all was still, and then she stole

into the garret and began a search.  She rummaged long among boxes of

musty papers relating to business matters of no, interest to her, but at

last she found several bundles of letters.  One bundle was marked

"private," and in that she found what she wanted.  She selected six or

eight letters from the package and began to devour their contents,

heedless of the cold.



By the dates, these letters were from five to seven years old.  They were

all from Major Lackland to Mr. Hawkins.  The substance of them was, that

some one in the east had been inquiring of Major Lackland about a lost

child and its parents, and that it was conjectured that the child might

be Laura.



Evidently some of the letters were missing, for the name of the inquirer

was not mentioned; there was a casual reference to "this handsome-

featured aristocratic gentleman," as if the reader and the writer were

accustomed to speak of him and knew who was meant.



In one letter the Major said he agreed with Mr. Hawkins that the inquirer

seemed not altogether on the wrong track; but he also agreed that it

would be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments were

forthcoming.



Another letter said that "the poor soul broke completely down when be saw

Laura's picture, and declared it must be she."



Still another said:



     "He seems entirely alone in the world, and his heart is so wrapped

     up in this thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope, it

     would kill him; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go

     west when I go."



Another letter had this paragraph in it:



     "He is better one day and worse the next, and is out of his mind a

     good deal of the time.  Lately his case has developed a something

     which is a wonder to the hired nurses, but which will not be much of

     a marvel to you if you have read medical philosophy much.  It is

     this: his lost memory returns to him when he is delirious, and goes

     away again when he is himself-just as old Canada Joe used to talk

     the French patois of his boyhood in the delirium of typhus fever,

     though he could not do it when his mind was clear.  Now this poor

     gentleman's memory has always broken down before he reached the

     explosion of the steamer; he could only remember starting up the

     river with his wife and child, and he had an idea that there was a

     race, but he was not certain; he could not name the boat he was on;

     there was a dead blank of a month or more that supplied not an item

     to his recollection.  It was not for me to assist him, of course.

     But now in his delirium it all comes out: the names of the boats,

     every incident of the explosion, and likewise the details of his

     astonishing escape--that is, up to where, just as a yawl-boat was

     approaching him (he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the

     burning wreck at the time), a falling timber struck him on the head.

     But I will write out his wonderful escape in full to-morrow or next

     day.  Of course the physicians will not let me tell him now that our

     Laura is indeed his child--that must come later, when his health is

     thoroughly restored.  His case is not considered dangerous at all;

     he will recover presently, the doctors say.  But they insist that he

     must travel a little when he gets well--they recommend a short sea

     voyage, and they say he can be persuaded to try it if we continue to

     keep him in ignorance and promise to let him see L. as soon as he

     returns."



The letter that bore the latest date of all, contained this clause:



     "It is the most unaccountable thing in the world; the mystery

     remains as impenetrable as ever; I have hunted high and low for him,

     and inquired of everybody, but in vain; all trace of him ends at

     that hotel in New York; I never have seen or heard of him since,

     up to this day; he could hardly have sailed, for his name does not

     appear upon the books of any shipping office in New York or Boston

     or Baltimore.  How fortunate it seems, now, that we kept this thing

     to ourselves; Laura still has a father in you, and it is better for

     her that we drop this subject here forever."



That was all.  Random remarks here and there, being pieced together gave

Laura a vague impression of a man of fine presence, abort forty-three or

forty-five years of age, with dark hair and eyes, and a slight limp in

his walk--it was not stated which leg was defective.  And this indistinct

shadow represented her father.  She made an exhaustive search for the

missing letters, but found none.  They had probably been burned; and she

doubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would have shared the same

fate if Mr. Hawkins had not been a dreamer, void of method, whose mind

was perhaps in a state of conflagration over some bright new speculation

when he received them.



She sat long, with the letters in her lap, thinking--and unconsciously

freezing.  She felt like a lost person who has traveled down a long lane

in good hope of escape, and, just as the night descends finds his

progress barred by a bridge-less river whose further shore, if it has

one, is lost in the darkness.  If she could only have found these letters

a month sooner!  That was her thought.  But now the dead had carried

their secrets with them.  A dreary, melancholy settled down upon her.

An undefined sense of injury crept into her heart.  She grew very

miserable.



She had just reached the romantic age--the age when there is a sad

sweetness, a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a mystery

connected with her birth, which no other piece of good luck can afford.

She had more than her rightful share of practical good sense, but still

she was human; and to be human is to have one's little modicum of romance

secreted away in one's composition.  One never ceases to make a hero of

one's self, (in private,) during life, but only alters the style of his

heroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle certain gods of

his admiration and raise up others in their stead that seem greater.



The recent wearing days and nights of watching, and the wasting grief

that had possessed her, combined with the profound depression that

naturally came with the reaction of idleness, made Laura peculiarly

susceptible at this time to romantic impressions.  She was a heroine,

now, with a mysterious father somewhere.  She could not really tell

whether she wanted to find him and spoil it all or not; but still all the

traditions of romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual and

necessary, course to follow; therefore she would some day begin the

search when opportunity should offer.



Now a former thought struck her--she would speak to Mrs. Hawkins.

And naturally enough Mrs. Hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment.



She said she knew all--she knew that Laura had discovered the secret that

Mr. Hawkins, the elder children, Col. Sellers and herself had kept so

long and so faithfully; and she cried and said that now that troubles had

begun they would never end; her daughter's love would wean itself away

from her and her heart would break.  Her grief so wrought upon Laura that

the girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her compassion

for her mother's distress.  Finally Mrs. Hawkins said:



"Speak to me, child--do not forsake me.  Forget all this miserable talk.

Say I am your mother!--I have loved you so long, and there is no other.

I am your mother, in the sight of God, and nothing shall ever take you

from me!"



All barriers fell, before this appeal.  Laura put her arms about her

mother's neck and said:



"You are my mother, and always shall be.  We will be as we have always

been; and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or

make us less to each other than we are this hour."



There was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between them.

Indeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been before.

By and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked long and

earnestly about Laura's history and the letters.  But it transpired that

Mrs. Hawkins had never known of this correspondence between her husband

and Major Lackland.  With his usual consideration for his wife, Mr.

Hawkins had shielded her from the worry the matter would have caused her.



Laura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in

tranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation.

She was pensive, the next day, and subdued; but that was not matter for

remark, for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in

that respect.  Clay and Washington were the same loving and admiring

brothers now that they had always been.  The great secret was new to some

of the younger children, but their love suffered no change under the

wonderful revelation.



It is barely possible that things might have presently settled down into

their old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic

sublimity in Laura's eyes, if the village gossips could have quieted

down.  But they could not quiet down and they did not.  Day after day

they called at the house, ostensibly upon visits of condolence, and they

pumped away at the mother and the children without seeming to know that

their questionings were in bad taste.  They meant no harm they only

wanted to know.  Villagers always want to know.



The family fought shy of the questionings, and of course that was high

testimony "if the Duchess was respectably born, why didn't they come out

and prove it?--why did they, stick to that poor thin story about picking

her up out of a steamboat explosion?"



Under this ceaseless persecution, Laura's morbid self-communing was

renewed.  At night the day's contribution of detraction, innuendo and

malicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind, and then she would

drift into a course of thinking.  As her thoughts ran on, the indignant

tears would spring to her eyes, and she would spit out fierce little

ejaculations at intervals.  But finally she would grow calmer and say

some comforting disdainful thing--something like this:



"But who are they?--Animals!  What are their opinions to me?  Let them

talk--I will not stoop to be affected by it.  I could hate----.

Nonsense--nobody I care for or in any way respect is changed toward me,

I fancy."



She may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals, but it was

not so--she was thinking of only one.  And her heart warmed somewhat,

too, the while.  One day a friend overheard a conversation like this:--

and naturally came and told her all about it:



"Ned, they say you don't go there any more.  How is that?"



"Well, I don't; but I tell you it's not because I don't want to and it's

not because I think it is any matter who her father was or who he wasn't,

either; it's only on account of this talk, talk, talk.  I think she is a

fine girl every way, and so would you if you knew her as well as I do;

but you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about--it's all up

with her--the world won't ever let her alone, after that."



The only comment Laura made upon this revelation, was:



"Then it appears that if this trouble had not occurred I could have had

the happiness of Mr. Ned Thurston's serious attentions.  He is well

favored in person, and well liked, too, I believe, and comes of one of

the first families of the village.  He is prosperous, too, I hear; has

been a doctor a year, now, and has had two patients--no, three, I think;

yes, it was three.  I attended their funerals.  Well, other people have

hoped and been disappointed; I am not alone in that.  I wish you could

stay to dinner, Maria--we are going to have sausages; and besides,

I wanted to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and

see us when we are settled there."



But Maria could not stay.  She had come to mingle romantic tears with

Laura's over the lover's defection and had found herself dealing with a

heart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its

interest was all centred in sausages.



But as soon as Maria was gone, Laura stamped her expressive foot and

said:



"The coward!  Are all books lies?  I thought he would fly to the front,

and be brave and noble, and stand up for me against all the world, and

defy my enemies, and wither these gossips with his scorn!  Poor crawling

thing, let him go.  I do begin to despise thin world!"



She lapsed into thought.  Presently she said:



"If the time ever comes, and I get a chance, Oh, I'll----"



She could not find a word that was strong enough, perhaps.  By and by she

said:



"Well, I am glad of it--I'm glad of it.  I never cared anything for him

anyway!"



And then, with small consistency, she cried a little, and patted her foot

more indignantly than ever.







CHAPTER XI



Two months had gone by and the Hawkins family were domiciled in Hawkeye.

Washington was at work in the real estate office again, and was

alternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened that

Louise was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent--because indifference

or preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was thinking of

some other young person.  Col. Sellers had asked him several times, to

dine with him, when he first returned to Hawkeye, but Washington, for no

particular reason, had not accepted.  No particular reason except one

which he preferred to keep to himself--viz. that he could not bear to be

away from Louise.  It occurred to him, now, that the Colonel had not

invited him lately--could he be offended?  He resolved to go that very

day, and give the Colonel a pleasant surprise.  It was a good idea;

especially as Louise had absented herself from breakfast that morning,

and torn his heart; he would tear hers, now, and let her see how it felt.



The Sellers family were just starting to dinner when Washington burst

upon them with his surprise.  For an instant the Colonel looked

nonplussed, and just a bit uncomfortable; and Mrs. Sellers looked

actually distressed; but the next moment the head of the house was

himself again, and exclaimed:



"All right, my boy, all right--always glad to see you--always glad to

hear your voice and take you by the hand.  Don't wait for special

invitations--that's all nonsense among friends.  Just come whenever you

can, and come as often as you can--the oftener the better.  You can't

please us any better than that, Washington; the little woman will tell

you so herself.  We don't pretend to style.  Plain folks, you know--plain

folks.  Just a plain family dinner, but such as it is, our friends are

always welcome, I reckon you know that yourself, Washington.  Run along,

children, run along; Lafayette,--[**In those old days the average man

called his children after his most revered literary and historical idols;

consequently there was hardly a family, at least in the West, but had a

Washington in it--and also a Lafayette, a Franklin, and six or eight

sounding names from Byron, Scott, and the Bible, if the offspring held

out.  To visit such a family, was to find one's self confronted by a

congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the

majestic dead of all the ages.  There was something thrilling about it,

to a stranger, not to say awe inspiring.]--stand off the cat's tail,

child, can't you see what you're doing?--Come, come, come, Roderick Dhu,

it isn't nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen's coat tails--

but never mind him, Washington, he's full of spirits and don't mean any

harm.  Children will be children, you know.  Take the chair next to Mrs.

Sellers, Washington--tut, tut, Marie Antoinette, let your brother have

the fork if he wants it, you are bigger than he is."



Washington contemplated the banquet, and wondered if he were in his right

mind.  Was this the plain family dinner?  And was it all present?  It was

soon apparent that this was indeed the dinner: it was all on the table:

it consisted of abundance of clear, fresh water, and a basin of raw

turnips--nothing more.



Washington stole a glance at Mrs. Sellers's face, and would have given

the world, the next moment, if he could have spared her that.  The poor

woman's face was crimson, and the tears stood in her eyes.  Washington

did not know what to do.  He wished he had never come there and spied out

this cruel poverty and brought pain to that poor little lady's heart and

shame to her cheek; but he was there, and there was no escape.  Col.

Sellers hitched back his coat sleeves airily from his wrists as who

should say "Now for solid enjoyment!" seized a fork, flourished it and

began to harpoon turnips and deposit them in the plates before him "Let

me help you, Washington--Lafyette pass this plate Washington--ah, well,

well, my boy, things are looking pretty bright, now, I tell you.

Speculation--my! the whole atmosphere's full of money.  I would'nt take

three fortunes for one little operation I've got on hand now--have

anything from the casters?  No?  Well, you're right, you're right.  Some

people like mustard with turnips, but--now there was Baron Poniatowski--

Lord, but that man did know how to live!--true Russian you know, Russian

to the back bone; I say to my wife, give me a Russian every time, for a

table comrade.  The Baron used to say, 'Take mustard, Sellers, try the

mustard,--a man can't know what turnips are in perfection without,

mustard,' but I always said, 'No, Baron, I'm a plain man and I want my

food plain--none of your embellishments for Beriah Sellers--no made

dishes for me!  And it's the best way--high living kills more than it

cures in this world, you can rest assured of that.--Yes indeed,

Washington, I've got one little operation on hand that--take some more

water--help yourself, won't you?--help yourself, there's plenty of it.

--You'll find it pretty good, I guess.  How does that fruit strike you?"



Washington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better.  He did

not add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked loathed them

in their natural state.  No, he kept this to himself, and praised the

turnips to the peril of his soul.



"I thought you'd like them.  Examine them--examine them--they'll bear it.

See how perfectly firm and juicy they are--they can't start any like them

in this part of the country, I can tell you.  These are from New Jersey

--I imported them myself.  They cost like sin, too; but lord bless me,

I go in for having the best of a thing, even if it does cost a little

more--it's the best economy, in the long run.  These are the Early

Malcolm--it's a turnip that can't be produced except in just one orchard,

and the supply never is up to the demand.  Take some more water,

Washington--you can't drink too much water with fruit--all the doctors

say that.  The plague can't come where this article is, my boy!"



"Plague?  What plague?"



"What plague, indeed?  Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated

London a couple of centuries ago."



"But how does that concern us?  There is no plague here, I reckon."



"Sh! I've let it out!  Well, never mind--just keep it to yourself.

Perhaps I oughtn't said anything, but its bound to come out sooner or

later, so what is the odds?  Old McDowells wouldn't like me to--to--

bother it all, I'll jest tell the whole thing and let it go.  You see,

I've been down to St. Louis, and I happened to run across old Dr.

McDowells--thinks the world of me, does the doctor.  He's a man that

keeps himself to himself, and well he may, for he knows that he's got a

reputation that covers the whole earth--he won't condescend to open

himself out to many people, but lord bless you, he and I are just like

brothers; he won't let me go to a hotel when I'm in the city--says I'm

the only man that's company to him, and I don't know but there's some

truth in it, too, because although I never like to glorify myself and

make a great to-do over what I am or what I can do or what I know,

I don't mind saying here among friends that I am better read up in most

sciences, maybe, than the general run of professional men in these days.

Well, the other day he let me into a little secret, strictly on the

quiet, about this matter of the plague.



"You see it's booming right along in our direction--follows the Gulf

Stream, you know, just as all those epidemics do, and within three months

it will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind!  And whoever

it touches can make his will and contract for the funeral.  Well you

can't cure it, you know, but you can prevent it.  How?  Turnips! that's

it!  Turnips and water!  Nothing like it in the world, old McDowells

says, just fill yourself up two or three times a day, and you can snap

your fingers at the plague.  Sh!--keep mum, but just you confine yourself

to that diet and you're all right.  I wouldn't have old McDowells know

that I told about it for anything--he never would speak to me again.

Take some more water, Washington--the more water you drink, the better.

Here, let me give you some more of the turnips.  No, no, no, now, I

insist.  There, now.  Absorb those.  They're, mighty sustaining--brim

full of nutriment--all the medical books say so.  Just eat from four to

seven good-sized turnips at a meal, and drink from a pint and a half to a

quart of water, and then just sit around a couple of hours and let them

ferment.  You'll feel like a fighting cock next day."



Fifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel's tongue was still chattering

away--he had piled up several future fortunes out of several incipient

"operations" which he had blundered into within the past week, and was

now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of late

promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye-water.

And at such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic

listener, but he was not, for two matters disturbed his mind and

distracted his attention.  One was, that he discovered, to his confusion

and shame, that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the

turnips, he had robbed those hungry children.  He had not needed the

dreadful "fruit," and had not wanted it; and when he saw the pathetic

sorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to

give them, he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing

young things with all his heart.  The other matter that disturbed him was

the dire inflation that had begun in his stomach.  It grew and grew, it

became more and more insupportable.  Evidently the turnips were

"fermenting."  He forced himself to sit still as long as he could, but

his anguish conquered him at last.



He rose in the midst of the Colonel's talk and excused himself on the

plea of a previous engagement.  The Colonel followed him to the door,

promising over and over again that he would use his influence to get some

of the Early Malcolms for him, and insisting that he should not be such a

stranger but come and take pot-luck with him every chance he got.

Washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again.  He

immediately bent his steps toward home.



In bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray, and then

a blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with

gratitude.  Weak and languid, he made shift to turn himself about and

seek rest and sleep; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of

unconciousness, he heaved a long, deep sigh, and said to himself that in

his heart he had cursed the Colonel's preventive of rheumatism, before,

and now let the plague come if it must--he was done with preventives;

if ever any man beguiled him with turnips and water again, let him die

the death.



If he dreamed at all that night, no gossiping spirit disturbed his

visions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in the

East, more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few years

would develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate and

fortunes of the Hawkins family.









CHAPTER XII



"Oh, it's easy enough to make a fortune," Henry said.



"It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think," replied Philip.



"Well, why don't you go into something?  You'll never dig it out of the

Astor Library."



If there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy

to "go into something" it is in Broadway on a spring morning, when one is

walking city-ward, and has before him the long lines of palace-shops with

an occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the lower

town, and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic.



To the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are

innumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success in

all his wide horizon.  He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not

unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving

himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object.  He has no

traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away

from the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for

himself.



Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for

ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he

felt that he could be a rich man.  He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere

desire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated

about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.  He never

walked Broadway, a part of its tide of abundant shifting life, without

feeling something of the flush of wealth, and unconsciously taking the

elastic step of one well-to-do in this prosperous world.



Especially at night in the crowded theatre--Philip was too young to

remember the old Chambers' Street box, where the serious Burton led his

hilarious and pagan crew--in the intervals of the screaming comedy, when

the orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes, the

world seemed full of opportunities to Philip, and his heart exulted with

a conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck.



Perhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting, on the stage, where

virtue had its reward in three easy acts, perhaps it was the excessive

light of the house, or the music, or the buzz of the excited talk between

acts, perhaps it was youth which believed everything, but for some reason

while Philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence in life and

his ready victory in it.



Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap

sentiment and high and mighty dialogue!  Will there not always be rosin

enough for the squeaking fiddle-bow?



Do we not all like the maudlin hero, who is sneaking round the right

entrance, in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical

neighbor from the paste-board cottage at the left entrance? and when he

advances down to the foot-lights and defiantly informs the audience that,

"he who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness," do we

not all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence?



Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who

should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned

afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any

exception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.



The fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted

several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth.  The modest

fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement;

it might be for a book, or for the skillful management of some great

newspaper, or for some daring expedition like that of Lt. Strain or Dr.

Kane.  He was unable to decide exactly what it should be.  Sometimes he

thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach

the gospel of repentance; and it even crossed his mind that it would be

noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region,

where the date-palm grows, and the nightingale's voice is in tune, and

the bul-bul sings on the off nights.  If he were good enough he would

attach himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary,

who were seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry.



Philip was a New England boy and had graduated at Yale; he had not

carried off with him all the learning of that venerable institution, but

he knew some things that were not in the regular course of study.  A very

good use of the English language and considerable knowledge of its

literature was one of them; he could sing a song very well, not in time

to be sure, but with enthusiasm; he could make a magnetic speech at a

moment's notice in the class room, the debating society, or upon any

fence or dry-goods box that was convenient; he could lift himself by one

arm, and do the giant swing in the gymnasium; he could strike out from

his left shoulder; he could handle an oar like a professional and pull

stroke in a winning race.  Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper,

and a clear hearty laugh.  He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart,

a broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face.  He was six feet

high, with broad shoulders, long legs and a swinging gait; one of those

loose-jointed, capable fellows, who saunter into the world with a free

air and usually make a stir in whatever company they enter.



After he left college Philip took the advice of friends and read law.

Law seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover a

practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law, and all

the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante-room of the law

office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle--no

matter how, but settle--greatly to the disgust of his employer, who knew

that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized

processes, with the attendant fees.  Besides Philip hated the copying of

pleadings, and he was certain that a life of "whereases" and "aforesaids"

and whipping the devil round the stump, would be intolerable.



[Note: these few paragraphs are nearly an autobiography of the life of

Charles Dudley Warner whose contributions to the story start here with

Chapter XII.  D.W.]



His pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into

other scribbling.  In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers

accepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page,

and, behold, his vocation was open to him.  He would make his mark in

literature.



Life has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes himself

called into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature.  It is such

a noble ambition, that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow

foundation.



At the time of this history, Philip had gone to New York for a career.

With his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting an

editorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper; not that he knew

anything about news paper work, or had the least idea of journalism; he

knew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate

departments, but he could write leaders with perfect ease, he was sure.

The drudgery of the newspaper office was too distaste ful, and besides it

would be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine

writer.  He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.



To his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial department

of the journals was full, always had been full, was always likely to be

full.  It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius,

but mere plodding and grubbing.  Philip therefore read diligently in the

Astor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and

nursed his genius.  He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into

the Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and

women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine,

and see what he could get a line for it.



One day he had an offer from some country friends, who believed in him,

to take charge of a provincial daily newspaper, and he went to consult

Mr. Gringo--Gringo who years ago managed the Atlas--about taking the

situation.



"Take it of course," says Gringo, take anything that offers, why not?"



"But they want me to make it an opposition paper."



"Well, make it that.  That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect

the next president."



"I don't believe it," said Philip, stoutly, "its wrong in principle, and

it ought not to succeed, but I don't see how I can go for a thing I don't

believe in."



"O, very well," said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt,

"you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you

can't afford a conscience like that."



But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and

declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to

fail.  And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening

large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.



It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one

morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly.  He frequently

accompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office

in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with regularity

every day.  It was evident to the most casual acquaintance that he was a

man of affairs, and that his time was engrossed in the largest sort of

operations, about which there was a mysterious air.  His liability to be

suddenly summoned to Washington, or Boston or Montreal or even to

Liverpool was always imminent.  He never was so summoned, but none of his

acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone

to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of

Commerce.



The two were intimate at that time,--they had been class, mates--and saw

a great deal of each other.  Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street,

in a boarding-house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially

feeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone

their several ways into fame or into obscurity.



It was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that

Henry Brierly suddenly said, "Philip, how would you like to go to

St. Jo?"



"I think I should like it of all things," replied Philip, with some

hesitation, "but what for."



"Oh, it's a big operation.  We are going, a lot of us, railroad men,

engineers, contractors.  You know my uncle is a great railroad man.  I've

no doubt I can get you a chance to go if you'll go."



"But in what capacity would I go?"



"Well, I'm going as an engineer.  You can go as one."



"I don't know an engine from a coal cart."



"Field engineer, civil engineer.  You can begin by carrying a rod, and

putting down the figures.  It's easy enough.  I'll show you about that.

We'll get Trautwine and some of those books."



"Yes, but what is it for, what is it all about?"



"Why don't you see?  We lay out a line, spot the good land, enter it up,

know where the stations are to be, spot them, buy lots; there's heaps of

money in it.  We wouldn't engineer long."



"When do you go?" was Philip's next question, after some moments of

silence.



"To-morrow.  Is that too soon?"



"No, its not too soon.  I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.

The fact is, Henry, that I'm about tired of trying to force myself into

things, and am quite willing to try floating with the stream for a while,

and see where I will land.  This seems like a providential call; it's

sudden enough."



The two young men who were by this time full of the adventure, went down

to the Wall street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that wily

operator.  The uncle knew Philip very well, and was pleased with his

frank enthusiasm, and willing enough to give him a trial in the western

venture.  It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are

settled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company

next morning for the west.



On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and

suits of India-rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and

probably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed

anywhere.



The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would

not take such an important step without informing his friends.  If they

disapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know.  Happy

youth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an

hour's notice.



"By the way," calls out Philip from his bed-room, to Henry, "where is

St. Jo.?"



"Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think.  We'll get a

map."



"Never mind the map.  We will find the place itself.  I was afraid it was

nearer home."



Philip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and

glowing anticipations of his new opening.  He wouldn't bother her with

business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she

would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to

the comfort of her advancing years.



To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York

capitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which

would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer

him a business opening.  He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he

had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.



It was to Ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last.  He might never see her

again; he went to seek his fortune.  He well knew the perils of the

frontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the

dangers of fever.  But there was no real danger to a person who took care

of himself.  Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life.

If he returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps.  If he was

unsuccessful, or if he never returned--perhaps it would be as well.

No time or distance, however, would ever lessen his interest in her.  He

would say good-night, but not good-bye.



In the soft beginning of a Spring morning, long before New York had

breakfasted, while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of

the metropolis, our young adventurers made their way to the Jersey City

railway station of the Erie road, to begin the long, swinging, crooked

journey, over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked

rails and cows, to the West.









CHAPTER XIII.



          What ever to say be toke in his entente,

          his langage was so fayer & pertynante,

          yt semeth unto manys herying not only the worde,

          but veryly the thyng.

                              Caxton's Book of Curtesye.



In the party of which our travelers found themselves members, was Duff

Brown, the great railroad contractor, and subsequently a well-known

member of Congress; a bluff, jovial Bost'n man, thick-set, close shaven,

with a heavy jaw and a low forehead--a very pleasant man if you were not

in his way.  He had government contracts also, custom houses and dry

docks, from Portland to New Orleans, and managed to get out of congress,

in appropriations, about weight for weight of gold for the stone

furnished.



Associated with him, and also of this party, was Rodney Schaick, a sleek

New York broker, a man as prominent in the church as in the stock

exchange, dainty in his dress, smooth of speech, the necessary complement

of Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and adroitness.



It would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party one that shook

off more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic strictness, and

took the world with good-natured allowance.  Money was plenty for every

attainable luxury, and there seemed to be no doubt that its supply would

continue, and that fortunes were about to be made without a great deal of

toil.  Even Philip soon caught the prevailing spirit; Barry did not need

any inoculation, he always talked in six figures.  It was as natural for

the dear boy to be rich as it is for most people to be poor.



The elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact, which

almost all travelers to the west soon find out; that the water was poor.

It must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had brandy

flasks with which to qualify the water of the country; and it was no

doubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that they

kept experimenting, mixing a little of the dangerous and changing fluid,

as they passed along, with the contents of the flasks, thus saving their

lives hour by hour.  Philip learned afterwards that temperance and the

strict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of deportment are

geographical habits, which people do not usually carry with them away

from home.



Our travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could make

their fortunes there in two week's tine, but it did not seem worth while;

the west was more attractive; the further one went the wider the

opportunities opened.



They took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to St. Louis,

for the change and to have a glimpse of the river.



"Isn't this jolly?" cried Henry, dancing out of the barber's room, and

coming down the deck with a one, two, three step, shaven, curled and

perfumed after his usual exquisite fashion.



"What's jolly?" asked Philip, looking out upon the dreary and monotonous

waste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way.



"Why, the whole thing; it's immense I can tell you.  I wouldn't give that

to be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a year's time."



"Where's Mr. Brown?"



"He is in the saloon, playing poker with Schaick and that long haired

party with the striped trousers, who scrambled aboard when the stage

plank was half hauled in, and the big Delegate to Congress from out

west."



"That's a fine looking fellow, that delegate, with his glossy, black

whiskers; looks like a Washington man; I shouldn't think he'd be at

poker."



"Oh, its only five cent ante, just to make it interesting, the Delegate

said."



"But I shouldn't think a representative in Congress would play poker any

way in a public steamboat."



"Nonsense, you've got to pass the time.  I tried a hand myself, but those

old fellows are too many for me.  The Delegate knows all the points.

I'd bet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the United

States Senate when his territory comes in.  He's got the cheek for it."



"He has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public man,

for one thing," added Philip.



"Harry," said Philip, after a pause, "what have you got on those big

boots for; do you expect to wade ashore?"



"I'm breaking 'em in."



The fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper costume

for a new country, and was in appearance a sort of compromise between a

dandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman.  Harry, with blue eyes, fresh

complexion, silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair, was as handsome as

a fashion plate.  He wore this morning a soft hat, a short cutaway coat,

an open vest displaying immaculate linen, a leathern belt round his

waist, and top-boots of soft leather, well polished, that came above his

knees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them up.  The

light hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his well

shaped legs, and told Philip that they were a perfect protection against

prairie rattle-snakes, which never strike above the knee.



The landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers

left Chicago.  It was a genial spring day when they landed at St. Louis;

the birds were singing, the blossoms of peach trees in city garden plots,

made the air sweet, and in the roar and tumult on the long river levee

they found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful

anticipations.



The party went to the Southern Hotel, where the great Duff Brown was very

well known, and indeed was a man of so much importance that even the

office clerk was respectful to him.  He might have respected in him also

a certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money, which the clerk greatly

admired.



The young fellows liked the house and liked the city; it seemed to them a

mighty free and hospitable town.  Coming from the East they were struck

with many peculiarities.  Everybody smoked in the streets, for one thing,

they noticed; everybody "took a drink" in an open manner whenever he

wished to do so or was asked, as if the habit needed no concealment or

apology.  In the evening when they walked about they found people sitting

on the door-steps of their dwellings, in a manner not usual in a northern

city; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks were

filled with chairs and benches--Paris fashion, said Harry--upon which

people lounged in these warm spring evenings, smoking, always smoking;

and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air.  It was

delightful.



Harry at once found on landing that his back-woods custom would not be

needed in St. Louis, and that, in fact, he had need of all the resources

of his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town.  But this

did not much matter, for Harry was always superior to his clothes.

As they were likely to be detained some time in the city, Harry told

Philip that he was going to improve his time.  And he did.  It was an

encouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise,

carefully dress himself, eat his breakfast deliberately, smoke his cigar

tranquilly, and then repair to his room, to what he called his work, with

a grave and occupied manner, but with perfect cheerfulness.



Harry would take off his coat, remove his cravat, roll up his shirt-

sleeves, give his curly hair the right touch before the glass, get out

his book on engineering, his boxes of instruments, his drawing paper,

his profile paper, open the book of logarithms, mix his India ink,

sharpen his pencils, light a cigar, and sit down at the table to "lay out

a line," with the most grave notion that he was mastering the details of

engineering.  He would spend half a day in these preparations without

ever working out a problem or having the faintest conception of the use

of lines or logarithms.  And when he had finished, he had the most

cheerful confidence that he had done a good day's work.



It made no difference, however, whether Harry was in his room in a hotel

or in a tent, Philip soon found, he was just the same.  In camp he would

get himself, up in the most elaborate toilet at his command, polish his

long boots to the top, lay out his work before him, and spend an hour or

longer, if anybody was looking at him, humming airs, knitting his brows,

and "working" at engineering; and if a crowd of gaping rustics were

looking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him.



"You see," he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus

engaged, "I want to get the theory of this thing, so that I can have a

check on the engineers."



"I thought you were going to be an engineer yourself,"  queried Philip.



"Not many times, if the court knows herself.  There's better game.  Brown

and Schaick have, or will have, the control for the whole line of the

Salt Lick Pacific Extension, forty thousand dollars a mile over the

prairie, with extra for hard-pan--and it'll be pretty much all hardpan

I can tell you; besides every alternate section of land on this line.

There's millions in the job.  I'm to have the sub-contract for the first

fifty miles, and you can bet it's a soft thing."



"I'll tell you what you do, Philip," continued Larry, in a burst of

generosity, "if I don't get you into my contract, you'll be with the

engineers, and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a

depot, buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will

be, and we'll turn a hundred or so on that.  I'll advance the money for

the payments, and you can sell the lots.  Schaick is going to let me have

ten thousand just for a flyer in such operations."



"But that's a good deal of money."



"Wait till you are used to handling money.  I didn't come out here for a

bagatelle.  My uncle wanted me to stay East and go in on the Mobile

custom house, work up the Washington end of it; he said there was a

fortune in it for a smart young fellow, but I preferred to take the

chances out here.  Did I tell you I had an offer from Bobbett and Fanshaw

to go into their office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten

thousand?"



"Why didn't you take it ?" asked Philip, to whom a salary of two thousand

would have seemed wealth, before he started on this journey.



"Take it?  I'd rather operate on my own hook;" said Harry, in his most

airy manner.



A few evenings after their arrival at the Southern, Philip and Harry made

the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman, whom they had frequently

seen before about the hotel corridors, and passed a casual word with.  He

had the air of a man of business, and was evidently a person of

importance.



The precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial

form of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself, and

occurred in this wise.  Meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening,

he asked them to give him the time, and added:



"Excuse me, gentlemen--strangers in St. Louis?  Ah, yes-yes.  From the

East, perhaps?  Ah; just so, just so.  Eastern born myself--Virginia.

Sellers is my name--Beriah Sellers.



"Ah! by the way--New York, did you say?  That reminds me; just met some

gentlemen from your State, a week or two ago--very prominent gentlemen--

in public life they are; you must know them, without doubt.  Let me see--

let me see.  Curious those names have escaped me.  I know they were from

your State, because I remember afterward my old friend Governor Shackleby

said to me--fine man, is the Governor--one of the finest men our country

has produced--said he, 'Colonel, how did you like those New York

gentlemen?--not many such men in the world,--Colonel Sellers,' said the

Governor--yes, it was New York he said--I remember it distinctly.

I can't recall those names, somehow.  But no matter.  Stopping here,

gentlemen--stopping at the Southern?"



In shaping their reply in their minds, the title "Mr." had a place in it;

but when their turn had arrived to speak, the title "Colonel" came from

their lips instead.



They said yes, they were abiding at the Southern, and thought it a very

good house.



"Yes, yes, the Southern is fair.  I myself go to the Planter's, old,

aristocratic house.  We Southern gentlemen don't change our ways, you

know.  I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye--my

plantation is in Hawkeye, a little up in the country.  You should know

the Planter's."



Philip and Harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had been

so famous in its day--a cheerful hostelrie, Philip said it must have been

where duels were fought there across the dining-room table.



"You may believe it, sir, an uncommonly pleasant lodging.  Shall we

walk?"



And the three strolled along the streets, the Colonel talking all the way

in the most liberal and friendly manner, and with a frank open-

heartedness that inspired confidence.



"Yes, born East myself, raised all along, know the West--a great country,

gentlemen.  The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a fortune,

simply pick it up, it's lying round loose here.  Not a day that I don't

put aside an opportunity; too busy to look into it.  Management of my own

property takes my time.  First visit?  Looking for an opening?"



"Yes, looking around," replied Harry.



"Ah, here we are.  You'd rather sit here in front than go to my

apartments?  So had I. An opening eh?"



The Colonel's eyes twinkled.  "Ah, just so.  The country is opening up,

all we want is capital to develop it.  Slap down the rails and bring the

land into market.  The richest land on God Almighty's footstool is lying

right out there.  If I had my capital free I could plant it for

millions."



"I suppose your capital is largely in your plantation?" asked Philip.



"Well, partly, sir, partly.  I'm down here now with reference to a little

operation--a little side thing merely.  By the way gentlemen, excuse the

liberty, but it's about my usual time"--



The Colonel paused, but as no movement of his acquaintances followed this

plain remark, he added, in an explanatory manner,



"I'm rather particular about the exact time--have to be in this climate."



Even this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being

understood the Colonel politely said,



"Gentlemen, will you take something?"



Col. Sellers led the way to a saloon on Fourth street under the hotel,

and the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country.



"Not that," said the Colonel to the bar-keeper, who shoved along the

counter a bottle of apparently corn-whiskey, as if he had done it before

on the same order; "not that," with a wave of the hand.  "That Otard if

you please.  Yes.  Never take an inferior liquor, gentlemen, not in the

evening, in this climate.  There.  That's the stuff.  My respects!"



The hospitable gentleman, having disposed of his liquor, remarking that

it was not quite the thing--"when a man has his own cellar to go to, he

is apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors"--called for cigars.

But the brand offered did not suit him; he motioned the box away, and

asked for some particular Havana's, those in separate wrappers.



"I always smoke this sort, gentlemen; they are a little more expensive,

but you'll learn, in this climate, that you'd better not economize on

poor cigars"



Having imparted this valuable piece of information, the Colonel lighted

the fragrant cigar with satisfaction, and then carelessly put his fingers

into his right vest pocket.  That movement being without result, with a

shade of disappointment on his face, he felt in his left vest pocket.

Not finding anything there, he looked up with a serious and annoyed air,

anxiously slapped his right pantaloon's pocket, and then his left, and

exclaimed,



"By George, that's annoying.  By George, that's mortifying.  Never had

anything of that kind happen to me before.  I've left my pocket-book.

Hold!  Here's a bill, after all.  No, thunder, it's a receipt."



"Allow me," said Philip, seeing how seriously the Colonel was annoyed,

and taking out his purse.



The Colonel protested he couldn't think of it, and muttered something to

the barkeeper about "hanging it up," but the vender of exhilaration made

no sign, and Philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot; Col.

Sellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right "next time, next

time."



As soon as Beriah Sellers had bade his friends good night and seen them

depart, he did not retire apartments in the Planter's, but took his way

to his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city.









CHAPTER XIV.



The letter that Philip Sterling wrote to Ruth Bolton, on the evening of

setting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in her

own father's house in Philadelphia.  It was one of the pleasantest of the

many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is

territorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented

from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive

strip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic

ocean.  It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be

the deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to

its feasts.



It was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that made

Ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out-doors nor the in-

doors.  Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors

Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park,

four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples,

without having seen.  But Ruth confessed that she was tired of them, and

also of the Mint.  She was tired of other things.  She tried this morning

an air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly

metallic voice, and then seating herself by the open window, read

Philip's letter.  Was she thinking about Philip, as she gazed across the

fresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or of that world

which his entrance, into her tradition-bound life had been one of the

means of opening to her?  Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing,

as one might see by the expression of her face.  After a time she took

up a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance about as

interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but her face

was soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it that she did

not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.



"Ruth?"



"Well, mother," said the young student, looking up, with a shade of

impatience.



"I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans."



"Mother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled

me, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit."



"I know," said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, thee chafes

against all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do?  Why is thee so

discontented?"



"If I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead

level."



With a look half of pain and half of pity, her mother answered, "I am

sure thee is little interfered with; thee dresses as thee will, and goes

where thee pleases, to any church thee likes, and thee has music.  I had

a visit yesterday from the society's committee by way of discipline,

because we have a piano in the house, which is against the rules."



"I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the

piano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room when

it is played.  Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so they

can't discipline him.  I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was

whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined

to have what compensation he could get now."



"Thy ways greatly try me, Ruth, and all thy relations.  I desire thy

happiness first of all, but thee is starting out on a dangerous path.

Is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's

people?"



"I have not asked him," Ruth replied with a look that might imply that

she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own

mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers.



"And when thee has got the education thee wants, and lost all relish for

the society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors, what then?"



Ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and

not the slightest change of tone, said,



"Mother, I'm going to study medicine?"



Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.



"Thee, study medicine!  A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine!

Does thee think thee could stand it six months?  And the lectures,

and the dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?"



"Mother," said Ruth calmly, "I have thought it all over.  I know I can go

through the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all.  Does thee think I

lack nerve?  What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person

living?"



"But thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe

application.  And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?"



"I will practice it."



"Here?"



"Here."



"Where thee and thy family are known?"



"If I can get patients."



"I hope at least, Ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an office,"

said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in,

as she rose and left the room.



Ruth sat quite still for a tine, with face intent and flushed.  It was

out now.  She had begun her open battle.



The sight-seers returned in high spirits from the city.  Was there any

building in Greece to compare with Girard College, was there ever such a

magnificent pile of stone devised for the shelter of poor orphans?  Think

of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick!  Ruth asked the

enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum, with

its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it for the

accommodation of any body?  If they were orphans, would they like to be

brought up in a Grecian temple?



And then there was Broad street!  Wasn't it the broadest and the longest-

street in the world?  There certainly was no end to it, and even Ruth was

Philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end,

or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest.



But neither St. Girard, nor Broad street, neither wonders of the Mint nor

the glories of the Hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always

signing the Declaration; impressed the visitors so much as the splendors

of the Chestnut street windows, and the bargains on Eighth street.

The truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the

Yearly Meeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious

event was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more

worldly circles.



"Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, Ruth?" asked one of the girls.



"I have nothing to wear," replied that demure person.  "If thee wants to

see new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the

true form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting.  Any departure from

either color or shape would be instantly taken note of.  It has occupied

mother a long time, to find at the shops the exact shade for her new

bonnet.  Oh, thee must go by all means.  But thee won't see there a

sweeter woman than mother."



"And thee won't go?"



"Why should I?  I've been again and again.  If I go to Meeting at all I

like best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows

are all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves.

It's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's

the row of sleek-looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us

as we come out.  No, I don't feel at home there."



That evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire, as

they were quite apt to do at night.  It was always a time of confidences.



"Thee has another letter from young Sterling," said Eli Bolton.



"Yes.  Philip has gone to the far west."



"How far?"



"He doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything

beyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a

Wednesday Meeting."



"Humph.  It was time for him to do something.  Is he going to start a

daily newspaper among the Kick-a-poos?"



"Father, thee's unjust to Philip.  He's going into business."



"What sort of business can a young man go into without capital?"



"He doesn't say exactly what it is," said Ruth a little dubiously, "but

it's something about land and railroads, and thee knows, father, that

fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how, in a new country."



"I should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too.  But Philip

is honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make

his way.  But thee may as well take care of theeself, Ruth, and not go

dawdling along with a young man in his adventures, until thy own mind is

a little more settled what thee wants."



This excellent advice did not seem to impress Ruth greatly, for she was

looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her

grey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,



"I wish I could go west, or south, or somewhere.  What a box women are

put into, measured for it, and put in young; if we go anywhere it's in a

box, veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities.  Father, I should

like to break things and get loose!"



What a sweet-voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.



"Thee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes, child; women

always have; but what does thee want now that thee hasn't?"



"I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.  Why

should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl?

What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die?  What

one useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and

the children?  And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a

useless life?"



"Has thy mother led a useless life?"



"Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything,"

retorted the sharp little disputant.  "What's the good, father, of a

series of human beings who don't advance any?"



Friend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of

Meeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his

belief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle

of his, hatched in a Friend's dove-cote.  But he only said,



"Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career

thee wants?"



Ruth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't

understand her.  But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet

rebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself.  She also had a

history, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the

cage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had

passed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind,

which has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re-arrange the world.



Ruth replied to Philip's letter in due time and in the most cordial and

unsentimental manner.  Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she

did; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the

letter than about him.  He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when

he went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as

he stumbled along. The rather common-place and unformed hand-writing

seemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any

other woman.



Ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she

was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him.  She

should pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the Indians,

in St. Louis, would not take his scalp.



Philip looked rather dubious at this sentence, and wished that he had

written nothing about Indians.









CHAPTER XV.



Eli Bolton and his wife talked over Ruth's case, as they had often done

before, with no little anxiety.  Alone of all their children she was

impatient of the restraints and monotony of the Friends' Society, and

wholly indisposed to accept the "inner light" as a guide into a life of

acceptance and inaction.  When Margaret told her husband of Ruth's newest

project, he did not exhibit so much surprise as she hoped for.  In fact

he said that he did not see why a woman should not enter the medical

profession if she felt a call to it.



"But," said Margaret, "consider her total inexperience of the world, and

her frail health.  Can such a slight little body endure the ordeal of the

preparation for, or the strain of, the practice of the profession?"



"Did thee ever think, Margaret, whether, she can endure being thwarted in

an, object on which she has so set her heart, as she has on this?  Thee

has trained her thyself at home, in her enfeebled childhood, and thee

knows how strong her will is, and what she has been able to accomplish in

self-culture by the simple force of her determination.  She never will be

satisfied until she has tried her own strength."



"I wish," said Margaret, with an inconsequence that is not exclusively

feminine, "that she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by.

I think that would cure her of some of her notions.  I am not sure but if

she went away, to some distant school, into an entirely new life, her

thoughts would be diverted."



Eli Bolton almost laughed as he regarded his wife, with eyes that never

looked at her except fondly, and replied,



"Perhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also, before we were

married, and before thee became a member of Meeting.  I think Ruth comes

honestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the Friend's

dress."



Margaret could not say no to this, and while she paused, it was evident

that memory was busy with suggestions to shake her present opinions.



"Why not let Ruth try the study for a time," suggested Eli; "there is a

fair beginning of a Woman's Medical College in the city.  Quite likely

she will soon find that she needs first a more general culture, and fall,

in with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large

school."



There really seemed to be nothing else to be done, and Margaret consented

at length without approving.  And it was agreed that Ruth, in order to

spare her fatigue, should take lodgings with friends near the college and

make a trial in the pursuit of that science to which we all owe our

lives, and sometimes as by a miracle of escape.



That day Mr. Bolton brought home a stranger to dinner, Mr. Bigler of the

great firm of Pennybacker, Bigler & Small, railroad contractors.  He was

always bringing home somebody, who had a scheme; to build a road, or open

a mine, or plant a swamp with cane to grow paper-stock, or found a

hospital, or invest in a patent shad-bone separator, or start a college

somewhere on the frontier, contiguous to a land speculation.



The Bolton house was a sort of hotel for this kind of people.  They were

always coming.  Ruth had known them from childhood, and she used to say

that her father attracted them as naturally as a sugar hogshead does

flies.  Ruth had an idea that a large portion of the world lived by

getting the rest of the world into schemes.  Mr. Bolton never could say

"no" to any of them, not even, said Ruth again, to the society for

stamping oyster shells with scripture texts before they were sold at

retail.



Mr. Bigler's plan this time, about which he talked loudly, with his mouth

full, all dinner time, was the building of the Tunkhannock, Rattlesnake

and Youngwomans-town railroad, which would not only be a great highway to

the west, but would open to market inexhaustible coal-fields and untold

millions of lumber.  The plan of operations was very simple.



"We'll buy the lands," explained he, "on long time, backed by the notes

of good men; and then mortgage them for money enough to get the road well

on.  Then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock, and

sell their bonds for enough to complete the road, and partly stock it,

especially if we mortgage each section as we complete it.  We can then

sell the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of the road

through an improved country, and also sell the lands at a big advance,

on the strength of the road.  All we want," continued Mr. Bigler in his

frank manner, "is a few thousand dollars to start the surveys, and

arrange things in the legislature.  There is some parties will have to be

seen, who might make us trouble."



"It will take a good deal of money to start the enterprise," remarked Mr.

Bolton, who knew very well what "seeing" a Pennsylvania Legislature

meant, but was too polite to tell Mr. Bigler what he thought of him,

while he was his guest; "what security would one have for it?"



Mr. Bigler smiled a hard kind of smile, and said, "You'd be inside, Mr.

Bolton, and you'd have the first chance in the deal."



This was rather unintelligible to Ruth, who was nevertheless somewhat

amused by the study of a type of character she had seen before.

At length she interrupted the conversation by asking,



"You'd sell the stock, I suppose, Mr. Bigler, to anybody who was

attracted by the prospectus?"



"O, certainly, serve all alike," said Mr. Bigler, now noticing Ruth for

the first time, and a little puzzled by the serene, intelligent face that

was turned towards him.



"Well, what would become of the poor people who had been led to put their

little money into the speculation, when you got out of it and left it

half way?"



It would be no more true to say of Mr. Bigler that he was or could be

embarrassed, than to say that a brass counterfeit dollar-piece would

change color when refused; the question annoyed him a little, in Mr.

Bolton's presence.



"Why, yes, Miss, of course, in a great enterprise for the benefit of the

community there will little things occur, which, which--and, of course,

the poor ought to be looked to; I tell my wife, that the poor must be

looked to; if you can tell who are poor--there's so many impostors.  And

then, there's so many poor in the legislature to be looked after," said

the contractor with a sort of a chuckle, "isn't that so, Mr. Bolton?"



Eli Bolton replied that he never had much to do with the legislature.



"Yes," continued this public benefactor, "an uncommon poor lot this year,

uncommon.  Consequently an expensive lot.  The fact is, Mr. Bolton, that

the price is raised so high on United States Senator now, that it affects

the whole market; you can't get any public improvement through on

reasonable terms.  Simony is what I call it, Simony," repeated Mr.

Bigler, as if he had said a good thing.



Mr. Bigler went on and gave some very interesting details of the intimate

connection between railroads and politics, and thoroughly entertained

himself all dinner time, and as much disgusted Ruth, who asked no more

questions, and her father who replied in monosyllables:



"I wish," said Ruth to her father, after the guest had gone, "that you

wouldn't bring home any more such horrid men.  Do all men who wear big

diamond breast-pins, flourish their knives at table, and use bad grammar,

and cheat?"



"O, child, thee mustn't be too observing.  Mr. Bigler is one of the most

important men in the state; nobody has more influence at Harrisburg.

I don't like him any more than thee does, but I'd better lend him a

little money than to have his ill will."



"Father, I think thee'd better have his ill-will than his company.  Is it

true that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of

St. James the Less, and that he is, one of the vestrymen?"



"Yes.  He is not such a bad fellow.  One of the men in Third street asked

him the other day, whether his was a high church or a low church?  Bigler

said he didn't know; he'd been in it once, and he could touch the ceiling

in the side aisle with his hand."



"I think he's just horrid," was Ruth's final summary of him, after the

manner of the swift judgment of women, with no consideration of the

extenuating circumstances.  Mr. Bigler had no idea that he had not made a

good impression on the whole family; he certainly intended to be

agreeable.  Margaret agreed with her daughter, and though she never said

anything to such people, she was grateful to Ruth for sticking at least

one pin into him.



Such was the serenity of the Bolton household that a stranger in it would

never have suspected there was any opposition to Ruth's going to the

Medical School.  And she went quietly to take her residence in town, and

began her attendance of the lectures, as if it were the most natural

thing in the world.  She did not heed, if she heard, the busy and

wondering gossip of relations and acquaintances, gossip that has no less

currency among the Friends than elsewhere because it is whispered slyly

and creeps about in an undertone.



Ruth was absorbed, and for the first time in her life thoroughly happy;

happy in the freedom of her life, and in the keen enjoyment of the

investigation that broadened its field day by day.  She was in high

spirits when she came home to spend First Days; the house was full of her

gaiety and her merry laugh, and the children wished that Ruth would never

go away again.  But her mother noticed, with a little anxiety, the

sometimes flushed face, and the sign of an eager spirit in the kindling

eyes, and, as well, the serious air of determination and endurance in her

face at unguarded moments.



The college was a small one and it sustained itself not without

difficulty in this city, which is so conservative, and is yet the origin

of so many radical movements.  There were not more than a dozen

attendants on the lectures all together, so that the enterprise had the

air of an experiment, and the fascination of pioneering for those engaged

in it.  There was one woman physician driving about town in her carriage,

attacking the most violent diseases in all quarters with persistent

courage, like a modern Bellona in her war chariot, who was popularly

supposed to gather in fees to the amount ten to twenty thousand dollars a

year.  Perhaps some of these students looked forward to the near day when

they would support such a practice and a husband besides, but it is

unknown that any of them ever went further than practice in hospitals and

in their own nurseries, and it is feared that some of them were quite as

ready as their sisters, in emergencies, to "call a man."



If Ruth had any exaggerated expectations of a professional life, she kept

them to herself, and was known to her fellows of the class simply as a

cheerful, sincere student, eager in her investigations, and never

impatient at anything, except an insinuation that women had not as much

mental capacity for science as men.



"They really say," said one young Quaker sprig to another youth of his

age, "that Ruth Bolton is really going to be a saw-bones, attends

lectures, cuts up bodies, and all that.  She's cool enough for a surgeon,

anyway."  He spoke feelingly, for he had very likely been weighed in

Ruth's calm eyes sometime, and thoroughly scared by the little laugh that

accompanied a puzzling reply to one of his conversational nothings.  Such

young gentlemen, at this time, did not come very distinctly into Ruth's

horizon, except as amusing circumstances.



About the details of her student life, Ruth said very little to her

friends, but they had reason to know, afterwards, that it required all

her nerve and the almost complete exhaustion of her physical strength,

to carry her through.  She began her anatomical practice upon detached

portions of the human frame, which were brought into the demonstrating

room--dissecting the eye, the ear, and a small tangle of muscles and

nerves--an occupation which had not much more savor of death in it than

the analysis of a portion of a plant out of which the life went when it

was plucked up by the roots.  Custom inures the most sensitive persons to

that which is at first most repellant; and in the late war we saw the

most delicate women, who could not at home endure the sight of blood,

become so used to scenes of carnage, that they walked the hospitals and

the margins of battle-fields, amid the poor remnants of torn humanity,

with as perfect self-possession as if they were strolling in a flower

garden.



It happened that Ruth was one evening deep in a line of investigation

which she could not finish or understand without demonstration, and so

eager was she in it, that it seemed as if she could not wait till the

next day.  She, therefore, persuaded a fellow student, who was reading

that evening with her, to go down to the dissecting room of the college,

and ascertain what they wanted to know by an hour's work there.  Perhaps,

also, Ruth wanted to test her own nerve, and to see whether the power of

association was stronger in her mind than her own will.



The janitor of the shabby and comfortless old building admitted the

girls, not without suspicion, and gave them lighted candles, which they

would need, without other remark than "there's a new one, Miss," as the

girls went up the broad stairs.



They climbed to the third story, and paused before a door, which they

unlocked, and which admitted them into a long apartment, with a row of

windows on one side and one at the end.  The room was without light, save

from the stars and the candles the girls carried, which revealed to them

dimly two long and several small tables, a few benches and chairs, a

couple of skeletons hanging on the wall, a sink, and cloth-covered heaps

of something upon the tables here and there.



The windows were open, and the cool night wind came in strong enough to

flutter a white covering now and then, and to shake the loose casements.

But all the sweet odors of the night could not take from the room a faint

suggestion of mortality.



The young ladies paused a moment.  The room itself was familiar enough,

but night makes almost any chamber eerie, and especially such a room of

detention as this where the mortal parts of the unburied might--almost be

supposed to be, visited, on the sighing night winds, by the wandering

spirits of their late tenants.



Opposite and at some distance across the roofs of lower buildings, the

girls saw a tall edifice, the long upper story of which seemed to be a

dancing hall.  The windows of that were also open, and through them they

heard the scream of the jiggered and tortured violin, and the pump, pump

of the oboe, and saw the moving shapes of men and women in quick

transition, and heard the prompter's drawl.



"I wonder," said Ruth, "what the girls dancing there would think if they

saw us, or knew that there was such a room as this so near them."



She did not speak very loud, and, perhaps unconsciously, the girls drew

near to each other as they approached the long table in the centre of the

room.  A straight object lay upon it, covered with a sheet.  This was

doubtless "the new one" of which the janitor spoke.  Ruth advanced, and

with a not very steady hand lifted the white covering from the upper part

of the figure and turned it down.  Both the girls started.  It was a

negro.  The black face seemed to defy the pallor of death, and asserted

an ugly life-likeness that was frightful.



Ruth was as pale as the white sheet, and her comrade whispered, "Come

away, Ruth, it is awful."



Perhaps it was the wavering light of the candles, perhaps it was only the

agony from a death of pain, but the repulsive black face seemed to wear a

scowl that said, "Haven't you yet done with the outcast, persecuted black

man, but you must now haul him from his grave, and send even your women

to dismember his body?"



Who is this dead man, one of thousands who died yesterday, and will be

dust anon, to protest that science shall not turn his worthless carcass

to some account?



Ruth could have had no such thought, for with a pity in her sweet face,

that for the moment overcame fear and disgust, she reverently replaced

the covering, and went away to her own table, as her companion did to

hers.  And there for an hour they worked at their several problems,

without speaking, but not without an awe of the presence there, "the new

one," and not without an awful sense of life itself, as they heard the

pulsations of the music and the light laughter from the dancing-hall.



When, at length, they went away, and locked the dreadful room behind

them, and came out into the street, where people were passing, they, for

the first time, realized, in the relief they felt, what a nervous strain

they had been under.









CHAPTER XVI.



While Ruth was thus absorbed in her new occupation, and the spring was

wearing away, Philip and his friends were still detained at the Southern

Hotel.  The great contractors had concluded their business with the state

and railroad officials and with the lesser contractors, and departed for

the East.  But the serious illness of one of the engineers kept Philip

and Henry in the city and occupied in alternate watchings.



Philip wrote to Ruth of the new acquaintance they had made, Col. Sellers,

an enthusiastic and hospitable gentleman, very much interested in the

development of the country, and in their success.  They had not had an

opportunity to visit at his place "up in the country" yet, but the

Colonel often dined with them, and in confidence, confided to them his

projects, and seemed to take a great liking to them, especially to his

friend Harry.  It was true that he never seemed to have ready money,

but he was engaged in very large operations.



The correspondence was not very brisk between these two young persons,

so differently occupied; for though Philip wrote long letters, he got

brief ones in reply, full of sharp little observations however, such as

one concerning Col. Sellers, namely, that such men dined at their house

every week.



Ruth's proposed occupation astonished Philip immensely, but while he

argued it and discussed it, he did not dare hint to her his fear that it

would interfere with his most cherished plans.  He too sincerely

respected Ruth's judgment to make any protest, however, and he would have

defended her course against the world.



This enforced waiting at St. Louis was very irksome to Philip.  His money

was running away, for one thing, and he longed to get into the field,

and see for himself what chance there was for a fortune or even an

occupation.  The contractors had given the young men leave to join the

engineer corps as soon as they could, but otherwise had made no provision

for them, and in fact had left them with only the most indefinite

expectations of something large in the future.



Harry was entirely happy; in his circumstances.  He very soon knew

everybody, from the governor of the state down to the waiters at the

hotel.  He had the Wall street slang at his tongue's end; he always

talked like a capitalist, and entered with enthusiasm into all the land

and railway schemes with which the air was thick.



Col. Sellers and Harry talked together by the hour and by the day.  Harry

informed his new friend that he was going out with the engineer corps of

the Salt Lick Pacific Extension, but that wasn't his real business.



"I'm to have, with another party," said Harry, "a big contract in the

road, as soon as it is let; and, meantime, I'm with the engineers to spy

out the best land and the depot sites."



"It's everything," suggested' the Colonel, "in knowing where to invest.

I've known people throwaway their money because they  were too

consequential to take Sellers' advice.  Others, again, have made their

pile on taking it.  I've looked over the ground; I've been studying it

for twenty years.  You can't put your finger on a spot in the map of

Missouri that I don't know as if I'd made it.  When you want to place

anything," continued the Colonel, confidently, "just let Beriah Sellers

know.  That's all."



"Oh, I haven't got much in ready money I can lay my hands on now, but if

a fellow could do anything with fifteen or twenty thousand dollars,

as a beginning, I shall draw for that when I see the right opening."



"Well, that's something, that's something, fifteen or twenty thousand

dollars, say twenty--as an advance," said the Colonel reflectively, as if

turning over his mind for a project that could be entered on with such a

trifling sum.



"I'll tell you what it is--but only to you Mr. Brierly, only to you,

mind; I've got a little project that I've been keeping.  It looks small,

looks small on paper, but it's got a big future.  What should you say,

sir, to a city, built up like the rod of Aladdin had touched it, built up

in two years, where now you wouldn't expect it any more than you'd expect

a light-house on the top of Pilot Knob? and you could own the land!  It

can be done, sir.  It can be done!"



The Colonel hitched up his chair close to Harry, laid his hand on his

knee, and, first looking about him, said in a low voice, "The Salt Lick

Pacific Extension is going to run through Stone's Landing!  The Almighty

never laid out a cleaner piece of level prairie for a city; and it's the

natural center of all that region of hemp and tobacco."



"What makes you think the road will go there?  It's twenty miles, on the

map, off the straight line of the road?"



"You can't tell what is the straight line till the engineers have been

over it.  Between us, I have talked with Jeff Thompson, the division

engineer.  He understands the wants of Stone's Landing, and the claims of

the inhabitants--who are to be there.  Jeff says that a railroad is for-

the accommodation of the people and not for the benefit of gophers; and

if, he don't run this to Stone's Landing he'll be damned!  You ought to

know Jeff; he's one of the most enthusiastic engineers in this western

country, and one of the best fellows that ever looked through the bottom

of a glass."



The recommendation was not undeserved.  There was nothing that Jeff

wouldn't do, to accommodate a friend, from sharing his last dollar with

him, to winging him in a duel.  When he understood from Col. Sellers.

how the land lay at Stone's Landing, he cordially shook hands with that

gentleman, asked him to drink, and fairly roared out, "Why, God bless my

soul, Colonel, a word from one Virginia gentleman to another is 'nuff

ced.'  There's Stone's Landing been waiting for a railroad more than four

thousand years, and damme if she shan't have it."



Philip had not so much faith as Harry in Stone's Landing, when the latter

opened the project to him, but Harry talked about it as if he already

owned that incipient city.



Harry thoroughly believed in all his projects and inventions, and lived

day by day in their golden atmosphere.  Everybody liked the young fellow,

for how could they help liking one of such engaging manners and large

fortune?  The waiters at the hotel would do more for him than for any

other guest, and he made a great many acquaintances among the people of

St. Louis, who liked his sensible and liberal views about the development

of the western country, and about St. Louis.  He said it ought to be the

national capital.  Harry made partial arrangements with several of the

merchants for furnishing supplies for his contract on the Salt Lick

Pacific Extension; consulted the maps with the engineers, and went over

the profiles with the contractors, figuring out estimates for bids.

He was exceedingly busy with those things when he was not at the bedside

of his sick acquaintance, or arranging the details of his speculation

with Col. Sellers.



Meantime the days went along and the weeks, and the money in Harry's

pocket got lower and lower.  He was just as liberal with what he had as

before, indeed it was his nature to be free with his money or with that

of others, and he could lend or spend a dollar with an air that made it

seem like ten.  At length, at the end of one week, when his hotel bill

was presented, Harry found not a cent in his pocket to meet it.  He

carelessly remarked to the landlord that he was not that day in funds,

but he would draw on New York, and he sat down and wrote to the

contractors in that city a glowing letter about the prospects of the

road, and asked them to advance a hundred or two, until he got at work.

No reply came.  He wrote again, in an unoffended business like tone,

suggesting that he had better draw at three days.  A short answer came to

this, simply saying that money was very tight in Wall street just then,

and that he had better join the engineer corps as soon as he could.



But the bill had to be paid, and Harry took it to Philip, and asked him

if he thought he hadn't better draw on his uncle.  Philip had not much

faith in Harry's power of "drawing," and told him that he would pay the

bill himself.  Whereupon Harry dismissed the matter then and thereafter

from his thoughts, and, like a light-hearted good fellow as he was, gave

himself no more trouble about his board-bills.  Philip paid them, swollen

as they were with a monstrous list of extras; but he seriously counted

the diminishing bulk of his own hoard, which was all the money he had in

the world.  Had he not tacitly agreed to share with Harry to the last in

this adventure, and would not the generous fellow divide; with him if he,

Philip, were in want and Harry had anything?



The fever at length got tired of tormenting the stout young engineer, who

lay sick at the hotel, and left him, very thin, a little sallow but an

"acclimated" man.  Everybody said he was "acclimated" now, and said it

cheerfully.  What it is to be acclimated to western fevers no two persons

exactly agree.



Some say it is a sort of vaccination that renders death by some malignant

type of fever less probable.  Some regard it as a sort of initiation,

like that into the Odd Fellows, which renders one liable to his regular

dues thereafter.  Others consider it merely the acquisition of a habit of

taking every morning before breakfast a dose of bitters, composed of

whiskey and assafoetida, out of the acclimation jug.



Jeff Thompson afterwards told Philip that he once asked Senator Atchison,

then acting Vice-President: of the United States, about the possibility

of acclimation; he thought the opinion of the second officer of our great

government would be, valuable on this point.  They were sitting together

on a bench before a country tavern, in the free converse permitted by our

democratic habits.



"I suppose, Senator, that you have become acclimated to this country?"



"Well," said the Vice-President, crossing his legs, pulling his wide-

awake down over his forehead, causing a passing chicken to hop quickly

one side by the accuracy of his aim, and speaking with senatorial

deliberation, "I think I have.  I've been here twenty-five years, and

dash, dash my dash to dash, if I haven't entertained twenty-five separate

and distinct earthquakes, one a year.  The niggro is the only person who

can stand the fever and ague of this region."



The convalescence of the engineer was the signal for breaking up quarters

at St. Louis, and the young fortune-hunters started up the river in good

spirits.  It was only the second time either of them had been upon a

Mississippi steamboat, and nearly everything they saw had the charm of

novelty.  Col. Sellers was at the landing to bid thorn good-bye.



"I shall send you up that basket of champagne by the next boat; no, no;

no thanks; you'll find it not bad in camp," he cried out as the plank was

hauled in.  "My respects to Thompson.  Tell him to sight for Stone's.

Let me know, Mr. Brierly, when you are ready to locate; I'll come over

from Hawkeye.  Goodbye."



And the last the young fellows saw of the Colonel, he was waving his hat,

and beaming prosperity and good luck.



The voyage was delightful, and was not long enough to become monotonous.

The travelers scarcely had time indeed to get accustomed to the splendors

of the great saloon where the tables were spread for meals, a marvel of

paint and gilding, its ceiling hung with fancifully cut tissue-paper of

many colors, festooned and arranged in endless patterns.  The whole was

more beautiful than a barber's shop.  The printed bill of fare at dinner

was longer and more varied, the proprietors justly boasted, than that of

any hotel in New York.  It must have been the work of an author of talent

and imagination, and it surely was not his fault if the dinner itself was

to a certain extent a delusion, and if the guests got something that

tasted pretty much the same whatever dish they ordered; nor was it his

fault if a general flavor of rose in all the dessert dishes suggested

that they hid passed through the barber's saloon on their way from the

kitchen.



The travelers landed at a little settlement on the left bank, and at once

took horses for the camp in the interior, carrying their clothes and

blankets strapped behind the saddles.  Harry was dressed as we have seen

him once before, and his long and shining boots attracted not a little

the attention of the few persons they met on the road, and especially of

the bright faced wenches who lightly stepped along the highway,

picturesque in their colored kerchiefs, carrying light baskets, or riding

upon mules and balancing before them a heavier load.



Harry sang fragments of operas and talked abort their fortune.  Philip

even was excited by the sense of freedom and adventure, and the beauty of

the landscape.  The prairie, with its new grass and unending acres of

brilliant flowers--chiefly the innumerable varieties of phlox-bore the

look of years of cultivation, and the occasional open groves of white

oaks gave it a park-like appearance.  It was hardly unreasonable to

expect to see at any moment, the gables and square windows of an

Elizabethan mansion in one of the well kept groves.



Towards sunset of the third day, when the young gentlemen thought they

ought to be near the town of Magnolia, near which they had been directed

to find the engineers' camp, they descried a log house and drew up before

it to enquire the way.  Half the building was store, and half was

dwelling house.  At the door of the latter stood a regress with a bright

turban on her head, to whom Philip called,



"Can you tell me, auntie, how far it is to the town of Magnolia?"



"Why, bress you chile," laughed the woman, "you's dere now."



It was true.  This log horse was the compactly built town, and all

creation was its suburbs.  The engineers' camp was only two or three

miles distant.



"You's boun' to find it," directed auntie, "if you don't keah nuffin

'bout de road, and go fo' de sun-down."



A brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of the

camp, just as the stars came out.  It lay in a little hollow, where a

small stream ran through a sparse grove of young white oaks.  A half

dozen tents were pitched under the trees, horses and oxen were corraled

at a little distance, and a group of men sat on camp stools or lay on

blankets about a bright fire.  The twang of a banjo became audible as

they drew nearer, and they saw a couple of negroes, from some neighboring

plantation, "breaking down" a juba in approved style, amid the "hi, hi's"

of the spectators.



Mr. Jeff Thompson, for it was the camp of this redoubtable engineer, gave

the travelers a hearty welcome, offered them ground room in his own tent,

ordered supper, and set out a small jug, a drop from which he declared

necessary on account of the chill of the evening.



"I never saw an Eastern man," said Jeff, "who knew how to drink from a

jug with one hand.  It's as easy as lying.  So."  He grasped the handle

with the right hand, threw the jug back upon his arm, and applied his

lips to the nozzle.  It was an act as graceful as it was simple.

"Besides," said Mr. Thompson, setting it down, "it puts every man on his

honor as to quantity."



Early to turn in was the rule of the camp, and by nine o'clock everybody

was under his blanket, except Jeff himself, who worked awhile at his

table over his field-book, and then arose, stepped outside the tent door

and sang, in a strong and not unmelodious tenor, the Star Spangled Banner

from beginning to end.  It proved to be his nightly practice to let off

the unexpended seam of his conversational powers, in the words of this

stirring song.



It was a long time before Philip got to sleep.  He saw the fire light,

he saw the clear stars through the tree-tops, he heard the gurgle of the

stream, the stamp of the horses, the occasional barking of the dog which

followed the cook's wagon, the hooting of an owl; and when these failed

he saw Jeff, standing on a battlement, mid the rocket's red glare, and

heard him sing, "Oh, say, can you see?", It was the first time he had

ever slept on the ground.









CHAPTER XVII.



         ----"We have view'd it,

          And measur'd it within all, by the scale

          The richest tract of land, love, in the kingdom!

          There will be made seventeen or eighteeen millions,

          Or more, as't may be handled!

                              The Devil is an Ass.



Nobody dressed more like an engineer than Mr. Henry Brierly.  The

completeness of his appointments was the envy of the corps, and the gay

fellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants, axemen, teamsters

and cooks.



"I reckon you didn't git them boots no wher's this side o' Sent Louis?"

queried the tall Missouri youth who acted as commissariy's assistant.



"No, New York."



"Yas, I've heern o' New York," continued the butternut lad, attentively

studying each item of Harry's dress, and endeavoring to cover his design

with interesting conversation.  "'N there's Massachusetts.",



"It's not far off."



"I've heern Massachusetts was a-----of a place.  Les, see, what state's

Massachusetts in?"



"Massachusetts," kindly replied Harry, "is in the state of Boston."



"Abolish'n wan't it?  They must a cost right smart," referring to the

boots.



Harry shouldered his rod and went to the field, tramped over the prairie

by day, and figured up results at night, with the utmost cheerfulness and

industry, and plotted the line on the profile paper, without, however,

the least idea of engineering practical or theoretical.  Perhaps there

was not a great deal of scientific knowledge in the entire corps, nor was

very much needed.  They were making, what is called a preliminary survey,

and the chief object of a preliminary survey was to get up an excitement

about the road, to interest every town in that part of the state in it,

under the belief that the road would run through it, and to get the aid

of every planter upon the prospect that a station would be on his land.



Mr. Jeff Thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found for

this work.  He did not bother himself much about details or

practicabilities of location, but ran merrily along, sighting from the

top of one divide to the top of another, and striking "plumb" every town

site and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route.  In

his own language he "just went booming."



This course gave Harry an opportunity, as he said, to learn the practical

details of engineering, and it gave Philip a chance to see the country,

and to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered.  Both he

and Harry got the "refusal" of more than one plantation as they went

along, and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents, upon the

beauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in value as

soon as the road was finally located.  It seemed strange to them that

capitalists did not flock out there and secure this land.



They had not been in the field over two weeks when Harry wrote to his

friend Col. Sellers that he'd better be on the move, for the line was

certain to go to Stone's Landing.  Any one who looked at the line on the

map, as it was laid down from day to day, would have been uncertain which

way it was going; but Jeff had declared that in his judgment the only

practicable route from the point they then stood on was to follow the

divide to Stone's Landing, and it was generally understood that that town

would be the next one hit.



"We'll make it, boys," said the chief, "if we have to go in a balloon."



And make it they did In less than a week, this indomitable engineer had

carried his moving caravan over slues and branches, across bottoms and

along divides, and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city of

Stone's Landing.



"Well, I'll be dashed," was heard the cheery voice of Mr. Thompson, as he

stepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning.  "If this don't

get me.  I say, yon, Grayson, get out your sighting iron and see if you

can find old Sellers' town.  Blame me if we wouldn't have run plumb by it

if twilight had held on a little longer.  Oh!  Sterling, Brierly, get up

and see the city.  There's a steamboat just coming round the bend."  And

Jeff roared with laughter.  "The mayor'll be round here to breakfast."



The fellows turned out of the tents, rubbing their eyes, and stared about

them.  They were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of a

crooked, sluggish stream, that was some five rods wide in the present

good stage of water.  Before them were a dozen log cabins, with stick and

mud chimneys, irregularly disposed on either side of a not very well

defined road, which did not seem to know its own mind exactly, and, after

straggling through the town, wandered off over the rolling prairie in an

uncertain way, as if it had started for nowhere and was quite likely to

reach its destination.  Just as it left the town, however, it was cheered

and assisted by a guide-board, upon which was the legend "10 Mils to

Hawkeye."



The road had never been made except by the travel over it, and at this

season--the rainy June--it was a way of ruts cut in the black soil, and

of fathomless mud-holes.  In the principal street of the city, it had

received more attention; for hogs; great and small, rooted about in it

and wallowed in it, turning the street into a liquid quagmire which could

only be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there.



About the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this mart of

trade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the rude platform in

front of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted thereon were places of refuge

for all the loafers of the place.  Down by the stream was a dilapidated

building which served for a hemp warehouse, and a shaky wharf extended

out from it, into the water.  In fact a flat-boat was there moored by it,

it's setting poles lying across the gunwales.  Above the town the stream

was crossed by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports of which leaned all

ways in the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here and there in the

flooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a walk an offense

not necessary to be prohibited by law.



"This, gentlemen," said Jeff, "is Columbus River, alias Goose Run.  If it

was widened, and deepened, and straightened, and  made, long enough, it

would be one of the finest rivers in the western country."



As the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream, the thin

stratum of mist, or malaria, rose also and dispersed, but the light was

not able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently

fathomless depth.  Venerable mud-turtles crawled up and roosted upon the

old logs in the stream, their backs glistening in the sun, the first

inhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the day.



It was not long, however, before smoke began to issue from the city

chimnies; and before the engineers, had finished their breakfast they

were the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men,

who lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest,

their hands in their pockets every one.



"Good morning; gentlemen," called out the chief engineer, from the table.



"Good mawning," drawled out the spokesman of the party.  "I allow thish-

yers the railroad, I heern it was a-comin'."



"Yes, this is the railroad; all but the rails and the ironhorse."



"I reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak timber

over, thar," replied the first speaker, who appeared to be a man of

property and willing to strike up a trade.



"You'll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails, sir,"

said Jeff; "here's Mr. Brierly, I've no doubt would like to buy your

rails when the time comes."



"O," said the man, "I thought maybe you'd fetch the whole bilin along

with you.  But if you want rails, I've got em, haint I Eph."



"Heaps," said Eph, without taking his eyes off the group at the table.



"Well," said Mr. Thompson, rising from his seat and moving towards his

tent, "the railroad has come to Stone's Landing, sure; I move we take a

drink on it all round."



The proposal met with universal favor.  Jeff gave prosperity to Stone's

Landing and navigation to Goose Run, and the toast was washed down with

gusto, in the simple fluid of corn; and with the return compliment that a

rail road was a good thing, and that Jeff Thompson was no slouch.



About ten o'clock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow approach

to the camp over the prairie.  As it drew near, the wagon was seen to

contain a portly gentleman, who hitched impatiently forward on his seat,

shook the reins and gently touched up his horse, in the vain attempt to

communicate his own energy to that dull beast, and looked eagerly at the

tents.  When the conveyance at length drew up to Mr. Thompson's door,

the gentleman descended with great deliberation, straightened himself up,

rubbed his hands, and beaming satisfaction from every part of his radiant

frame, advanced to the group that was gathered to welcome him, and which

had saluted him by name as soon as he came within hearing.



"Welcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome.  I am proud to see you here

Mr. Thompson.  You are, looking well Mr. Sterling.  This is the country,

sir.  Right glad to see you Mr. Brierly.  You got that basket of

champagne?  No?  Those blasted river thieves!  I'll never send anything

more by 'em.  The best brand, Roederer.  The last I had in my cellar,

from a lot sent me by Sir George Gore--took him out on a buffalo hunt,

when he visited our, country.  Is always sending me some trifle.  You

haven't looked about any yet, gentlemen?  It's in the rough yet, in the

rough.  Those buildings will all have to come down.  That's the place for

the public square, Court House, hotels, churches, jail--all that sort of

thing.  About where we stand, the deepo.  How does that strike your

engineering eye, Mr. Thompson?  Down yonder the business streets, running

to the wharves.  The University up there, on rising ground, sightly

place, see the river for miles.  That's Columbus river, only forty-nine

miles to the Missouri.  You see what it is, placid, steady, no current to

interfere with navigation, wants widening in places and dredging, dredge

out the harbor and raise a levee in front of the town; made by nature on

purpose for a mart.  Look at all this country, not another building

within ten miles, no other navigable stream, lay of the land points right

here; hemp, tobacco, corn, must come here.  The railroad will do it,

Napoleon won't know itself in a year."



"Don't now evidently," said Philip aside to Harry.  "Have you breakfasted

Colonel?"



"Hastily.  Cup of coffee.  Can't trust any coffee I don't import myself.

But I put up a basket of provisions,--wife would put in a few delicacies,

women always will, and a half dozen of that Burgundy, I was telling you

of Mr. Briefly.  By the way, you never got to dine with me."  And the

Colonel strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for the

basket.



Apparently it was not there.  For the Colonel raised up the flap, looked

in front and behind, and then exclaimed,



"Confound it.  That comes of not doing a thing yourself.  I trusted to

the women folks to set that basket in the wagon, and it ain't there."



The camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the Colonel,

broiled chicken, eggs, corn-bread, and coffee, to which he did ample

justice, and topped  off with a drop of Old Bourbon, from Mr. Thompson's

private store, a brand which he said he knew well, he should think it

came from his own sideboard.



While the engineer corps went to the field, to run back a couple of miles

and ascertain, approximately, if a road could ever get down to the

Landing, and to sight ahead across the Run, and see if it could ever get

out again, Col. Sellers and Harry sat down and began to roughly map out

the city of Napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper.



"I've got the refusal of a mile square here," said the Colonel, "in our

names, for a year, with a quarter interest reserved for the four owners."



They laid out the town liberally, not lacking room, leaving space for the

railroad to come in, and for the river as it was to be when improved.



The engineers reported that the railroad could come in, by taking a

little sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge, but the grades

would be steep.  Col. Sellers said he didn't care so much about the

grades, if the road could only be made to reach the elevators on the

river.  The next day Mr. Thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a

mile or two, so that the Colonel and Harry were enabled to show on their

map how nobly that would accommodate the city.  Jeff took a little

writing from the Colonel and Harry for a prospective share but Philip

declined to join in, saying that he had no money, and didn't want to make

engagements he couldn't fulfill.



The next morning the camp moved on, followed till it was out of sight by

the listless eyes of the group in front of the store, one of whom

remarked that, "he'd be doggoned if he ever expected to see that railroad

any mo'."



Harry went with the Colonel to Hawkeye to complete their arrangements, a

part of which was the preparation of a petition to congress for the

improvement of the navigation of Columbus River.









CHAPTER XVIII.



Eight years have passed since the death of Mr. Hawkins.  Eight years are

not many in the life of a nation or the history of a state, but they

maybe years of destiny that shall fix the current of the century

following.  Such years were those that followed the little scrimmage on

Lexington Common.  Such years were those that followed the double-shotted

demand for the surrender of Fort Sumter.  History is never done with

inquiring of these years, and summoning witnesses about them, and trying

to understand their significance.



The eight years in America from 1860 to 1868 uprooted institutions that

were centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the

social life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the

entire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of

two or three generations.



As we are accustomed to interpret the economy of providence, the life of

the individual is as nothing to that of the nation or the race; but who

can say, in the broader view and the more intelligent weight of values,

that the life of one man is not more than that of a nationality, and that

there is not a tribunal where the tragedy of one human soul shall not

seem more significant than the overturning of any human institution

whatever?



When one thinks of the tremendous forces of the upper and the nether

world which play for the mastery of the soul of a woman during the few

years in which she passes from plastic girlhood to the ripe maturity of

womanhood, he may well stand in awe before the momentous drama.



What capacities she has of purity, tenderness, goodness; what capacities

of vileness, bitterness and evil.  Nature must needs be lavish with the

mother and creator of men, and centre in her all the possibilities of

life.  And a few critical years can decide whether her life is to be full

of sweetness and light, whether she is to be the vestal of a holy temple,

or whether she will be the fallen priestess of a desecrated shrine.

There are women, it is true, who seem to be capable neither of rising

much nor of falling much, and whom a conventional life saves from any

special development of character.



But Laura was not one of them.  She had the fatal gift of beauty, and

that more fatal gift which does not always accompany mere beauty, the

power of fascination, a power that may, indeed, exist without beauty.

She had will, and pride and courage and ambition, and she was left to be

very much her own guide at the age when romance comes to the aid of

passion, and when the awakening powers of her vigorous mind had little

object on which to discipline themselves.



The tremendous conflict that was fought in this girl's soul none of those

about her knew, and very few knew that her life had in it anything

unusual or romantic or strange.



Those were troublous days in Hawkeye as well as in most other Missouri

towns, days of confusion, when between Unionist and Confederate

occupations, sudden maraudings and bush-whackings and raids, individuals

escaped observation or comment in actions that would have filled the town

with scandal in quiet times.



Fortunately we only need to deal with Laura's life at this period

historically, and look back upon such portions of it as will serve to

reveal the woman as she was at the time of the arrival of Mr. Harry

Brierly in Hawkeye.



The Hawkins family were settled there, and had a hard enough struggle

with poverty and the necessity of keeping up appearances in accord with

their own family pride and the large expectations they secretly cherished

of a fortune in the Knobs of East Tennessee.  How pinched they were

perhaps no one knew but Clay, to whom they looked for almost their whole

support.  Washington had been in Hawkeye off and on, attracted away

occasionally by some tremendous speculation, from which he invariably

returned to Gen. Boswell's office as poor as he went.  He was the

inventor of no one knew how many useless contrivances, which were not

worth patenting, and his years had been passed in dreaming and planning

to no purpose; until he was now a man of about thirty, without a

profession or a permanent occupation, a tall, brown-haired, dreamy person

of the best intentions and the frailest resolution.  Probably however

the, eight years had been happier to him than to any others in his

circle, for the time had been mostly spent in a blissful dream of the

coming of enormous wealth.



He went out with a company from Hawkeye to the war, and was not wanting

in courage, but be would have been a better soldier if he had been less

engaged in contrivances for circumventing the enemy by strategy unknown

to the books.



It happened to him to be captured in one of his self-appointed

expeditions, but the federal colonel released him, after a short

examination, satisfied that he could most injure the confederate forces

opposed to the Unionists by returning him to his regiment.  Col. Sellers

was of course a prominent man during the war.  He was captain of the home

guards in Hawkeye, and he never left home except upon one occasion, when

on the strength of a rumor, he executed a flank movement and fortified

Stone's Landing, a place which no one unacquainted with the country would

be likely to find.



"Gad," said the Colonel afterwards, "the Landing is the key to upper

Missouri, and it is the only place the enemy never captured.  If other

places had been defended as well as that was, the result would have been

different, sir."



The Colonel had his own theories about war as he had in other things.

If everybody had stayed at home as he did, he said, the South never would

have been conquered.  For what would there have been to conquer?  Mr.

Jeff Davis was constantly writing him to take command of a corps in the

confederate army, but Col. Sellers said, no, his duty was at home.  And

he was by no means idle.  He was the inventor of the famous air torpedo,

which came very near destroying the Union armies in Missouri, and the

city of St. Louis itself.



His plan was to fill a torpedo with Greek fire and poisonous and deadly

missiles, attach it to a balloon, and then let it sail away over the

hostile camp and explode at the right moment, when the time-fuse burned

out.  He intended to use this invention in the capture of St. Louis,

exploding his torpedoes over the city, and raining destruction upon it

until the army of occupation would gladly capitulate.  He was unable to

procure the Greek fire, but he constructed a vicious torpedo which would

have answered the purpose, but the first one prematurely exploded in his

wood-house, blowing it clean away, and setting fire to his house.  The

neighbors helped him put out the conflagration, but they discouraged any

more experiments of that sort.



The patriotic old gentleman, however, planted so much powder and so many

explosive contrivances in the roads leading into Hawkeye, and then forgot

the exact spots of danger, that people were afraid to travel the

highways, and used to come to town across the fields, The Colonel's motto

was, "Millions for defence but not one cent for tribute."



When Laura came to Hawkeye she might have forgotten the annoyances of the

gossips of Murpheysburg and have out lived the bitterness that was

growing in her heart, if she had been thrown less upon herself, or if the

surroundings of her life had been more congenial and helpful.  But she

had little society, less and less as she grew older that was congenial to

her, and her mind preyed upon itself; and the mystery of her birth at

once chagrined her and raised in her the most extravagant expectations.

She was proud and she felt the sting of poverty.  She could not but be

conscious of her beauty also, and she was vain of that, and came to take

a sort of delight in the exercise of her fascinations upon the rather

loutish young men who came in her way and whom she despised.



There was another world opened to her--a world of books.  But it was not

the best world of that sort, for the small libraries she had access to in

Hawkeye were decidedly miscellaneous, and largely made up of romances and

fictions which fed her imagination with the most exaggerated notions of

life, and showed her men and women in a very false sort of heroism.  From

these stories she learned what a woman of keen intellect and some culture

joined to beauty and fascination of manner, might expect to accomplish in

society as she read of it; and along with these ideas she imbibed other

very crude ones in regard to the emancipation of woman.



There were also other books-histories, biographies of distinguished

people, travels in far lands, poems, especially those of Byron, Scott and

Shelley and Moore, which she eagerly absorbed, and appropriated therefrom

what was to her liking.  Nobody in Hawkeye had read so much or, after a

fashion, studied so diligently as Laura.  She passed for an accomplished

girl, and no doubt thought herself one, as she was, judged by any

standard near her.



During the war there came to Hawkeye a confederate officer, Col. Selby,

who was stationed there for a time, in command of that district.  He was

a handsome, soldierly man of thirty years, a graduate of the University

of Virginia, and of distinguished family, if his story might be believed,

and, it was evident, a man of the world and of extensive travel and

adventure.



To find in such an out of the way country place a woman like Laura was a

piece of good luck upon which Col. Selby congratulated himself.  He was

studiously polite to her and treated her with a consideration to which

she was unaccustomed.  She had read of such men, but she had never seen

one before, one so high-bred, so noble in sentiment, so entertaining in

conversation, so engaging in manner.



It is a long story; unfortunately it is an old story, and it need not be

dwelt on.  Laura loved him, and believed that his love for her was as

pure and deep as her own.  She worshipped him and would have counted her

life a little thing to give him, if he would only love her and let her

feed the hunger of her heart upon him.



The passion possessed her whole being, and lifted her up, till she seemed

to walk on air.  It was all true, then, the romances she had read, the

bliss of love she had dreamed of.  Why had she never noticed before how

blithesome the world was, how jocund with love; the birds sang it, the

trees whispered it to her as she passed, the very flowers beneath her

feet strewed the way as for a bridal march.



When the Colonel went away they were engaged to be married, as soon as he

could make certain arrangements which he represented to be necessary, and

quit the army.  He wrote to her from Harding, a small town in the

southwest corner of the state, saying that he should be held in the

service longer than he had expected, but that it would not be more than a

few months, then he should be at liberty to take her to Chicago where he

had property, and should have business, either now or as soon as the war

was over, which he thought could not last long.  Meantime why should they

be separated?  He was established in comfortable quarters, and if she

could find company and join him, they would be married, and gain so many

more months of happiness.



Was woman ever prudent when she loved?  Laura went to Harding, the

neighbors supposed to nurse Washington who had fallen ill there.

Her engagement was, of course, known in Hawkeye, and was indeed a matter

of pride to her family.  Mrs. Hawkins would have told the first inquirer

that.  Laura had gone to be married; but Laura had cautioned her; she did

not want to be thought of, she said, as going in search of a husband; let

the news come back after she was married.



So she traveled to Harding on the pretence we have mentioned, and was

married.  She was married, but something must have happened on that very

day or the next that alarmed her.  Washington did not know then or after

what it was, but Laura bound him not to send news of her marriage to

Hawkeye yet, and to enjoin her mother not to speak of it.  Whatever cruel

suspicion or nameless dread this was, Laura tried bravely to put it away,

and not let it cloud her happiness.



Communication that summer, as may be imagined, was neither regular nor

frequent between the remote confederate camp at Harding and Hawkeye, and

Laura was in a measure lost sight of--indeed, everyone had troubles

enough of his own without borrowing from his neighbors.



Laura had given herself utterly to her husband, and if he had faults, if

he was selfish, if he was sometimes coarse, if he was dissipated, she did

not or would not see it.  It was the passion of her life, the time when

her whole nature went to flood tide and swept away all barriers.  Was her

husband ever cold or indifferent?  She shut her eyes to everything but

her sense of possession of her idol.



Three months passed.  One morning her husband informed her that he had

been ordered South, and must go within two hours.



"I can be ready," said Laura, cheerfully.



"But I can't take you.  You must go back to Hawkeye."



"Can't-take-me?" Laura asked, with wonder in her eyes.  "I can't live

without you.  You said-----"



"O bother what I said,"--and the Colonel took up his sword to buckle it

on, and then continued coolly, "the fact is Laura, our romance is played

out."



Laura heard, but she did not comprehend.  She caught his arm and cried,

"George, how can you joke so cruelly?  I will go any where with you.

I will wait any where.  I can't go back to Hawkeye."



"Well, go where you like.  Perhaps," continued he with a sneer, "you

would do as well to wait here, for another colonel."



Laura's brain whirled.  She did not yet comprehend.  "What does this

mean?  Where are you going?"



"It means," said the officer, in measured words, "that you haven't

anything to show for a legal marriage, and that I am going to New

Orleans."



"It's a lie, George, it's a lie.  I am your wife.  I shall go.  I shall

follow you to New Orleans."



"Perhaps my wife might not like it!"



Laura raised her head, her eyes flamed with fire, she tried to utter a

cry, and fell senseless on the floor.



When she came to herself the Colonel was gone.  Washington Hawkins stood

at her bedside.  Did she come to herself?  Was there anything left in her

heart but hate and bitterness, a sense of an infamous wrong at the hands

of the only man she had ever loved?



She returned to Hawkeye.  With the exception of Washington and his

mother, no one knew what had happened.  The neighbors supposed that the

engagement with Col. Selby had fallen through.  Laura was ill for a long

time, but she recovered; she had that resolution in her that could

conquer death almost.  And with her health came back her beauty, and an

added fascination, a something that might be mistaken for sadness.  Is

there a beauty in the knowledge of evil, a beauty that shines out in the

face of a person whose inward life is transformed by some terrible

experience?  Is the pathos in the eyes of the Beatrice Cenci from her

guilt or her innocence?



Laura was not much changed.  The lovely woman had a devil in her heart.

That was all.









CHAPTER XIX.



Mr. Harry Brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the

City Hotel in Hawkeye.  Mr. Thompson had been kind enough to say that it

didn't make any difference whether he was with the corps or not; and

although Harry protested to the Colonel daily and to Washington Hawkins

that he must go back at once to the line and superintend the lay-out with

reference to his contract, yet he did not go, but wrote instead long

letters to Philip, instructing him to keep his eye out, and to let him

know when any difficulty occurred that required his presence.



Meantime Harry blossomed out in the society of Hawkeye, as he did in any

society where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to

expand.  Indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow like

Harry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place.  A land

operator, engaged in vast speculations, a favorite in the select circles

of New York, in correspondence with brokers and bankers, intimate with

public men at Washington, one who could play the guitar and touch the

banjo lightly, and who had an eye for a pretty girl, and knew the

language of flattery, was welcome everywhere in Hawkeye.  Even Miss Laura

Hawkins thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him, and to

endeavor to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her

attractions.



"Gad," says Harry to the Colonel, "she's a superb creature, she'd make a

stir in New York, money or no money.  There are men I know would give her

a railroad or an opera house, or whatever she wanted--at least they'd

promise."



Harry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the

world he wanted, and he half resolved to appropriate Miss Laura, during

his stay in Hawkeye.  Perhaps the Colonel divined his thoughts, or was

offended at Harry's talk, for he replied,



"No nonsense, Mr. Brierly.  Nonsense won't do in Hawkeye, not with my

friends.  The Hawkins' blood is good blood, all the way from Tennessee.

The Hawkinses are under the weather now, but their Tennessee property is

millions when it comes into market."



"Of course, Colonel.  Not the least offense intended.  But you can see

she is a fascinating woman.  I was only thinking, as to this

appropriation, now, what such a woman could do in Washington.  All

correct, too, all correct.  Common thing, I assure you in Washington; the

wives of senators, representatives, cabinet officers, all sorts of wives,

and some who are not wives, use their influence.  You want an

appointment?  Do you go to Senator X?  Not much.  You get on the right

side of his wife.  Is it an appropriation?  You'd go 'straight to the

Committee, or to the Interior office, I suppose?  You'd learn better than

that.  It takes a woman to get any thing through the Land Office: I tell

you, Miss Laura would fascinate an appropriation right through the Senate

and the House of Representatives in one session, if she was in

Washington, as your friend, Colonel, of course as your friend."



"Would you have her sign our petition?" asked the Colonel, innocently.



Harry laughed.  "Women don't get anything by petitioning Congress; nobody

does, that's for form.  Petitions are referred somewhere, and that's the

last of them; you can't refer a handsome woman so easily, when she is

present.  They prefer 'em mostly."



The petition however was elaborately drawn up, with a glowing description

of Napoleon and the adjacent country, and a statement of the absolute

necessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the stations on

the great through route to the Pacific, of the, immediate improvement of

Columbus River; to this was appended a map of the city and a survey of

the river.  It was signed by all the people at Stone's Landing who could

write their names, by Col. Beriah Sellers, and the Colonel agreed to have

the names headed by all the senators and representatives from the state

and by a sprinkling of ex-governors and ex-members of congress.  When

completed it was a formidable document.  Its preparation and that of more

minute plots of the new city consumed the valuable time of Sellers and

Harry for many weeks, and served to keep them both in the highest

spirits.



In the eyes of Washington Hawkins, Harry was a superior being, a man who

was able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm.

He never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of

what he was going to do.  As for Washington, Harry thought he was a man

of ability and comprehension, but "too visionary," he told the Colonel.

The Colonel said he might be right, but he had never noticed anything

visionary about him.



"He's got his plans, sir.  God bless my soul, at his age, I was full of

plans.  But experience sobers a man, I never touch any thing now that

hasn't been weighed in my judgment; and when Beriah Sellers puts his

judgment on a thing, there it is."



Whatever might have been Harry's intentions with regard to Laura, he saw

more and more of her every day, until he got to be restless and nervous

when he was not with her.



That consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the

fascination was mainly on his side, and so worked upon his vanity, while

inflaming his ardor, that he scarcely knew what he was about.  Her

coolness and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions of a

modest timidity, and attracted him even more than the little tendernesses

into which she was occasionally surprised.  He could never be away from

her long, day or evening; and in a short time their intimacy was the town

talk.  She played with him so adroitly that Harry thought she was

absorbed in love for him, and yet he was amazed that he did not get on

faster in his conquest.



And when he thought of it, he was piqued as well.  A country girl, poor

enough, that was evident; living with her family in a cheap and most

unattractive frame house, such as carpenters build in America, scantily

furnished and unadorned; without the adventitious aids of dress or jewels

or the fine manners of society--Harry couldn't understand it.  But she

fascinated him, and held him just beyond the line of absolute familiarity

at the same time.  While he was with her she made him forget that the

Hawkins' house was nothing but a wooden tenement, with four small square

rooms on the ground floor and a half story; it might have been a palace

for aught he knew.



Perhaps Laura was older than Harry.  She was, at any rate, at that ripe

age when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of

girlhood, and she had come to understand her powers perfectly, and to

know exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl it

was profitable to retain.  She saw that many women, with the best

intentions, make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into

womanhood.  Such a woman would have attracted Harry at any time, but only

a woman with a cool brain and exquisite art could have made him lose his

head in this way; for Harry thought himself a man of the world.  The

young fellow never dreamed that he was merely being experimented on; he

was to her a man of another society and another culture, different from

that she had any knowledge of except in books, and she was not unwilling

to try on him the fascinations of her mind and person.



For Laura had her dreams.  She detested the narrow limits in which her

lot was cast, she hated poverty.  Much of her reading had been of modern

works of fiction, written by her own sex, which had revealed to her

something of her own powers and given her indeed, an exaggerated notion

of the influence, the wealth, the position a woman may attain who has

beauty and talent and ambition and a little culture, and is not too

scrupulous in the use of them.  She wanted to be rich, she wanted luxury,

she wanted men at her feet, her slaves, and she had not--thanks to some

of the novels she had read--the nicest discrimination between notoriety

and reputation; perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is

to the bloom of womanhood.



With the other Hawkins children Laura had been brought up in the belief

that they had inherited a fortune in the Tennessee Lands.  She did not by

any means share all the delusion of the family; but her brain was not

seldom busy with schemes about it.  Washington seemed to her only to

dream of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him in

a golden shower; but she was impatient, and wished she were a man to take

hold of the business.



"You men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go

about the world," she said to Harry one day, when he had been talking of

New York and Washington and his incessant engagements.



"Oh, yes," replied that martyr to business, "it's all well enough, if you

don't have too much of it, but it only has one object."



"What is that?"



"If a woman doesn't know, it's useless to tell her.  What do you suppose

I am staying in Hawkeye for, week after week, when I ought to be with my

corps?"



"I suppose it's your business with Col. Sellers about Napoleon, you've

always told me so," answered Laura, with a look intended to contradict

her words.



"And now I tell you that is all arranged, I suppose you'll tell me I

ought to go?"



"Harry!" exclaimed Laura, touching his arm and letting her pretty hand

rest there a moment.  "Why should I want you to go away?  The only person

in Hawkeye who understands me."



"But you refuse to understand me," replied Harry, flattered but still

petulant.  "You are like an iceberg, when we are alone."



Laura looked up with wonder in her great eyes, and something like a blush

suffusing her face, followed by a look of langour that penetrated Harry's

heart as if it had been longing.



"Did I ever show any want of confidence in you, Harry?"  And she gave him

her hand, which Harry pressed with effusion--something in her manner told

him that he must be content with that favor.



It was always so.  She excited his hopes and denied him, inflamed his

passion and restrained it, and wound him in her toils day by day.  To

what purpose?  It was keen delight to Laura to prove that she had power

over men.



Laura liked to hear about life at the east, and especially about the

luxurious society in which Mr. Brierly moved when he was at home.  It

pleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it.



"You should be a winter in Washington," Harry said.



"But I have no acquaintances there."



"Don't know any of the families of the congressmen?  They like to have a

pretty woman staying with them."



"Not one."



"Suppose Col. Sellers should, have business there; say, about this

Columbus River appropriation?"



"Sellers!" and Laura laughed.



"You needn't laugh.  Queerer things have happened.  Sellers knows

everybody from Missouri, and from the West, too, for that matter.  He'd

introduce you to Washington life quick enough.  It doesn't need a crowbar

to break your way into society there as it does in Philadelphia.  It's

democratic, Washington is.  Money or beauty will open any door.  If I

were a handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital

to pick up a prince or a fortune."



"Thank you," replied Laura.  "But I prefer the quiet of home, and the

love of those I know;" and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and

unworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day.



Nevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and

bore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built up

a plan on it, and almost a career for herself.  Why not, she said, why

shouldn't I do as other women have done?  She took the first opportunity

to see Col. Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit.  How

was he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take

him from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?



"Well, maybe.  If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington, and

look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home.  It's been

suggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the children.

Maybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington.  But

Dilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you

could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old

settler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a

respect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel

goes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't been

enough thought of in connection with Napoleon.  He's an able man,

Dilworthy, and a good man.  A man has got to be good to succeed as he

has.  He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a

million.  First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked

about family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast.

I hated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him we

didn't have 'em, not steady.  He said he understood, business

interruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as for

him he never neglected the ordinances of religion.  He doubted if the

Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the

Divine Blessing on it."



Perhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy had

not stayed with Col. Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to his

house being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those

instant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into

his brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and

without interrupting the flow of it.



During the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit

in Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he

and the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing, to

introduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he

departed.  Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took

Philip round to see his western prize.



Laura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that

rather surprised and not a little interested him.  He saw at once that

she was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading

his friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed.  At least he

thought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at

once; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was

certainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated

Philip with the greatest consideration.  She deferred to his opinions,

and listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank manner

with an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that whatever she

might feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him.  Perhaps his manly

way did win her liking.  Perhaps in her mind, she compared him with

Harry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole

soul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it.  Philip was not

invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her presence.



The week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade

Laura good by, he seemed to have known her a year.



"We shall see you again, Mr. Sterling," she said as she gave him her

hand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes.



And when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have

disturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square

letter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed "Ruth."









CHAPTER XX.



The visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye.  When a

Senator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding

the destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and

accept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not

considered a light one.  All, parties are flattered by it and politics

are forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows.



Senator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist

in the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that

any reason why Col. Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not

thriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?



The Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it almost

appeared that he was indebted to Col. Sellers for the unreserved

hospitalities of the town.  It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a

manner, gave him the freedom of the city.



"You are known here, sir," said the Colonel," and Hawkeye is proud of

you.  You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone.

I should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by

your older friend Gen. Boswell.  But you will mingle with our people, and

you will see here developments that will surprise you."



The Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the

impression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own

mansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him

as his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain

viands on his table.  He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning

of the day the Senator was going away.



Senator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant

spoken man, a popular man with the people.



He took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country,

and made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education,

and of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated

race.



"Providence," he said, "has placed them in our hands, and although you

and I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under the

Constitution, yet Providence knows best."



"You can't do much with 'em," interrupted Col. Sellers.  "They are a

speculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without

security, planning how to live by only working for themselves.  Idle,

sir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds.  Nothing practical in 'em."



"There is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate

them."



"You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was

before.  If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what

will he do then?"



"But, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his

speculations fruitful."



"Never, sir, never.  He would only have a wider scope to injure himself.

A niggro has no grasp, sir.  Now, a white man can conceive great

operations, and carry them out; a niggro can't."



"Still," replied the Senator, "granting that he might injure himself in a

worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply his

chances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all,

Colonel.  And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by

this being."



"I'd elevate his soul," promptly responded the Colonel; "that's just it;

you can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself.

Yes, sir!  make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he

is."



Of course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public

reception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his

fellow citizens.  Col. Sellers was master of ceremonies.  He escorted the

band from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession

of Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons of

Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca, the

Sunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the

Senator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every

one else was seated, and loudly cried "Order!" in the dead silence which

preceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell.  The occasion

was one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he

long dwelt on with pleasure.



This not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to

give Senator Dilworthy's speech in full.  He began somewhat as follows:



"Fellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with

you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and

burdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in

your great state.  The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections

is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties.  I look forward with longing

to the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--" ["dam sight,"

shouted a tipsy fellow near the door.  Cries of "put him out."]



"My friends, do not remove him.  Let the misguided man stay.  I see that

he is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and

sapping the foundation of society.  As I was saying, when I can lay down

the cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such

sweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye

(applause).  I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our glorious

union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours, or one that

has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity--

(more applause)."



The Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt

for an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened

it.



He then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon

the necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality.

"I trust," he said, "that there are children within the sound of my

voice," and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an

apostrophe to "the genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday

School in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of

the National Capitol."



Col. Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so

influential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the

navigation of Columbus river.  He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over

to Napoleon and opened to him their plan.  It was a plan that the Senator

could understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to be

familiar with the like improvements elsewhere.  When, however, they

reached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,



"Is this Napoleon?"



"This is the nucleus, the nucleus," said the Colonel, unrolling his map.

"Here is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on."



"Ah, I see.  How far from here is Columbus River?  Does that stream

empty----"



"That, why, that's Goose Run.  Thar ain't no Columbus, thout'n it's over

to Hawkeye," interrupted one of the citizens, who had come out to stare

at the strangers.  "A railroad come here last summer, but it haint been

here no mo'."



"Yes, sir," the Colonel hastened to explain, "in the old records Columbus

River is called Goose Run.  You see how it sweeps round the town-forty-

nine miles to the Missouri; sloop navigation all the way pretty much,

drains this whole country; when it's improved steamboats will run right

up here.  It's got to be enlarged, deepened.  You see by the map.

Columbus River.  This country must have water communication!"



"You'll want a considerable appropriation, Col. Sellers.



"I should say a million; is that your figure Mr. Brierly."



"According to our surveys," said Harry, "a million would do it; a million

spent on the river would make Napoleon worth two millions at least."



"I see," nodded the Senator.  "But you'd better begin by asking only for

two or three hundred thousand, the usual way.  You can begin to sell town

lots on that appropriation you know."



The Senator, himself, to do him justice, was not very much interested in

the country or the stream, but he favored the appropriation, and he gave

the Colonel and Mr. Brierly to and understand that he would endeavor to

get it through.  Harry, who thought he was shrewd and understood

Washington, suggested an interest.



But he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion.



"You will offend me by repeating such an observation," he said.

"Whatever I do will be for the public interest.  It will require a

portion of the appropriation for necessary expenses, and I am sorry to

say that there are members who will have to be seen.  But you can reckon

upon my humble services."



This aspect of the subject was not again alluded to.  The Senator

possessed himself of the facts, not from his observation of the ground,

but from the lips of Col. Sellers, and laid the appropriation scheme away

among his other plans for benefiting the public.



It was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of Mr.

Washington Hawkins, and was greatly taken with his innocence, his

guileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon

any plan proposed.



Col. Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had

awakened, especially since it was likely to further his expectations with

regard to the Tennessee lands; the Senator having remarked to the

Colonel, that he delighted to help any deserving young man, when the

promotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to

contribute to the general good.  And he did not doubt that this was an

opportunity of that kind.



The result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator

proposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private

secretary and the secretary of his committee; a proposal which was

eagerly accepted.



The Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church.  He cheered the

heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his sympathy

in his labors, and by many inquiries in regard to the religious state of

the region.  It was not a very promising state, and the good man felt how

much lighter his task would be, if he had the aid of such a man as

Senator Dilworthy.



"I am glad to see, my dear sir," said the Senator, "that you give them

the doctrines.  It is owing to a neglect of the doctrines, that there is

such a fearful falling away in the country.  I wish that we might have

you in Washington--as chaplain, now, in the senate."



The good man could not but be a little flattered, and if sometimes,

thereafter, in his discouraging work, he allowed the thought that he

might perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate, to cheer

him, who can wonder.  The Senator's commendation at least did one service

for him, it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye.



Laura was at church alone that day, and Mr. Brierly walked home with her.

A part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator

Dilworthy, and introductions were made.  Laura had her own reasons for

wishing to know the Senator, and the Senator was not a man who could be

called indifferent to charms such as hers.  That meek young lady so

commended herself to him in the short walk, that he announced his

intentions of paying his respects to her the next day, an intention which

Harry received glumly; and when the Senator was out of hearing he called

him "an old fool."



"Fie," said Laura, "I do believe you are jealous, Harry.  He is a very

pleasant man.  He said you were a young man of great promise."



The Senator did call next day, and the result of his visit was that he

was confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very

attractive to ladies.  He saw Laura again and again daring his stay, and

felt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty, which

every man felt who came near her.



Harry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town;

he declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher game;

and he attributed his own ill-luck to the Senator's appearance.  The

fellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his brains

out in chagrin.  Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment, but she soothed him

with blandishments that increased his ardor, and she smiled to herself to

think that he had, with all his protestations of love, never spoken of

marriage.  Probably the vivacious fellow never had thought of it.  At any

rate when he at length went away from Hawkeye he was no nearer it.  But

there was no telling to what desperate lengths his passion might not

carry him.



Laura bade him good bye with tender regret, which, however, did not

disturb her peace or interfere with her plans.  The visit of Senator

Dilworthy had become of more importance to her, and it by and by bore the

fruit she longed for, in an invitation to visit his family in the

National Capital during the winter session of Congress.









CHAPTER XXI.



                              O lift your natures up:

               Embrace our aims: work out your freedom.  Girls,

               Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed;

               Drink deep until the habits of the slave,

               The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite

               And slander, die.

                                   The Princess.



Whether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting a

living out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her

first term was over at the medical school that there were other things

she needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical

books, and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more

general culture.



"Does your doctor know any thing--I don't mean about medicine, but about

things in general, is he a man of information and good sense?" once asked

an old practitioner.  "If he doesn't know any thing but medicine the

chance is he doesn't know that:"



The close application to her special study was beginning to tell upon

Ruth's delicate health also, and the summer brought with it only

weariness and indisposition for any mental effort.



In this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the

unexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever tiresome.



She followed with more interest Philip's sparkling account of his life

in the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of those

people of a world so different from here, who alternately amused and

displeased him.  He at least was learning the world, the good and the bad

of it, as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it.



But what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast into

particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to

extricate herself?  Philip thought that he would go some day and

extricate Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to

know that this was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must

find out by her own experience what her heart really wanted.



Philip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old fashioned

notion, that whatever a woman's theories of life might be, she would come

round to matrimony, only give her time.  He could indeed recall to mind

one woman--and he never knew a nobler--whose whole soul was devoted and

who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent

project in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of matrimony, as

an icicle yields to a sunbeam.



Neither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit any

weariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked out

for herself.  But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with

infirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful

composure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to

her.  She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene

and of occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the

knowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course

for which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.



It therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came, that

Ruth should go away to school.  She selected a large New England

Seminary, of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended

by both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education.

Thither she went in September, and began for the second time in the year

a life new to her.



The Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to three

thousand inhabitants.  It was a prosperous school, with three hundred

students, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a venerable

rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the town.  The

students lodged and boarded in private families in the place, and so it

came about that while the school did a great deal to support the town,

the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of home life.

It is at least respectful to say that the influences of home life are

sweet.



Ruth's home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family--one of the

rare exceptions in life or in fiction--that had never known better days.

The Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to come over in

the Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness of a

child.  They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel, and thus

escaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of

the Mayflower Pilgrims have descended.  Having no factitious weight of

dignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their condition from

the day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or prosperous than

at the date of this narrative.  With character compacted by the rigid

Puritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained its

strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now

blossoming under the generous modern influences.  Squire Oliver Montague,

a lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in

rare cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mile away from

the green.  It was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample

fields about it, and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road,

and on the west commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle

slopes and nodding were now blossoming under the generous modern

influences.  Squire Oliver Montague, a lawyer who had retired from the

practice of his profession except in rare cases, dwelt in a square old

fashioned New England groves.  But it was just a plain, roomy house,

capable of extending to many guests an unpretending hospitality.



The family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter

married and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at

the Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older than

Ruth.  Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable

desires, and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a

pleasure, the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely

attained, and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent.



If Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home,

there were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest

in the affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her.  Every room

had its book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon

every table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals and

daily newspapers.  There were plants in the sunny windows and some choice

engravings on the walls, with bits of color in oil or water-colors;

the piano was sure to be open and strewn with music; and there were

photographs and little souvenirs here and there of foreign travel.

An absence of any "what-pots" in the corners with rows of cheerful

shells, and Hindoo gods, and Chinese idols, and nests of use less boxes

of lacquered wood, might be taken as denoting a languidness in the family

concerning foreign missions, but perhaps unjustly.



At any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable

house, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day,

of the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York

civilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very

poor chance.



All this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed

into another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a mental

exhilaration unknown to her before.  Under this influence she entered

upon her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the

relaxation she needed, in the charming social life at the Montague house.



It is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters,

that you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely

mentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,

knows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor,

and an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious

often--one of your "capable" New England girls.  We shall be great

friends.  It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing

extraordinary about the family that needed mention.  He knew dozens of

girls like Alice, he thought to himself, but only one like Ruth.



Good friends the two girls were from the beginning.  Ruth was a study to

Alice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience, so

much a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in turn,

it must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious grey eyes,

wondered what her object in life was, and whether she had any purpose

beyond living as she now saw her.  For she could scarcely conceive of a

life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of some definite

work, and she had-no doubt that in her own case everything else would

yield to the professional career she had marked out.



"So you know Philip Sterling," said Ruth one day as the girls sat at

their sewing.  Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could

avoid it.  Bless her.



"Oh yes, we are old friends.  Philip used to come to Fallkill often while

he was in college.  He was once rusticated here for a term."



"Rusticated?"



"Suspended for some College scrape.  He was a great favorite here.

Father and he were famous friends.  Father said that Philip had no end of

nonsense in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a

royal good fellow and would come out all right."



"Did you think he was fickle?"



"Why, I never thought whether he was or not," replied Alice looking up.

"I suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as college

boys are.  He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be terribly

in the dumps."



"Why did he come to you?" pursued Ruth you were younger than he."



"I'm sure I don't know.  He was at our house a good deal.  Once at a

picnic by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie

from drowning, and we all liked to have him here.  Perhaps he thought as

he had saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in

trouble.  I don't know."



The fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because she

never betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return.  There are

persons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and heart-

aches flow as naturally its streams to a placid lake.



This is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy as

both are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into long

loitering with them.  If the reader visits the village to-day, he will

doubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived, the

cross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable chapel

with its cracked bell.



In the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite, and

no considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete

without her.  There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet

deep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society

about her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that would have

made her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to

recall her to mind.



To the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village

with a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted her

life to a serious profession from the highest motives.  Alice liked

society well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting in that

of Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the well-bred young

gentlemen one met in it.  It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth,

for she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity, and then with

interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one would have

deemed possible for her.  Parties, picnics, rowing-matches, moonlight

strolls, nutting expeditions in the October woods,--Alice declared that

it was a whirl of dissipation.  The fondness of Ruth, which was scarcely

disguised, for the company of agreeable young fellows, who talked

nothings, gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter.



"Do you look upon them as I subjects, dear?" she would ask.



And Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again.

Perhaps she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.



If you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it would

swim if you brought it to the Nile.



Surely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she

would become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so unlike

that she thought she desired.  But no one can tell how a woman will act

under any circumstances.  The reason novelists nearly always fail in

depicting women when they make them act, is that they let them do what

they have observed some woman has done at sometime or another.  And that

is where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again what has

been done before.  It is this uncertainty that causes women, considered

as materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves and to

others.



As the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself

greatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently

gave her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of

power which had awakened within her.









CHAPTER XXII.

In mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants

of the Montague house, and to the friends of the young ladies who sought

their society.



This was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from

the west.



It is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public

houses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but

that his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter

there, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is

allowed to depart with his scalp safe.



The two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary,

nor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance solicitors, three

suppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at

the hotel in respect to the names of "Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly,

Missouri," on the register.  They were handsome enough fellows, that was

evident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free and lordly way

about them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself.  Indeed, he very

soon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune, with enormous

interests on his shoulders.  Harry had a way of casually mentioning

western investments, through lines, the freighting business, and the

route through the Indian territory to Lower California, which was

calculated to give an importance to his lightest word.



"You've a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking hotel

I've seen out of New York," said Harry to the clerk; "we shall stay here

a few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments."



Harry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such

fellows always do have in this accommodating world.  Philip would have

been quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no

resisting Harry's generosity in such matters.



Railroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill during

the winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of the lull

to come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his friends,

the railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt Lick Union

Pacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle the prospects of

the new city at Stone's Landing, and to procure congressional

appropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run navigable.  Harry

had with him a map of that noble stream and of the harbor, with a perfect

net-work of railroads centering in it, pictures of wharves, crowded with

steamboats, and of huge grain-elevators on the bank, all of which grew

out of the combined imaginations of Col. Sellers and Mr. Brierly.  The

Colonel had entire confidence in Harry's influence with Wall street, and

with congressmen, to bring about the consummation of their scheme, and he

waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye, feeding his pinched

family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a reckless prodigality.



"Don't let 'em into the thing more than is necessary," says the Colonel

to Harry; "give 'em a small interest; a lot apiece in the suburbs of the

Landing ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you'll have to mortgage a

part of the city itself to the brokers."



Harry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone's Landing in

Wall street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such

maps as he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked

with more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of

Columbus River, and were not disinclined to form a company for that

purpose.  An appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of

it, and it made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long

as you got hold of it.



Pending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to take a

little run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young man would

at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West at sight

of a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a facility in

love making which made it not at all an interference with the more

serious business of life.  He could not, to be sure, conceive how Philip

could be interested in a young lady who was studying medicine, but he had

no objection to going, for he did not doubt that there were other girls

in Fallkill who were worth a week's attention.



The young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the

hospitality which never failed there.



"We are glad to see you again," exclaimed the Squire heartily, "you are

welcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil's is welcome at our house"



"It's more like home to me, than any place except my own home," cried

Philip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general

hand-shaking.



"It's a long time, though, since you have been here to say so," Alice

said, with her father's frankness of manner; "and I suspect we owe the

visit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary."



Philip's color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell-tale

face, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in with,



"That accounts for Phil's wish to build a Seminary at Stone's Landing,

our place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be a

University.  Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries."



"It would have been better for your friend Sellers," retorted Philip,

"if he had had a weakness for district schools.  Col. Sellers, Miss

Alice, is a great friend of Harry's, who is always trying to build a

house by beginning at the top."



"I suppose it's as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary, and

it looks better," was Harry's reflection; at which the Squire laughed,

and said he quite agreed with him.  The old gentleman understood Stone's

Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an hour's talk

with either of it's expectant proprietors.



At this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that he

found it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened

quietly, and Ruth entered.  Taking in the, group with a quick glance, her

eye lighted up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with

Philip.  She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made

that hero of the west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.



For months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it to

himself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like this.

He should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from the

school, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her, and

she would cry "Oh!  Phil," and then check herself, and perhaps blush, and

Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his warm

manner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look up

timidly, and, after his' long absence, perhaps he would be permitted to

Good heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and wondered if

it could happen so.  Well, well; he had never supposed that he should be

the one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial welcome.



"We heard you were at the Sassacus House," were Ruth's first words; "and

this I suppose is your friend?"



"I beg your pardon," Philip at length blundered out, "this is Mr. Brierly

of whom I have written you."



And Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due

to his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with her

reception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the other

sex.



Questions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the

conversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself

talking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he

couldn't keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an

animated discourse, and caught the words "New York," and "opera," and

"reception," and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range in

the world of fashion.



Harry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said so)

and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining

stories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and the

basso here, humming the beginning of their airs--tum-ti-tum-ti-ti--

suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative--down-

among-the-dead-men--and touching off the whole with an airy grace quite

captivating; though he couldn't have sung a single air through to save

himself, and he hadn't an ear to know whether it was sung correctly.  All

the same he doted on the opera, and kept a box there, into which he

lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene and meet his society

friends.



If Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the

disposal of Ruth and her friends.  Needless to say that she was delighted

with the offer.



When she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled, and

said that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some

evening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to

some other friend.



The Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and

urged them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but

Philip had reasons for declining.  They staid to supper, however, and in;

the evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to

him, in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at

Philadelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and

prospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an

interest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip--it was too

general and not personal enough to suit him.  And with all her freedom in

speaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference to

himself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not

think of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not

reference to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she

could not share it.  Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except

in Ruth's eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth

was not on this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness

and live in a purposeless seclusion.



"I hoped," said Philip; "to get a little start in connection with this

new railroad, and make a little money, so that I could came east and

engage in something more suited to my tastes.  I shouldn't like to live

in the West.  Would you?



"It never occurred to me whether I would or not," was the unembarrassed

reply.  "One of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a nice practice

there.  I don't know where I shall go.  It would mortify mother

dreadfully to have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor's gig."



Philip laughed at the idea of it.  "And does it seem as necessary to you

to do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?"



It was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at

once thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen and

ladies of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to admit

to herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change.



"Oh, I don't think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must do

something when I am through school; and why not medicine?"



Philip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation would be

of no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.



Harry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague

about the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus

River, the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a

shorter Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one; or

diverting Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or

drawing for Miss Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New

England and the border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining

fellow, having his imagination to help his memory, and telling his

stories as if he believed them--as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly

amused with Harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that he

exceeded his usual limits.  Chance allusions to his bachelor

establishment in town and the place of his family on the Hudson, could

not have been made by a millionaire, more naturally.



"I should think," queried Alice, "you would rather stay in New York than

to try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of."



"Oh, adventure," says Harry, "I get tired of New York.  And besides I

got involved in some operations that I had to see through.  Parties in

New York only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big

diamond interest.  I told them, no, no speculation for me.  I've got my

interests in Missouri; and I wouldn't leave Philip, as long as he stays

there."



When the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel, Mr. Philip,

who was not in very good humor, broke out,



"What the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues

for?"



"Go on?" cried Harry.  "Why shouldn't I try to make a pleasant evening?

And besides, ain't I going to do those things?  What difference does it

make about the mood and tense of a mere verb?  Didn't uncle tell me only

last Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for

diamonds?  A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one."



"Nonsense.  You'll get to believing your own romancing by and by."



"Well, you'll see.  When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I'll show

you an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the

opera."



"Yes, it will be like Col. Sellers' plantation at Hawkeye.  Did you ever

see that?"



"Now, don't be cross, Phil.  She's just superb, that little woman.  You

never told me."



"Who's just superb?" growled Philip, fancying this turn of the

conversation less than the other.



"Well, Mrs. Montague, if you must know."  And Harry stopped to light a

cigar, and then puffed on in silence.  The little quarrel didn't last

over night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a

second, and Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and

he had invited Harry to come with him.



The young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at the

Montagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village.  There

were parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the

Montagues were of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his

nature, gave in return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed,

with dancing in the hall, and some refreshments passed round.  And Philip

found the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it.



Before the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the

character of Ruth.  Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society

there surprised him.  He had few opportunities for serious conversation

with her.  There was always some butterfly or another flitting about,

and when Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth

laughed merrily enough and rallied him on his soberness--she declared he

was getting to be grim and unsocial.  He talked indeed more with Alice

than with Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in

his mind.  It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly

enough what was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there

was no remedy for it but time.



"Ruth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as

ever, but don't you see she has just discovered that she is fond of

society?  Don't you let her see you are selfish about it, is my advice."



The last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the

Montagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.

But she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her eye

and in her laugh.  "Confound it," said Philip to himself, "she's in a

perfect twitter."



He would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the

house in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off

miles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain

of the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity.  For

Ruth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times,

and fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and half-

confidences.  She even said "Thee" to him once in reproach for a cutting

speech he began.  And the sweet little word made his heart beat like a

trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said "thee" to him before.



Was she fascinated with Harry's careless 'bon homie' and gay assurance?

Both chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl along in

the most mirthful manner.  Ruth sang for Harry, and that young gentleman

turned the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note now and

then where he thought it would tell.



Yes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was

over, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.



"Farewell Philip.  Good night Mr. Brierly," Ruth's clear voice sounded

after them as they went down the walk.



And she spoke Harry's name last, thought Philip.









CHAPTER XXIII.



               "O see ye not yon narrow road

               So thick beset wi' thorns and briers?

               That is the Path of Righteousness,

               Though after it but few inquires.



               "And see ye not yon braid, braid road,

               That lies across the lily leven?

               That is the Path of Wickedness,

               Though some call it the road to Heaven."



                                             Thomas the Rhymer.



Phillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind.

Harry was buoyant.  He found a letter from Col. Sellers urging him to go

to Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy.  The petition was in his

hands.



It had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri, and would

be presented immediately.



"I should go on myself," wrote the Colonel, "but I am engaged in the

invention of a process for lighting such a city as St. Louis by means of

water; just attach my machine to the water-pipes anywhere and the

decomposition of the fluid begins, and you will have floods of light for

the mere cost of the machine.  I've nearly got the lighting part, but I

want to attach to it a heating, cooking, washing and ironing apparatus.

It's going to be the great thing, but we'd better keep this appropriation

going while I am perfecting it."



Harry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr.

Duff Brown, each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses

where they were well known as men engaged in large private operations for

the public good and men, besides, who, in the slang of the day,

understood the virtues of "addition, division and silence."



Senator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the remark

that he knew, personally, the signers of it, that they were men

interested; it was true, in the improvement of the country, but he

believed without any selfish motive, and that so far as he knew the

signers were loyal.  It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of

many colored citizens, and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to

know that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part in

the development of the resources of their native land.  He moved the

reference of the petition to the proper committee.



Senator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members,

as a person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of

the Pacific, and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey

of Columbus River; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show

the connection between the public treasury, the city of Napoleon and

legislation for the benefit off the whole country.



Harry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy.  There was scarcely any good

movement in which the Senator was not interested.  His house was open to

all the laborers in the field of total abstinence, and much of his time

was taken up in attending the meetings of this cause.  He had a Bible

class in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and he

suggested to Harry that he might take a class during the time he remained

in Washington, Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class.  Harry asked the

Senator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach, and after

that the Senator did not press the subject.



Philip, if the truth must be told, was not well satisfied with his

western prospects, nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with.

The railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises.

Opportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri, but for

himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of the

profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon.  During the summer

he had made considerable practical advance in the science of engineering;

he had been diligent, and made himself to a certain extent necessary to

the work he was engaged on.  The contractors called him into their

consultations frequently, as to the character of the country he had been

over, and the cost of constructing the road, the nature of the work, etc.



Still Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or money

as an engineer, he had a great deal of hard study before him, and it is

to his credit that he did not shrink from it.  While Harry was in

Washington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making

the acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it, Philip devoted

himself day and night, with an energy and a concentration he was capable

of, to the learning and theory of his profession, and to the science of

railroad building.  He wrote some papers at this time for the "Plow, the

Loom and the Anvil," upon the strength of materials, and especially upon

bridge-building, which attracted considerable attention, and were copied

into the English "Practical Magazine."  They served at any rate to raise

Philip in the opinion of his friends the contractors, for practical men

have a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen, and

though they may a little despise the talent, they are quite ready to make

use of it.



Philip sent copies of his performances to Ruth's father and to other

gentlemen whose good opinion he coveted, but he did not rest upon his

laurels.  Indeed, so diligently had he applied himself, that when it came

time for him to return to the West, he felt himself, at least in theory,

competent to take charge of a division in the field.









CHAPTER XXIV.



The capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country-bred

Washington Hawkins.  St. Louis was a greater city, but its floating.

population did not hail from great distances, and so it had the general

family aspect of the permanent population; but Washington gathered its

people from the four winds of heaven, and so the manners, the faces and

the fashions there, presented a variety that was infinite.  Washington

had never been in "society" in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the ways

of its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings.

Consequently, everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was

a new and wonderful revelation to him.



Washington is an interesting city to any of us.  It seems to become more

and more interesting the oftener we visit it.  Perhaps the reader has

never been there?  Very well.  You arrive either at night, rather too

late to do anything or see anything until morning, or you arrive so early

in the morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an

hour or two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic.  You cannot

well arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway

corporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town

or out of it take care of that.  You arrive in tolerably good spirits,

because it is only thirty-eight miles from Baltimore to the capital, and

so you have only been insulted three times (provided you are not in a

sleeping car--the average is higher there): once when you renewed your

ticket after stopping over in Baltimore, once when you were about to

enter the "ladies' car" without knowing it was a lady's car, and once

When you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach Washington.



You are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your

face as you step out upon the sidewalk; you enter what they regard as a

"carriage," in the capital, and you wonder why they do not take it out of

service and put it in the museum: we have few enough antiquities, and

it is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve

the few we have.  You reach your hotel, presently--and here let us draw

the curtain of charity--because of course you have gone to the wrong one.

You being a stranger, how could you do otherwise?  There are a hundred

and eighteen bad hotels, and only one good one.  The most renowned and

popular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one known to history.



It is winter, and night.  When you arrived, it was snowing.  When you

reached the hotel, it was sleeting.  When you went to bed, it was

raining.  During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys

down.  When you got up in the morning, it was foggy.  When you finished

your breakfast at ten o'clock and went out, the sunshine was brilliant,

the weather balmy and delicious, and the mud and slush deep and all-

pervading.  You will like the climate when you get used to it.



You naturally wish to view the city; so you take an umbrella, an

overcoat, and a fan, and go forth.  The prominent features you soon

locate and get familiar with; first you glimpse the ornamental upper

works of a long, snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees, and a

tall, graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and

pleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky.  That building is

the capitol; gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was

to cost $12,000,000, and that the government did come within $21,200,000

of building it for that sum.



You stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view, and it

is a very noble one.  You understand, the capitol stands upon the verge

of a high piece of table land, a fine commanding position, and its front

looks out over this noble situation for a city--but it don't see it, for

the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon, the property

owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures that the

people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh behind the

temple of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building, with, its

imposing colonades, its, projecting, graceful wings, its, picturesque

groups of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps, flowing down

in white marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon a sorrowful

little desert of cheap boarding houses.



So you observe, that you take your view from the back of the capitol.

And yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome, by the way, because to

get there you must pass through the great rotunda: and to do that, you

would have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there,

and the bas-reliefs--and what have you done that you should suffer thus?

And besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the building,

and you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by a young lady

artist for $10,000--and you might take his marble emancipation

proclamation, which he holds out in his hand and contemplates, for a

folded napkin; and you might conceive from his expression and his

attitude, that he is finding fault with the washing.  Which is not the

case.  Nobody knows what is the matter with him; but everybody feels for

him.  Well, you ought not to go into the dome anyhow, because it would be

utterly impossible to go up there without seeing the frescoes in it--and

why should you be interested in the delirium tremens of art?



The capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building, both within

and without, but you need not examine it now.  Still, if you greatly

prefer going into the dome, go.  Now your general glance gives you

picturesque stretches of gleaming water, on your left, with a sail here

and there and a lunatic asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a

distant elevation, you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells

upon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture, for it recalls your

lost boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it

blest and beautiful.  Still in the distance, but on this side of the

water and close to its edge, the Monument to the Father of his Country

towers out of the mud--sacred soil is the, customary term.  It has the

aspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off.  The skeleton of a

decaying scaffolding lingers about its summit, and tradition says that

the spirit of Washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to

enjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol

of its unappeasable gratitude.  The Monument is to be finished, some day,

and at that time our Washington will have risen still higher in the

nation's veneration, and will be known as the Great-Great-Grandfather of

his Country.  The memorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality

that is full of reposeful expression.  With a glass you can see the cow-

sheds about its base, and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the

desert solitudes that surround it, and the tired pigs dozing in the holy

calm of its protecting shadow.



Now you wrench your gaze loose, and you look down in front of you and see

the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile or

more till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared

granite pile, the Treasury building-an edifice that would command respect

in any capital.  The stores and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are

mean, and cheap, and dingy, and are better left without comment.  Beyond

the Treasury is a fine large white barn, with wide unhandsome grounds

about it.  The President lives there.  It is ugly enough outside, but

that is nothing to what it is inside.  Dreariness, flimsiness, bad taste

reduced to mathematical completeness is what the inside offers to the

eye, if it remains yet what it always has been.



The front and right hand views give you the city at large.  It is a wide

stretch of cheap little brick houses, with here and there a noble

architectural pile lifting itself out of the midst-government buildings,

these.  If the thaw is still going on when you come down and go about

town, you will wonder at the short-sightedness of the city fathers, when

you come to inspect the streets, in that they do not dilute the mud a

little more and use them for canals.



If you inquire around a little, you will find that there are more

boardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any

other city in the land, perhaps.  If you apply for a home in one of them,

it will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe

eye and then ask you if you are a member of Congress.  Perhaps, just as a

pleasantry, you will say yes.  And then she will tell you that she is

"full."  Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and

there she stands, convicted and ashamed.  She will try to blush, and it

will be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed.  She shows

you her rooms, now, and lets yon take one--but she makes you pay in

advance for it.  That is what you will get for pretending to be a member

of Congress.  If you had been content to be merely a private citizen,

your trunk would have been sufficient security for your board.  If you

are curious and inquire into this thing, the chances are that your

landlady will be ill-natured enough to say that the person and property

of a Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention, and that with the

tears in her eyes she has seen several of the people's representatives

walk off to their several States and Territories carrying her unreceipted

board bills in their pockets for keepsakes.  And before you have been in

Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe her, too.



Of course you contrive to see everything and find out everything.  And

one of the first and most startling things you find out is, that every

individual you encounter in the City of Washington almost--and certainly

every separate and distinct individual in the public employment, from the

highest bureau chief, clear down to the maid who scrubs Department halls,

the night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy who

purifies the Department spittoons--represents Political Influence.

Unless you can get the ear of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of

a Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use his "influence" in your

behalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature in

Washington.  Mere merit, fitness and capability, are useless baggage to

you without "influence."  The population of Washington consists pretty

much entirely of government employee and the people who board them.

There are thousands of these employees, and they have gathered there from

every corner of the Union and got their berths through the intercession

(command is nearer the word) of the Senators and Representatives of their

respective States.  It would be an odd circumstance to see a girl get

employment at three or four dollars a week in one of the great public

cribs without any political grandee to back her, but merely because she

was worthy, and competent, and a good citizen of a free country that

"treats all persons alike."  Washington would be mildly thunderstruck at

such a thing as that.  If you are a member of Congress, (no offence,) and

one of your constituents who doesn't know anything, and does not want to

go into the bother of learning something, and has no money, and no

employment, and can't earn a living, comes besieging you for help, do you

say, "Come, my friend, if your services were valuable you could get

employment elsewhere--don't want you here?  "Oh, no: You take him to a

Department and say, "Here, give this person something to pass away the

time at--and a salary"--and the thing is done.  You throw him on his

country.  He is his country's child, let his country support him.  There

is something good and motherly about Washington, the grand old benevolent

National Asylum for the Helpless.



The wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the

liberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor.  Such of

them as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress, are

not only liberally paid also, but are remembered in the customary Extra

Compensation bill which slides neatly through, annually, with the general

grab that signalizes the last night of a session, and thus twenty per

cent. is added to their wages, for--for fun, no doubt.



Washington Hawkins' new life was an unceasing delight to him.  Senator

Dilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington's quarters were charming--

gas; running water, hot and cold; bath-room, coal-fires, rich carpets,

beautiful pictures on the walls; books on religion, temperance, public

charities and financial schemes; trim colored servants, dainty food--

everything a body could wish for.  And as for stationery, there was no

end to it; the government furnished it; postage stamps were not needed--

the Senator's frank could convey a horse through the mails, if necessary.



And then he saw such dazzling company.  Renowned generals and admirals

who had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west, went in

and out before him or sat at the Senator's table, solidified into

palpable flesh and blood; famous statesmen crossed his path daily; that

once rare and awe-inspiring being, a Congressman, was become a common

spectacle--a spectacle so common, indeed, that he could contemplate it

without excitement, even without embarrassment; foreign ministers were

visible to the naked eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the

President himself, and lived.  And more; this world of enchantment teemed

with speculation--the whole atmosphere was thick with hand that indeed

was Washington Hawkins' native air; none other refreshed his lungs so

gratefully.  He had found paradise at last.



The more he saw of his chief the Senator, the more he honored him, and

the more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to

stand out.  To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a

man, Washington said in a letter to Louise, was a happy fortune for a

young man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his.



The weeks drifted by;--Harry Brierly flirted, danced, added lustre to the

brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently "buzzed" and "button-

holed" Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme; meantime

Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest--and in others of

equal national importance.  Harry wrote frequently to Sellers, and always

encouragingly; and from these letters it was easy to see that Harry was a

pet with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing through; that

the assistance rendered him by "old Dilworthy" was pretty fair--pretty

fair; "and every little helps, you know," said Harry.



Washington wrote Sellers officially, now and then.  In one of his letters

it appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the

scheme at first, there was now needed but one more vote to compass a

majority report.  Closing sentence:



     "Providence seems to further our efforts."

          (Signed,) "ABNER DILWORTHY, U. S. S.,

                         per WASHINGTON HAWKINS, P. S."



At the end of a week, Washington was able to send the happy news,

officially, as usual,--that the needed vote had been added and the bill

favorably reported from the Committee.  Other letters recorded its perils

in Committee of the whole, and by and by its victory, by just the skin of

its teeth, on third reading and final passage.  Then came letters telling

of Mr. Dilworthy's struggles with a stubborn majority in his own

Committee in the Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one,

till a majority was secured.



Then there was a hiatus.  Washington watched every move on the board, and

he was in a good position to do this, for he was clerk of this committee,

and also one other.  He received no salary as private secretary, but

these two clerkships, procured by his benefactor, paid him an aggregate

of twelve dollars a day, without counting the twenty percent extra

compensation which would of course be voted to him on the last night of

the session.



He saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life

again, and finally worry through.  In the fullness of time he noted its

second reading, and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal came,

and it was put upon its final passage.  Washington listened with bated

breath to the "Aye!" "No!" "No!" "Aye!" of the voters, for a few dread

minutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer.  He ran down from

the gallery and hurried home to wait.



At the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of his

family, and dinner was waiting.  Washington sprang forward, with the

eager question on his lips, and the Senator said:



"We may rejoice freely, now, my son--Providence has crowned our efforts

with success."









CHAPTER XXV.



Washington sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that night.  To Louise he

wrote:



"It is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness

for some manifestation of the Divine favor.  You shall know him, some day

my Louise, and knowing him you will honor him, as I do."



Harry wrote:



"I pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a tough job, there is no

question about that.  There was not a friend to the measure in the House

committee when I began, and not a friend in the Senate committee except

old Dil himself, but they were all fixed for a majority report when I

hauled off my forces.  Everybody here says you can't get a thing like

this through Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on

delivery, but I think I've taught them a thing or two--if I could only

make them believe it.  When I tell the old residenters that this thing

went through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say, 'That's

rather too thin.'  And when I say thin or not thin it's a fact, anyway,

they say, 'Come, now, but do you really believe that?' and when I say I

don't believe anything about it, I know it, they smile and say, 'Well,

you are pretty innocent, or pretty blind, one or the other--there's no

getting around that.'  Why they really do believe that votes have been

bought--they do indeed.  But let them keep on thinking so.  I have found

out that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has a little gift in

the way of argument with men, he can afford to play for an appropriation

against a money bag and give the money bag odds in the game.  We've raked

in $200,000 of Uncle Sam's money, say what they will--and there is more

where this came from, when we want it, and I rather fancy I am the person

that can go in and occupy it, too, if I do say it myself, that shouldn't,

perhaps.  I'll be with you within a week.  Scare up all the men you can,

and put them to work at once.  When I get there I propose to make things

hum."  The great news lifted Sellers into the clouds.  He went to work on

the instant.  He flew hither and thither making contracts, engaging men,

and steeping his soul in the ecstasies of business.  He was the happiest

man in Missouri.  And Louise was the happiest woman; for presently came a

letter from Washington which said:



"Rejoice with me, for the long agony is over!  We have waited patiently

and faithfully, all these years, and now at last the reward is at hand.

A man is to pay our family $40,000 for the Tennessee Land!  It is but a

little sum compared to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long to

see the day when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself,

better take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best

days in this miserable separation.  Besides, I can put this money into

operations here that will increase it a hundred fold, yes, a thousand

fold, in a few months.  The air is full of such chances, and I know our

family would consent in a moment that I should put in their shares with

mine.  Without a doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year

from this time--I put it at the very lowest figure, because it is always

best to be on the safe side--half a million at the very lowest

calculation, and then your father will give his consent and we can marry

at last.  Oh, that will be a glorious day.  Tell our friends the good

news--I want all to share it."



And she did tell her father and mother, but they said, let it be kept

still for the present.  The careful father also told her to write

Washington and warn him not to speculate with the money, but to wait a

little and advise with one or two wise old heads.  She did this.  And she

managed to keep the good news to herself, though it would seem that the

most careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her

radiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended

upon her.



Harry joined the Colonel at Stone's Landing, and that dead place sprang

into sudden life.  A swarm of men were hard at work, and the dull air was

filled with the cheery music of labor.  Harry had been constituted

engineer-in-general, and he threw the full strength of his powers into

his work.  He moved among his hirelings like a king.  Authority seemed to

invest him with a new splendor.  Col. Sellers, as general superintendent

of a great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could be--

and more.  These two grandees went at their imposing "improvement" with

the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the

foundations of the globe.



They turned their first attention to straightening the river just above

the Landing, where it made a deep bend, and where the maps and plans

showed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance

but increase the "fall."  They started a cut-off canal across the

peninsula formed by the bend, and such another tearing up of the earth

and slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men, had

never been seen in that region before.  There was such a panic among the

turtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found within

three miles of Stone's Landing.  They took the young and the aged, the

decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide-water in

disorderly procession, the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs bringing

up the rear.



Saturday night came, but the men were obliged to wait, because the

appropriation had not come.  Harry said he had written to hurry up the

money and it would be along presently.  So the work continued, on Monday.

Stone's Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity, by this time.

Sellers threw a lot or two on the market, "as a feeler," and they sold

well.  He re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and

still had money left.  He started a bank account, in a small way--and

mentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too; to

everybody, in fact; but not as a new thing--on the contrary, as a matter

of life-long standing.  He could not keep from buying trifles every day

that were not wholly necessary, it was such a gaudy thing to get out his

bank-book and draw a check, instead of using his old customary formula,

"Charge it" Harry sold a lot or two, also--and had a dinner party or two

at Hawkeye and a general good time with the money.  Both men held on

pretty strenuously for the coming big prices, however.



At the end of a month things were looking bad.  Harry had besieged the

New York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack-water Navigation

Company with demands, then commands, and finally appeals, but to no

purpose; the appropriation did not come; the letters were not even

answered.  The workmen were clamorous, now.  The Colonel and Harry

retired to consult.



"What's to be done?" said the Colonel.



"Hang'd if I know."



"Company say anything?"



"Not a word."



"You telegraphed yesterday?"



Yes, and the day before, too."



"No answer?"



"None-confound them!"



Then there was a long pause.  Finally both spoke at once:



"I've got it!"



"I've got it!"



"What's yours?" said Harry.



"Give the boys thirty-day orders on the Company for the back pay."



"That's it-that's my own idea to a dot.  But then--but then----"



"Yes, I know," said the Colonel; "I know they can't wait for the orders

to go to New York and be cashed, but what's the reason they can't get

them discounted in Hawkeye?"



"Of course they can.  That solves the difficulty.  Everybody knows the

appropriation's been made and the Company's perfectly good."



So the orders were given and the men appeased, though they grumbled a

little at first.  The orders went well enough for groceries and such

things at a fair discount, and the work danced along gaily for a time.

Two or three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in,

and of course a far-sighted but easy-going journeyman printer wandered

along and started the "Napoleon Weekly Telegraph and Literary

Repository"--a paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary,

and plenty of "fat" conversational tales and double-leaded poetry--all

for two dollars a year, strictly in advance.  Of course the merchants

forwarded the orders at once to New York--and never heard of them again.



At the end of some weeks Harry's orders were a drug in the market--nobody

would take them at any discount whatever.  The second month closed with a

riot.--Sellers was absent at the time, and Harry began an active absence

himself with the mob at his heels.  But being on horseback, he had the

advantage.  He did not tarry in Hawkeye, but went on, thus missing

several appointments with creditors.  He was far on his flight eastward,

and well out of danger when the next morning dawned.  He telegraphed the

Colonel to go down and quiet the laborers--he was bound east for money--

everything would be right in a week--tell the men so--tell them to rely

on him and not be afraid.



Sellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing.

They had gutted the Navigation office, then piled the beautiful engraved

stock-books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the bonfire

while it lasted.  They had a liking for the Colonel, but still they had

some idea of hanging him, as a sort of make-shift that might answer,

after a fashion, in place of more satisfactory game.



But they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first.

Within fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all

rich men.--He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of

Stone's Landing, within a mile and a half of the future post office and

railway station, and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got

east and started the money along.  Now things were blooming and pleasant

again, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on.  The Colonel

divided with them the money he still had in bank--an act which had

nothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide

whatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it was owing to this

very trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were

pinched with famine.



When the men's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone, they hated

themselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches, but it was

too late, now--they agreed to hang him another time--such time as

Providence should appoint.









CHAPTER XXVI.



Rumors of Ruth's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to

Philadelphia in due time, and occasioned no little undertalk among the

Bolton relatives.



Hannah Shoecraft told another, cousin that, for her part, she never

believed that Ruth had so much more "mind" than other people; and Cousin

Hulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration, and that

was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend

Meeting.  The story that Ruth was "engaged" to a young gentleman of

fortune in Fallkill came with the other news, and helped to give point to

the little satirical remarks that went round about Ruth's desire to be a

doctor!



Margaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these

rumors.  They might be true; she knew a woman's nature too well to think

them improbable, but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her

purposes, and that, as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances

and sports by the way, and yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth's

nature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness

and pleasure, to appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the sunshine,

while the current of her resolution flowed steadily on.



That Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she

could, for instance, be interested in that somewhat serious by-play

called "flirtation," or take any delight in the exercise of those little

arts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and charming

because they are not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never suspected

until she went to Fallkill.  She had believed it her duty to subdue her

gaiety of temperament, and let nothing divert her from what are called

serious pursuits: In her limited experience she brought everything to the

judgment of her own conscience, and settled the affairs of all the world

in her own serene judgment hall.  Perhaps her mother saw this, and saw

also that there was nothing in the Friends' society to prevent her from

growing more and more opinionated.



When Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed--though it would

not have been by her--that a medical career did seem a little less

necessary for her than formerly; and coming back in a glow of triumph, as

it were, and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively

society and in new and sympathetic friendship, she anticipated pleasure

in an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society at

home, and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which were

so agreeable at Fallkill.  She expected visits from her new friends, she

would have company, the new books and the periodicals about which all the

world was talking, and, in short, she would have life.



For a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought

with her.  Her mother was delighted with this change in her, with the

improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home affairs.

Her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he did few

things besides; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways, and not less a

keen battle over something she had read.  He had been a great reader all

his life, and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with encyclopaedic

information.  It was one of Ruth's delights to cram herself with some out

of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father; but she almost

always failed.  Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it, and the

mirth of young people, and he would have willingly entered into any

revolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to Friends'

society.



But custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic

and rebellious young lady, as Ruth very soon found.  In spite of all her

brave efforts, her frequent correspondence, and her determined animation,

her books and her music, she found herself settling into the clutches of

the old monotony, and as she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors,

the medical scheme took new hold of her, and seemed to her the only

method of escape.



"Mother, thee does not know how different it is in Fallkill, how much

more interesting the people are one meets, how much more life there is."



"But thee will find the world, child, pretty much all the same, when thee

knows it better.  I thought once as thee does now, and had as little

thought of being a Friend as thee has.  Perhaps when thee has seen more,

thee will better appreciate a quiet life."



"Thee married young.  I shall not marry young, and perhaps not at all,"

said Ruth, with a look of vast experience.



"Perhaps thee doesn't know thee own mind; I have known persons of thy

age who did not.  Did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with

always in Fallkill?"



"Not always," replied Ruth with a little laugh.  "Mother, I think I

wouldn't say 'always' to any one until I have a profession and am as

independent as he is.  Then my love would be a free act, and not in any

way a necessity."



Margaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy.  "Thee will find

that love, Ruth, is a thing thee won't reason about, when it comes, nor

make any bargains about.  Thee wrote that Philip Sterling was at

Fallkill."



"Yes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a very amusing young fellow and

not so serious-minded as Philip, but a bit of a fop maybe."



"And thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?"



"I didn't prefer anybody; but Henry Brierly was good company, which

Philip wasn't always."



"Did thee know thee father had been in correspondence with Philip?"



Ruth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes.



"Oh, it's not about thee."



"What then?" and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone,

probably Ruth herself did not know it.



"It's about some land up in the country.  That man Bigler has got father

into another speculation."



"That odious man!  Why will father have anything to do with him?  Is it

that railroad?"



"Yes.  Father advanced money and took land as security, and whatever has

gone with the money and the bonds, he has on his hands a large tract of

wild land."



"And what has Philip to do with that?"



"It has good timber, if it could ever be got out, and father says that

there must be coal in it; it's in a coal region.  He wants Philip to

survey it, and examine it for indications of coal."



"It's another of father's fortunes, I suppose," said Ruth.  "He has put

away so many fortunes for us that I'm afraid we never shall find them."



Ruth was interested in it nevertheless, and perhaps mainly because Philip

was to be connected with the enterprise.  Mr. Bigler came to dinner with

her father next day, and talked a great deal about Mr. Bolton's

magnificent tract of land, extolled the sagacity that led him to secure

such a property, and led the talk along to another railroad which would

open a northern communication to this very land.



"Pennybacker says it's full of coal, he's no doubt of it, and a railroad

to strike the Erie would make it a fortune."



"Suppose you take the land and work the thing up, Mr. Bigler; you may

have the tract for three dollars an acre."



"You'd throw it away, then," replied Mr. Bigler, "and I'm not the man to

take advantage of a friend.  But if you'll put a mortgage on it for the

northern road, I wouldn't mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is

willing; but Pennybacker, you know, don't go much on land, he sticks to

the legislature."  And Mr. Bigler laughed.



When Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about Philip's connection

with the land scheme.



"There's nothing definite," said Mr. Bolton.  "Philip is showing aptitude

for his profession.  I hear the best reports of him in New York, though

those sharpers don't 'intend to do anything but use him.  I've written

and offered him employment in surveying and examining the land.  We want

to know what it is.  And if there is anything in it that his enterprise

can dig out, he shall have an interest.  I should be glad to give the

young fellow a lift."



All his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift, and

shouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately.  His ledger,

take-it-altogether, would not show a balance on the right side; but

perhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world

where accounts are kept on a different basis.  The left hand of the

ledger will appear the right, looked at from the other side.



Philip, wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of the

city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme, of Harry's flight

and the Colonel's discomfiture.  Harry left in such a hurry that he

hadn't even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good-bye, but he had no doubt

that Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he saw--

a remark which was thrown in for Ruth's benefit.  Col. Sellers had in all

probability, by this time, some other equally brilliant speculation in

his brain.



As to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept

on foot for speculative purposes in Wall street, and he was about to quit

it.  Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered, that he was coming East?

For he was coming, in spite of a letter from Harry in New York, advising

him to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard to

contracts, he to be a little careful about Sellers, who was somewhat

visionary, Harry said.



The summer went on without much excitement for Ruth.  She kept up a

correspondence with Alice, who promised a visit in the fall, she read,

she earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people

as came to the house; but she found herself falling more and more into

reveries, and growing weary of things as they were.  She felt that

everybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker

establishment in Ohio, who visited the Boltons about this time, a father

and son, clad exactly alike, and alike in manners.  The son; however,

who was not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father;

he always addressed his parent as "Brother Plum," and bore himself,

altogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent pins in

his chair.  Both father and son wore the long, single breasted collarless

coats of their society, without buttons, before or behind, but with a row

of hooks and eyes on either side in front.  It was Ruth's suggestion that

the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye sewed on in the

small of the back where the buttons usually are.



Amusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was, it oppressed Ruth

beyond measure; and increased her feeling of being stifled.



It was a most unreasonable feeling.  No home could be pleasanter than

Ruth's.  The house, a little out of the city; was one of those elegant

country residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of

Philadelphia.  A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth

could suggest for comfort, it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept

lawns, with groups of trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with

greenhouse, grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away

in undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang

under forest trees.  The country about teas the perfection of cultivated

landscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary

date, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft

bloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.



It needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise.

One riding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl

swinging in the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old

poetry or the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic.

He could not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of

reports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere.



Ruth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her

had been as unsubstantial as a dream.  Perhaps she so thought it.



"I feel," she once said to her father, "as if I were living in a house of

cards."



"And thee would like to turn it into a hospital?"



"No.  But tell me father," continued Ruth, not to be put off, "is thee

still going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and

entice thee?"



Mr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about "business"

"Such men have their uses, Ruth.  They keep the world active, and I owe a

great many of my best operations to such men.  Who knows, Ruth, but this

new land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler

in, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?"



"Ah, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light.  I do believe

thee wouldn't have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,

if it hadn't had the novelty of an experiment to thee."



"And is thee satisfied with it?"



"If thee means, if I have had enough of it, no.  I just begin to see what

I can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman.  Would

thee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to

come and put me in a cage?"



Mr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and he

did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that

very day which was entirely characteristic of him.



Ruth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of

cards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils

that hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America

have of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity

and luxury hang.



A sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be

forthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures, from

no one of which a dollar could be realized.  It was in vain that he

applied to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period of

sudden panic and no money.  "A hundred thousand!  Mr. Bolton," said

Plumly.  "Good God, if you should ask me for ten, I shouldn't know where

to get it."



And yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.

Bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could not

raise ten thousand dollars.  Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.

Without it he was a beggar.  Mr. Bolton had already Small's notes for a

large amount in his safe, labeled "doubtful;" he had helped him again and

again, and always with the same result.  But Mr. Small spoke with a

faltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant

of his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton

put by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping

together, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar,

who had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.



Beautiful credit!  The foundation of modern society.  Who shall say that

this is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon

human promises?  That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a

whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar

newspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished

speculator in lands and mines this remark:--"I wasn't worth a cent two

years ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars."









CHAPTER XXVII.



It was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling

enterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been

such refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out.  It was hard to come

down to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent

and the most conspicuous man in the community.  It was sad to see his

name disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected at

intervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed

on with rhetorical tar and feathers.



But his friends suffered more on his account than he did.  He was a cork

that could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.



He had to bolster up his wife's spirits every now and then.  On one of

these occasions he said:



"It's all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little

while.  There's $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:

Harry seems to be having some difficulty, but that's to be expected--you

can't move these big operations to the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, you

know.  But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you'll

see!  I expect the news every day now."



"But Beriah, you've been expecting it every day, all along, haven't you?"



"Well, yes; yes--I don't know but I have.  But anyway, the longer it's

delayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start--same as

every day you live brings you nearer to--nearer--"



"The grave?"



"Well, no--not that exactly; but you can't understand these things, Polly

dear--women haven't much head for business, you know.  You make yourself

perfectly comfortable, old lady, and you'll see how we'll trot this right

along.  Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants to--that's

no great matter--there's a bigger thing than that."



"Bigger than $200,000, Beriah?"



"Bigger, child?--why, what's $200,000?  Pocket money!  Mere pocket money!

Look at the railroad!  Did you forget the railroad?  It ain't many months

till spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad swimming

right along behind it.  Where'll it be by the middle of summer?  Just

stop and fancy a moment--just think a little--don't anything suggest

itself?  Bless your heart, you dear women live right in the present all

the time--but a man, why a man lives----



"In the future, Beriah?  But don't we live in the future most too much,

Beriah?  We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year's crop of corn

and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,

but sometimes it's not a robust diet,--Beriah.  But don't look that way,

dear--don't mind what I say.  I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to

worry; and I don't, once a month, do I, dear?  But when I get a little

low and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don't mean

anything in the world.  It passes right away.  I know you're doing all

you can, and I don't want to seem repining and ungrateful--for I'm not,

Beriah--you know I'm not, don't you?"



"Lord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that

ever lived--that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth!  And I know

that I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and scheme

for you with all my might.  And I'll bring things all right yet, honey--

cheer up and don't you fear.  The railroad----"



"Oh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a

body forgets everything.  Yes, the railroad--tell me about the railroad."



"Aha, my girl, don't you see?  Things ain't so dark, are they?  Now I

didn't forget the railroad.  Now just think for a moment--just figure up

a little on the future dead moral certainties.  For instance, call this

waiter St. Louis.



"And we'll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to

this potato, which is Slouchburg:



"Then with this carving knife we'll continue the railroad from Slouchburg

to Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:



"Then we run along the--yes--the comb--to the tumbler that's Brimstone:



"Thence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is the salt-cellar:



"Thence to, to--that quill--Catfish--hand me the pincushion, Marie

Antoinette:



"Thence right along these shears to this horse, Babylon:



"Then by the spoon to Bloody Run--thank you, the ink:



"Thence to Hail Columbia--snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and

saucer close up, that's Hail Columbia:



"Then--let me open my knife--to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we'll put the

candle-stick--only a little distance from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the-

Tomb--down-grade all the way.



"And there we strike Columbus River--pass me two or throe skeins of

thread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and

the rat trap for Stone's Landing-Napoleon, I mean--and you can see how

much better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye.  Now here you are with your

railroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and thence

to Corruptionville.



"Now then-them you are!  It's a beautiful road, beautiful.  Jeff Thompson

can out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through an aneroid,

or a theodolite, or whatever they call it--he calls it sometimes one and

sometimes the other just whichever levels off his sentence neatest, I

reckon.  But ain't it a ripping toad, though?  I tell you, it'll make a

stir when it gets along.  Just see what a country it goes through.

There's your onions at Slouchburg--noblest onion country that graces

God's footstool; and there's your turnip country all around Doodleville--

bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there when they get

that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of turnips--if

there's any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress has made an

appropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn't have done

that just on conjecture, of course.  And now we come to the Brimstone

region--cattle raised there till you can't rest--and corn, and all that

sort of thing.  Then you've got a little stretch along through Belshazzar

that don't produce anything now--at least nothing but rocks--but

irrigation will fetch it.  Then from Catfish to Babylon it's a little

swampy, but there's dead loads of peat down under there somewhere.  Next

is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country--tobacco enough can be raised

there to support two such railroads.  Next is the sassparilla region.

I reckon there's enough of that truck along in there on the line of the

pocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the Tomb to fat up all the

consumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax to the Holy Land.  It just

grows like weeds!  I've got a little belt of sassparilla land in there

just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my little Universal

Expectorant to get into shape in my head.  And I'll fix that, you know.

One of these days I'll have all the nations of the earth expecto--"



"But Beriah, dear--"



"Don't interrupt me; Polly--I don't want you to lose the run of the map--

well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have it--and run

along with you.  Here, now--the soap will do for Babylon.  Let me see--

where was I?  Oh yes--now we run down to Stone's Lan--Napoleon--now we

run down to Napoleon.  Beautiful road.  Look at that, now.  Perfectly

straight line-straight as the way to the grave.  And see where it leaves

Hawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear out in the cold.  That

town's as bound to die as--well if I owned it I'd get its obituary ready,

now, and notify the mourners.  Polly, mark my words--in three years from

this, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness.  You'll see.  And just look at

that river--noblest stream that meanders over the thirsty earth!--

calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her weary bosom!  Railroad goes

all over it and all through it--wades right along on stilts.  Seventeen

bridges in three miles and a half-forty-nine bridges from Hark-from-the-

Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether--forty nine bridges, and culverts

enough to culvert creation itself!  Hadn't skeins of thread enough to

represent them all--but you get an idea--perfect trestle-work of bridges

for seventy two miles: Jeff Thompson and I fixed all that, you know; he's

to get the contracts and I'm to put them through on the divide.  Just

oceans of money in those bridges.  It's the only part of the railroad I'm

interested in,--down along the line--and it's all I want, too.  It's

enough, I should judge. Now here we are at Napoleon.  Good enough country

plenty good enough--all it wants is population.  That's all right--that

will come.  And it's no bad country now for calmness and solitude, I can

tell you--though there's no money in that, of course.  No money, but a

man wants rest, a man wants peace--a man don't want to rip and tear

around all the time.  And here we go, now, just as straight as a string

for Hallelujah--it's a beautiful angle--handsome up grade all the way--

and then away you go to Corruptionville, the gaudiest country for early

carrots and cauliflowers that ever--good missionary field, too.  There

ain't such another missionary field outside the jungles of Central

Africa.  And patriotic?--why they named it after Congress itself.  Oh,

I warn you, my dear, there's a good time coming, and it'll be right along

before you know what you're about, too.  That railroad's fetching it.

You see what it is as far as I've got, and if I had enough bottles and

soap and boot-jacks and such things to carry it along to where it joins

onto the Union Pacific, fourteen hundred miles from here, I should

exhibit to you in that little internal improvement a spectacle of

inconceivable sublimity.  So, don't you see?  We've got the rail road to

fall back on; and in the meantime, what are we worrying about that

$200,000 appropriation for?  That's all right.  I'd be willing to bet

anything that the very next letter that comes from Harry will--"



The eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter,

warm from the post-office.



"Things do look bright, after all, Beriah.  I'm sorry I was blue, but it

did seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages.  Open

the letter--open it quick, and let's know all about it before we stir out

of our places.  I am all in a fidget to know what it says."



The letter was opened, without any unnecessary delay.









CHAPTER XXVIII.



Whatever may have been the language of Harry's letter to the Colonel,

the information it conveyed wars condensed or expanded, one or the other,

from the following episode of his visit to New York:



He called, with official importance in his mien, at No.--Wall street,

where a great gilt sign betokened the presence of the head-quarters of

the a Columbus River Slack-Water Navigation Company."  He entered and

gave a dressy porter his card, and was requested to wait a moment in a

sort of ante-room.  The porter returned in a minute; and asked whom he

would like to see?



"The president of the company, of course."



"He is busy with some gentlemen, sir; says he will be done with them

directly."



That a copper-plate card with "Engineer-in-Chief" on it should be

received with such tranquility as this, annoyed Mr. Brierly not a little.

But he had to submit.  Indeed his annoyance had time to augment a good

deal; for he was allowed to cool his heels a frill half hour in the ante-

room before those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the presence.

He found a stately dignitary occupying a very official chair behind a

long green morocco-covered table, in a room with sumptuously carpeted and

furnished, and well garnished with pictures.



"Good morning, sir; take a seat--take a seat."



"Thank you sir," said Harry, throwing as much chill into his manner as

his ruffled dignity prompted.



"We perceive by your reports and the reports of the Chief Superintendent,

that you have been making gratifying progress with the work.--We are all

very much pleased."



"Indeed?  We did not discover it from your letters--which we have not

received; nor by the treatment our drafts have met with--which were not

honored; nor by the reception of any part of the appropriation, no part

of it having come to hand."



"Why, my dear Mr. Brierly, there must be some mistake, I am sure we wrote

you and also Mr. Sellers, recently--when my clerk comes he will show

copies--letters informing you of the ten per cent. assessment."



"Oh, certainly, we got those letters.  But what we wanted was money to

carry on the work--money to pay the men."



"Certainly, certainly--true enough--but we credited you both for a large

part of your assessments--I am sure that was in our letters."



"Of course that was in--I remember that."



"Ah, very well then.  Now we begin to understand each other."



"Well, I don't see that we do.  There's two months' wages due the men,

and----"



"How?  Haven't you paid the men?"



"Paid them!  How are we going to pay them when you don't honor our

drafts?"



"Why, my dear sir, I cannot see how you can find any fault with us.  I am

sure we have acted in a perfectly straight forward business way.--Now let

us look at the thing a moment.  You subscribed for 100 shares of the

capital stock, at $1,000 a share, I believe?"



"Yes, sir, I did."



"And Mr. Sellers took a like amount?"



"Yes, sir."



"Very well.  No concern can get along without money.  We levied a ten per

cent. assessment.  It was the original understanding that you and Mr.

Sellers were to have the positions you now hold, with salaries of $600 a

month each, while in active service.  You were duly elected to these

places, and you accepted them.  Am I right?"



"Certainly."



"Very well.  You were given your instructions and put to work.  By your

reports it appears that you have expended the sum of $9,610 upon the said

work.  Two months salary to you two officers amounts altogether to

$2,400--about one-eighth of your ten per cent. assessment, you see; which

leaves you in debt to the company for the other seven-eighths of the

assessment--viz, something over $8,000 apiece.  Now instead of requiring

you to forward this aggregate of $16,000 or $17,000 to New York, the

company voted unanimously to let you pay it over to the contractors,

laborers from time to time, and give you credit on the books for it.

And they did it without a murmur, too, for they were pleased with the

progress you had made, and were glad to pay you that little compliment--

and a very neat one it was, too, I am sure.  The work you did fell short

of $10,000, a trifle.  Let me see--$9,640 from $20,000 salary $2;400

added--ah yes, the balance due the company from yourself and Mr. Sellers

is $7,960, which I will take the responsibility of allowing to stand for

the present, unless you prefer to draw a check now, and thus----"



"Confound it, do you mean to say that instead of the company owing us

$2,400, we owe the company $7,960?"



"Well, yes."



"And that we owe the men and the contractors nearly ten thousand dollars

besides?"



"Owe them!  Oh bless my soul, you can't mean that you have not paid these

people?"



"But I do mean it!"



The president rose and walked the floor like a man in bodily pain.  His

brows contracted, he put his hand up and clasped his forehead, and kept

saying, "Oh, it is, too bad, too bad, too bad!  Oh, it is bound to be

found out--nothing can prevent it--nothing!"



Then he threw himself into his chair and said:



"My dear Mr. Brierson, this is dreadful--perfectly dreadful.  It will be

found out.  It is bound to tarnish the good name of the company; our

credit will be seriously, most seriously impaired.  How could you be so

thoughtless--the men ought to have been paid though it beggared us all!"



"They ought, ought they?  Then why the devil--my name is not Bryerson, by

the way--why the mischief didn't the compa--why what in the nation ever

became of the appropriation?  Where is that appropriation?--if a

stockholder may make so bold as to ask."



The appropriation?--that paltry $200,000, do you mean?"



"Of course--but I didn't know that $200,000 was so very paltry.  Though I

grant, of course, that it is not a large sum, strictly speaking.  But

where is it?"



"My dear sir, you surprise me.  You surely cannot have had a large

acquaintance with this sort of thing.  Otherwise you would not have

expected much of a result from a mere INITIAL appropriation like that.

It was never intended for anything but a mere nest egg for the future and

real appropriations to cluster around."



"Indeed?  Well, was it a myth, or was it a reality?  Whatever become of

it?"



"Why the--matter is simple enough.  A Congressional appropriation costs

money.  Just reflect, for instance--a majority of the House Committee,

say $10,000 apiece--$40,000; a majority of the Senate Committee, the same

each--say $40,000; a little extra to one or two chairman of one or two

such committees, say $10,000 each--$20,000; and there's $100,000 of the

money gone, to begin with.  Then, seven male lobbyists, at $3,000 each--

$21,000; one female lobbyist, $10,000; a high moral Congressman or

Senator here and there--the high moral ones cost more, because they.

give tone to a measure--say ten of these at $3,000 each, is $30,000; then

a lot of small-fry country members who won't vote for anything whatever

without pay--say twenty at $500 apiece, is $10,000; a lot of dinners to

members--say $10,000 altogether; lot of jimcracks for Congressmen's wives

and children--those go a long way--you can't sped too much money in that

line--well, those things cost in a lump, say $10,000--along there

somewhere; and then comes your printed documents--your maps, your tinted

engravings, your pamphlets, your illuminated show cards, your

advertisements in a hundred and fifty papers at ever so much a line--

because you've got to keep the papers all light or you are gone up, you

know.  Oh, my dear sir, printing bills are destruction itself.  Ours so

far amount to--let me see--10; 52; 22; 13;--and then there's 11; 14; 33--

well, never mind the details, the total in clean numbers foots up

$118,254.42 thus far!"



"What!"



"Oh, yes indeed.  Printing's no bagatelle, I can tell you.  And then

there's your contributions, as a company, to Chicago fires and Boston

fires, and orphan asylums and all that sort of thing--head the list, you

see, with the company's full name and a thousand dollars set opposite--

great card, sir--one of the finest advertisements in the world--the

preachers mention it in the pulpit when it's a religious charity--one of

the happiest advertisements in the world is your benevolent donation.

Ours have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and some cents up to this

time."



"Good heavens!"



"Oh, yes.  Perhaps the biggest thing we've done in the advertising line

was to get an officer of the U. S. government, of perfectly Himmalayan

official altitude, to write up our little internal improvement for a

religious paper of enormous circulation--I tell you that makes our bonds

go handsomely among the pious poor.  Your religious paper is by far the

best vehicle for a thing of this kind, because they'll 'lead' your

article and put it right in the midst of the reading matter; and if it's

got a few Scripture quotations in it, and some temperance platitudes and

a bit of gush here and there about Sunday Schools, and a sentimental

snuffle now and then about 'God's precious ones, the honest hard-handed

poor,' it works the nation like a charm, my dear sir, and never a man

suspects that it is an advertisement; but your secular paper sticks you

right into the advertising columns and of course you don't take a trick.

Give me a religious paper to advertise in, every time; and if you'll just

look at their advertising pages, you'll observe that other people think a

good deal as I do--especially people who have got little financial

schemes to make everybody rich with.  Of course I mean your great big

metropolitan religious papers that know how to serve God and make money

at the same time--that's your sort, sir, that's your sort--a religious

paper that isn't run to make money is no use to us, sir, as an

advertising medium--no use to anybody--in our line of business.  I guess

our next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters

out to Napoleon.  Never paid them a cent; just filled them up with

champagne and the fat of the land, put pen, ink and paper before them

while they were red-hot, and bless your soul when you come to read their

letters you'd have supposed they'd been to heaven.  And if a sentimental

squeamishness held one or two of them back from taking a less rosy view

of Napoleon, our hospitalities tied his tongue, at least, and he said

nothing at all and so did us no harm.  Let me see--have I stated all the

expenses I've been at?  No, I was near forgetting one or two items.

There's your official salaries--you can't get good men for nothing.

Salaries cost pretty lively.  And then there's your big high-sounding

millionaire names stuck into your advertisements as stockholders--another

card, that--and they are stockholders, too, but you have to give them the

stock and non-assessable at that--so they're an expensive lot.  Very,

very expensive thing, take it all around, is a big internal improvement

concern--but you see that yourself, Mr. Bryerman--you see that, yourself,

sir."



"But look here.  I think you are a little mistaken about it's ever having

cost anything for Congressional votes.  I happen to know something about

that.  I've let you say your say--now let me say mine.  I don't wish to

seem to throw any suspicion on anybody's statements, because we are all

liable to be mistaken.  But how would it strike you if I were to say that

I was in Washington all the time this bill was pending? and what if I

added that I put the measure through myself?  Yes, sir, I did that little

thing.  And moreover, I never paid a dollar for any man's vote and never

promised one.  There are some ways of doing a thing that are as good as

others which other people don't happen to think about, or don't have the

knack of succeeding in, if they do happen to think of them.  My dear sir,

I am obliged to knock some of your expenses in the head--for never a cent

was paid a Congressman or Senator on the part of this Navigation Company."



The president smiled blandly, even sweetly, all through this harangue,

and then said:



"Is that so?"



"Every word of it."



"Well it does seem to alter the complexion of things a little.  You are

acquainted with the members down there, of course, else you could not

have worked to such advantage?"



"I know them all, sir.  I know their wives, their children, their babies

--I even made it a point to be on good terms with their lackeys.  I know

every Congressman well--even familiarly."



"Very good.  Do you know any of their signatures?  Do you know their

handwriting?"



"Why I know their handwriting as well as I know my own--have had

correspondence enough with them, I should think.  And their signatures--

why I can tell their initials, even."



The president went to a private safe, unlocked it and got out some

letters and certain slips of paper.  Then he said:



"Now here, for instance; do you believe that that is a genuine letter?

Do you know this signature here?--and this one?  Do you know who those

initials represent--and are they forgeries?"



Harry was stupefied.  There were things there that made his brain swim.

Presently, at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that

restored his equilibrium; it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his

face.



The president said:



"That one amuses you.  You never suspected him?"



"Of course I ought to have suspected him, but I don't believe it ever

really occurred to me.  Well, well, well--how did you ever have the nerve

to approach him, of all others?"



"Why my friend, we never think of accomplishing anything without his

help.  He is our mainstay.  But how do those letters strike you?"



"They strike me dumb!  What a stone-blind idiot I have been!"



"Well, take it all around, I suppose you had a pleasant time in

Washington," said the president, gathering up the letters; "of course you

must have had.  Very few men could go there and get a money bill through

without buying a single"



"Come, now, Mr. President, that's plenty of that!  I take back everything

I said on that head.  I'm a wiser man to-day than I was yesterday, I can

tell you."



"I think you are.  In fact I am satisfied you are.  But now I showed you

these things in confidence, you understand.  Mention facts as much as you

want to, but don't mention names to anybody.  I can depend on you for

that, can't I?"



"Oh, of course.  I understand the necessity of that.  I will not betray

the names.  But to go back a bit, it begins to look as if you never saw

any of that appropriation at all?"



"We saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it--and that was all.  Several of

us took turns at log-rolling in Washington, and if we had charged

anything for that service, none of that $10,000 would ever have reached

New York."



"If you hadn't levied the assessment you would have been in a close place

I judge?"



"Close?  Have you figured up the total of the disbursements I told you

of?"



"No, I didn't think of that."



"Well, lets see:



Spent in Washington, say, ........... $191,000

Printing, advertising, etc., say .... $118,000

Charity, say, .......................  $16,000



               Total, ............... $325,000



The money to do that with, comes from--

Appropriation, ...................... $200,000



Ten per cent. assessment on capital of

     $1,000,000 ..................... $100,000



               Total, ............... $300,000



"Which leaves us in debt some $25,000 at this moment.  Salaries of home

officers are still going on; also printing and advertising.  Next month

will show a state of things!"



"And then--burst up, I suppose?"



"By no means.  Levy another assessment"



"Oh, I see.  That's dismal."



"By no means."



"Why isn't it?  What's the road out?"



"Another appropriation, don't you see?"



"Bother the appropriations.  They cost more than they come to."



"Not the next one.  We'll call for half a million--get it and go for a

million the very next month."--"Yes, but the cost of it!"



The president smiled, and patted his secret letters affectionately.  He

said:



"All these people are in the next Congress.  We shan't have to pay them a

cent.  And what is more, they will work like beavers for us--perhaps it

might be to their advantage."



Harry reflected profoundly a while.  Then he said:



"We send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other lands.

How much cheaper and better it would be if those people could only come

here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head."



"I perfectly agree with yon, Mr. Beverly.  Must you go?  Well, good

morning.  Look in, when you are passing; and whenever I can give you any

information about our affairs and pro'spects, I shall be glad to do it."



Harry's letter was not a long one, but it contained at least the

calamitous figures that came out in the above conversation.  The Colonel

found himself in a rather uncomfortable place--no $1,200 salary

forthcoming; and himself held responsible for half of the $9,640 due the

workmen, to say nothing of being in debt to the company to the extent of

nearly $4,000.  Polly's heart was nearly broken; the "blues" returned in

fearful force, and she had to go out of the room to hide the tears that

nothing could keep back now.



There was mourning in another quarter, too, for Louise had a letter.

Washington had refused, at the last moment, to take $40,000 for the

Tennessee Land, and had demanded $150,000!  So the trade fell through,

and now Washington was wailing because he had been so foolish.  But he

wrote that his man might probably return to the city soon, and then he

meant to sell to him, sure, even if he had to take $10,000.  Louise had a

good cry-several of them, indeed--and the family charitably forebore to

make any comments that would increase her grief.



Spring blossomed, summer came, dragged its hot weeks by, and the

Colonel's spirits rose, day by day, for the railroad was making good

progress.  But by and by something happened.  Hawkeye had always declined

to subscribe anything toward the railway, imagining that her large

business would be a sufficient compulsory influence; but now Hawkeye was

frightened; and before Col. Sellers knew what he was about, Hawkeye, in a

panic, had rushed to the front and subscribed such a sum that Napoleon's

attractions suddenly sank into insignificance and the railroad concluded

to follow a comparatively straight coarse instead of going miles out of

its way to build up a metropolis in the muddy desert of Stone's Landing.



The thunderbolt fell.  After all the Colonel's deep planning; after all

his brain work and tongue work in drawing public attention to his pet

project and enlisting interest in it; after all his faithful hard toil

with his hands, and running hither and thither on his busy feet; after

all his high hopes and splendid prophecies, the fates had turned their

backs on him at last, and all in a moment his air-castles crumbled to

ruins abort him.  Hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing,

and down went Stone's Landing!  One by one its meagre parcel of

inhabitants packed up and moved away, as the summer waned and fall

approached.  Town lots were no longer salable, traffic ceased, a deadly

lethargy fell upon the place once more, the "Weekly Telegraph" faded into

an early grave, the wary tadpole returned from exile, the bullfrog

resumed his ancient song, the tranquil turtle sunned his back upon bank

and log and drowsed his grateful life away as in the old sweet days of

yore.









CHAPTER XXIX.



Philip Sterling was on his way to Ilium, in the state of Pennsylvania.

Ilium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild land which

Mr. Bolton had commissioned him to examine.



On the last day of the journey as the railway train Philip was on was

leaving a large city, a lady timidly entered the drawing-room car, and

hesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied.  Philip saw

from the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was

starting.  In a few moments the conductor entered, and without waiting an

explanation, said roughly to the lady,



"Now you can't sit there.  That seat's taken.  Go into the other car."



"I did not intend to take the seat," said the lady rising, "I only sat

down a moment till the conductor should come and give me a seat."



"There aint any.  Car's full.  You'll have to leave."



"But, sir," said the lady, appealingly, "I thought--"



"Can't help what you thought--you must go into the other car."



"The train is going very fast, let me stand here till we stop."



"The lady can have my seat," cried Philip, springing up.



The conductor turned towards Philip, and coolly and deliberately surveyed

him from head to foot, with contempt in every line of his face, turned

his back upon him without a word, and said to the lady,



"Come, I've got no time to talk.  You must go now."



The lady, entirely disconcerted by such rudeness, and frightened, moved

towards the door, opened it and stepped out.  The train was swinging

along at a rapid rate, jarring from side to side; the step was a long one

between the cars and there was no protecting grating.  The lady attempted

it, but lost her balance, in the wind and the motion of the car, and

fell!  She would inevitably have gone down under the wheels, if Philip,

who had swiftly followed her, had not caught her arm and drawn her up.

He then assisted her across, found her a seat, received her bewildered

thanks, and returned to his car.



The conductor was still there, taking his tickets, and growling something

about imposition.  Philip marched up to him, and burst out with,



"You are a brute, an infernal brute, to treat a woman that way."



"Perhaps you'd like to make a fuss about it," sneered the conductor.



Philip's reply was a blow, given so suddenly and planted so squarely in

the conductor's face, that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger, who

was looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute with a

conductor, and against the side of the car.



He recovered himself, reached the bell rope, "Damn you, I'll learn you,"

stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen, and then, as the

speed slackened; roared out,



"Get off this train."



"I shall not get off.  I have as much right here as you."



"We'll see," said the conductor, advancing with the brakemen.  The

passengers protested, and some of them said to each other, "That's too

bad," as they always do in such cases, but none of them offered to take a

hand with Philip.  The men seized him, wrenched him from his seat,

dragged him along the aisle, tearing his clothes, thrust him from the

car, and, then flung his carpet-bag, overcoat and umbrella after him.

And the train went on.



The conductor, red in the face and puffing from his exertion, swaggered

through the car, muttering "Puppy, I'll learn him."  The passengers, when

he had gone, were loud in their indignation, and talked about signing a

protest, but they did nothing more than talk.



The next morning the Hooverville Patriot and Clarion had this "item":--





                          SLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD.



     "We learn that as the down noon express was leaving H---- yesterday

     a lady! (God save the mark) attempted to force herself into the

     already full palatial car.  Conductor Slum, who is too old a bird to

     be caught with chaff, courteously informed her that the car was

     full, and when she insisted on remaining, he persuaded her to go

     into the car where she belonged.  Thereupon a young sprig, from the

     East, blustered like a Shanghai rooster, and began to sass the

     conductor with his chin music.  That gentleman delivered the young

     aspirant for a muss one of his elegant little left-handers, which so

     astonished him that he began to feel for his shooter.  Whereupon Mr.

     Slum gently raised the youth, carried him forth, and set him down

     just outside the car to cool off.  Whether the young blood has yet

     made his way out of Bascom's swamp, we have not learned.  Conductor

     Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and efficient officers on the

     road; but he ain't trifled with, not much.  We learn that the

     company have put a new engine on the seven o'clock train, and newly

     upholstered the drawing-room car throughout.  It spares no effort

     for the comfort of the traveling public."



Philip never had been before in Bascom's swamp, and there was nothing

inviting in it to detain him.  After the train got out of the way he

crawled out of the briars and the mud, and got upon the track.  He was

somewhat bruised, but he was too angry to mind that.  He plodded along

over the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body.  In the scuffle,

his railway check had disappeared, and he grimly wondered, as he noticed

the loss, if the company would permit him to walk over their track if

they should know he hadn't a ticket.



Philip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little station,

where he could wait for a train, and he had ample time for reflection.

At first he was full of vengeance on the company.  He would sue it.  He

would make it pay roundly.  But then it occurred to him that he did not

know the name of a witness he could summon, and that a personal fight

against a railway corporation was about the most hopeless in the world.

He then thought he would seek out that conductor, lie in wait for him at

some station, and thrash him, or get thrashed himself.



But as he got cooler, that did not seem to him a project worthy of a

gentleman exactly.  Was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such

a fellow as that conductor on the letter's own plane?  And when he came

to this point, he began to ask himself, if he had not acted very much

like a fool.  He didn't regret striking the fellow--he hoped he had left

a mark on him.  But, after all, was that the best way?  Here was he,

Philip Sterling, calling himself a gentleman, in a brawl with a vulgar

conductor, about a woman he had never seen before.  Why should he have

put himself in such a ridiculous position?  Wasn't it enough to have

offered the lady his seat, to have rescued her from an accident, perhaps

from death?  Suppose he had simply said to the conductor, "Sir, your

conduct is brutal, I shall report you."  The passengers, who saw the

affair, might have joined in a report against the conductor, and he might

really have accomplished something.  And, now!  Philip looked at leis

torn clothes, and thought with disgust of his haste in getting into a

fight with such an autocrat.



At the little station where Philip waited for the next train, he met a

man--who turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood,

and told him his adventure.  He was a kindly sort of man, and seemed very

much interested.



"Dum 'em," said he, when he had heard the story.



"Do you think any thing can be done, sir?"



"Wal, I guess tain't no use.  I hain't a mite of doubt of every word you

say.  But suin's no use.  The railroad company owns all these people

along here, and the judges on the bench too.  Spiled your clothes!  Wal,

'least said's soonest mended.'  You haint no chance with the company."



When next morning, he read the humorous account in the Patriot and

Clarion, he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before

the public in a fight with the railroad company.



Still Philip's conscience told him that it was his plain duty to carry

the matter into the courts, even with the certainty of defeat.

He confessed that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his

own feelings or conscience in a case where a law of the land had been

violated before his own eyes.  He confessed that every citizen's first

duty in such case is to put aside his own business and devote his time

and his best efforts to seeing that the infraction is promptly punished;

and he knew that no country can be well governed unless its citizens as

a body keep religiously before their minds that they are the guardians

of the law, and that the law officers are only the machinery for its

execution, nothing more.  As a finality he was obliged to confess that he

was a bad citizen, and also that the general laxity of the time, and the

absence of a sense of duty toward any part of the community but the

individual himself were ingrained in him, am he was no better than the

rest of the people.



The result of this little adventure was that Philip did not reach Ilium

till daylight the next morning, when he descended sleepy and sore, from a

way train, and looked about him.  Ilium was in a narrow mountain gorge,

through which a rapid stream ran.  It consisted of the plank platform on

which he stood, a wooden house, half painted, with a dirty piazza

(unroofed) in front, and a sign board hung on a slanting pole--bearing

the legend, "Hotel. P. Dusenheimer," a sawmill further down the stream,

a blacksmith-shop, and a store, and three or four unpainted dwellings of

the slab variety.



As Philip approached the hotel he saw what appeared to be a wild beast

crouching on the piazza.  It did not stir, however, and he soon found

that it was only a stuffed skin.  This cheerful invitation to the tavern

was the remains of a huge panther which had been killed in the region a

few weeks before.  Philip examined his ugly visage and strong crooked

fore-arm, as he was waiting admittance, having pounded upon the door.



"Yait a bit.  I'll shoost--put on my trowsers," shouted a voice from the

window, and the door was soon opened by the yawning landlord.



"Morgen!  Didn't hear d' drain oncet.  Dem boys geeps me up zo spate.

Gom right in."



Philip was shown into a dirty bar-room.  It was a small room, with a

stove in the middle, set in a long shallow box of sand, for the benefit

of the "spitters," a bar across one end--a mere counter with a sliding

glass-case behind it containing a few bottles having ambitious labels,

and a wash-sink in one corner.  On the walls were the bright yellow and

black handbills of a traveling circus, with pictures of acrobats in human

pyramids, horses flying in long leaps through the air, and sylph-like

women in a paradisaic costume, balancing themselves upon the tips of

their toes on the bare backs of frantic and plunging steeds, and kissing

their hands to the spectators meanwhile.



As Philip did not desire a room at that hour, he was invited to wash

himself at the nasty sink, a feat somewhat easier than drying his face,

for the towel that hung in a roller over the sink was evidently as much a

fixture as the sink itself, and belonged, like the suspended brush and

comb, to the traveling public.  Philip managed to complete his toilet by

the use of his pocket-handkerchief, and declining the hospitality of the

landlord, implied in the remark, "You won'd dake notin'?" he went into

the open air to wait for breakfast.



The country he saw was wild but not picturesque.  The mountain before him

might be eight hundred feet high, and was only a portion of a long

unbroken range, savagely wooded, which followed the stream.  Behind the

hotel, and across the brawling brook, was another level-topped, wooded

range exactly like it.  Ilium itself, seen at a glance, was old enough to

be dilapidated, and if it had gained anything by being made a wood and

water station of the new railroad, it was only a new sort of grime and

rawness.  P. Dusenheimer, standing in the door of his uninviting

groggery, when the trains stopped for water; never received from the

traveling public any patronage except facetious remarks upon his personal

appearance.  Perhaps a thousand times he had heard the remark, "Ilium

fuit," followed in most instances by a hail to himself as "AEneas," with

the inquiry "Where is old Anchises?  "At first he had replied, "Dere

ain't no such man;" but irritated by its senseless repetition, he had

latterly dropped into the formula of, "You be dam."



Philip was recalled from the contemplation of Ilium by the rolling and

growling of the gong within the hotel, the din and clamor increasing till

the house was apparently unable to contain it; when it burst out of the

front door and informed the world that breakfast was on the table.



The dining room was long, low and narrow, and a narrow table extended its

whole length.  Upon this was spread a cloth which from appearance might

have been as long in use as the towel in the barroom.  Upon the table was

the usual service, the heavy, much nicked stone ware, the row of plated

and rusty castors, the sugar bowls with the zinc tea-spoons sticking up

in them, the piles of yellow biscuits, the discouraged-looking plates of

butter.  The landlord waited, and Philip was pleased to observe the

change in his manner.  In the barroom he was the conciliatory landlord.

Standing behind his guests at table, he had an air of peremptory

patronage, and the voice in which he shot out the inquiry, as he seized

Philip's plate, "Beefsteak or liver?" quite took away Philip's power of

choice.  He begged for a glass of milk, after trying that green hued

compound called coffee, and made his breakfast out of that and some hard

crackers which seemed to have been imported into Ilium before the

introduction of the iron horse, and to have withstood a ten years siege

of regular boarders, Greeks and others.



The land that Philip had come to look at was at least five miles distant

from Ilium station.  A corner of it touched the railroad, but the rest

was pretty much an unbroken wilderness, eight or ten thousand acres of

rough country, most of it such a mountain range as he saw at Ilium.



His first step was to hire three woodsmen to accompany him.  By their

help he built a log hut, and established a camp on the land, and then

began his explorations, mapping down his survey as he went along, noting

the timber, and the lay of the land, and making superficial observations

as to the prospect of coal.



The landlord at Ilium endeavored to persuade Philip to hire the services

of a witch-hazel professor of that region, who could walk over the land

with his wand and tell him infallibly whether it contained coal, and

exactly where the strata ran.  But Philip preferred to trust to his own

study of the country, and his knowledge of the geological formation.

He spent a month in traveling over the land and making calculations;

and made up his mind that a fine vein of coal ran through the mountain

about a mile from the railroad, and that the place to run in a tunnel was

half way towards its summit.



Acting with his usual promptness, Philip, with the consent of Mr. Bolton,

broke ground there at once, and, before snow came, had some rude

buildings up, and was ready for active operations in the spring.  It was

true that there were no outcroppings of coal at the place, and the people

at Ilium said he "mought as well dig for plug terbaccer there;" but

Philip had great faith in the uniformity of nature's operations in ages

past, and he had no doubt that he should strike at this spot the rich

vein that had made the fortune of the Golden Briar Company.









CHAPTER XXX.



Once more Louise had good news from her Washington--Senator Dilworthy was

going to sell the Tennessee Land to the government!  Louise told Laura in

confidence.  She had told her parents, too, and also several bosom

friends; but all of these people had simply looked sad when they heard

the news, except Laura.  Laura's face suddenly brightened under it--only

for an instant, it is true, but poor Louise was grateful for even that

fleeting ray of encouragement.  When next Laura was alone, she fell into

a train of thought something like this:



If the Senator has really taken hold of this matter, I may look for that

invitation to his house at, any moment.  I am perishing to go!  I do long

to know whether I am only simply a large-sized pigmy among these pigmies

here, who tumble over so easily when one strikes them, or whether I am

really--."  Her thoughts drifted into other channels, for a season.

"Then she continued:--"He said I could be useful in the great cause of

philanthropy, and help in the blessed work of uplifting the poor and the

ignorant, if he found it feasible to take hold of our Land.  Well, that

is neither here nor there; what I want, is to go to Washington and find

out what I am.  I want money, too; and if one may judge by what she

hears, there are chances there for a--."  For a fascinating woman, she

was going to say, perhaps, but she did not.



Along in the fall the invitation came, sure enough.  It came officially

through brother Washington, the private Secretary, who appended a

postscript that was brimming with delight over the prospect of seeing the

Duchess again.  He said it would be happiness enough to look upon her

face once more--it would be almost too much happiness when to it was

added the fact that she would bring messages with her that were fresh

from Louise's lips.



In Washington's letter were several important enclosures.  For instance,

there was the Senator's check for $2,000--"to buy suitable clothing in

New York with!"  It was a loan to be refunded when the Land was sold.

Two thousand--this was fine indeed.  Louise's father was called rich, but

Laura doubted if Louise had ever had $400 worth of new clothing at one

time in her life.  With the check came two through tickets--good on the

railroad from Hawkeye to Washington via New York--and they were "dead-

head" tickets, too, which had beep given to Senator Dilworthy by the

railway companies.  Senators and representatives were paid thousands of

dollars by the government for traveling expenses, but they always

traveled "deadhead" both ways, and then did as any honorable, high-minded

men would naturally do--declined to receive the mileage tendered them by

the government.  The Senator had plenty of railway passes, and could.

easily spare two to Laura--one for herself and one for a male escort.

Washington suggested that she get some old friend of the family to come

with her, and said the Senator would "deadhead" him home again as soon as

he had grown tired, of the sights of the capital.  Laura thought the

thing over.  At first she was pleased with the idea, but presently she

began to feel differently about it.  Finally she said, "No, our staid,

steady-going Hawkeye friends' notions and mine differ about some things--

they respect me, now, and I respect them--better leave it so--I will go

alone; I am not afraid to travel by myself."  And so communing with

herself, she left the house for an afternoon walk.



Almost at the door she met Col. Sellers.  She told him about her

invitation to Washington.



"Bless me!" said the Colonel.  "I have about made up my mind to go there

myself.  You see we've got to get another appropriation through, and the

Company want me to come east and put it through Congress.  Harry's there,

and he'll do what he can, of course; and Harry's a good fellow and always

does the very best he knows how, but then he's young--rather young for

some parts of such work, you know--and besides he talks too much, talks a

good deal too much; and sometimes he appears to be a little bit

visionary, too, I think the worst thing in the world for a business man.

A man like that always exposes his cards, sooner or later.  This sort of

thing wants an old, quiet, steady hand--wants an old cool head, you know,

that knows men, through and through, and is used to large operations.

I'm expecting my salary, and also some dividends from the company, and if

they get along in time, I'll go along with you Laura--take you under my

wing--you mustn't travel alone.  Lord I wish I had the money right now.

--But there'll be plenty soon--plenty."



Laura reasoned with herself that if the kindly, simple-hearted Colonel

was going anyhow, what could she gain by traveling alone and throwing

away his company?  So she told him she accepted his offer gladly,

gratefully.  She said it would be the greatest of favors if he would go

with her and protect her--not at his own expense as far as railway fares

were concerned, of course; she could not expect him to put himself to so

much trouble for her and pay his fare besides.  But he wouldn't hear of

her paying his fare--it would be only a pleasure to him to serve her.

Laura insisted on furnishing the tickets; and finally, when argument

failed, she said the tickets cost neither her nor any one else a cent--

she had two of them--she needed but one--and if he would not take the

other she would not go with him.  That settled the matter.  He took the

ticket.  Laura was glad that she had the check for new clothing, for she

felt very certain of being able to get the Colonel to borrow a little of

the money to pay hotel bills with, here and there.



She wrote Washington to look for her and Col. Sellers toward the end of

November; and at about the time set the two travelers arrived safe in the

capital of the nation, sure enough.









CHAPTER XXXL





               She the, gracious lady, yet no paines did spare

               To doe him ease, or doe him remedy:

               Many restoratives of vertues rare

               And costly cordialles she did apply,

               To mitigate his stubborne malady.

                                        Spenser's Faerie Queens.



Mr. Henry Brierly was exceedingly busy in New York, so he wrote Col.

Sellers, but he would drop everything and go to Washington.



The Colonel believed that Harry was the prince of lobbyists, a little too

sanguine, may be, and given to speculation, but, then, he knew everybody;

the Columbus River navigation scheme was, got through almost entirely by

his aid.  He was needed now to help through another scheme, a benevolent

scheme in which Col. Sellers, through the Hawkinses, had a deep interest.



"I don't care, you know," he wrote to Harry, "so much about the niggroes.

But if the government will buy this land, it will set up the Hawkins

family--make Laura an heiress--and I shouldn't wonder if Beriah Sellers

would set up his carriage again.  Dilworthy looks at it different,

of course.  He's all for philanthropy, for benefiting the colored race.

There's old Balsam, was in the Interior--used to be the Rev. Orson Balsam

of Iowa--he's made the riffle on the Injun; great Injun pacificator and

land dealer.  Balaam'a got the Injun to himself, and I suppose that

Senator Dilworthy feels that there is nothing left him but the colored

man.  I do rechon he is the best friend the colored man has got in

Washington."



Though Harry was in a hurry to reach Washington, he stopped in

Philadelphia; and prolonged his visit day after day, greatly to the

detriment of his business both in New York and Washington.  The society

at the Bolton's might have been a valid excuse for neglecting business

much more important than his.  Philip was there; he was a partner with

Mr. Bolton now in the new coal venture, concerning which there was much

to be arranged in preparation for the Spring work, and Philip lingered

week after week in the hospitable house.  Alice was making a winter

visit.  Ruth only went to town twice a week to attend lectures, and the

household was quite to Mr. Bolton's taste, for he liked the cheer of

company and something going on evenings.  Harry was cordially asked to

bring his traveling-bag there, and he did not need urging to do so.

Not even the thought of seeing Laura at the capital made him restless in

the society of the two young ladies; two birds in hand are worth one in

the bush certainly.



Philip was at home--he sometimes wished he were not so much so.  He felt

that too much or not enough was taken for granted.  Ruth had met him,

when he first came, with a cordial frankness, and her manner continued

entirely unrestrained.  She neither sought his company nor avoided it,

and this perfectly level treatment irritated him more than any other

could have done.  It was impossible to advance much in love-making with

one who offered no obstacles, had no concealments and no embarrassments,

and whom any approach to sentimentality would be quite likely to set into

a fit of laughter.



"Why, Phil," she would say, "what puts you in the dumps to day?  You are

as solemn as the upper bench in Meeting.  I shall have to call Alice to

raise your spirits; my presence seems to depress you."



It's not your presence, but your absence when you are present," began

Philip, dolefully, with the idea that he was saying a rather deep thing.

"But you won't understand me."



"No, I confess I cannot.  If you really are so low, as to think I am

absent when I am present, it's a frightful case of aberration; I shall

ask father to bring out Dr. Jackson.  Does Alice appear to be present

when she is absent?"



"Alice has some human feeling, anyway.  She cares for something besides

musty books and dry bones.  I think, Ruth, when I die," said Philip,

intending to be very grim and sarcastic, "I'll leave you my skeleton.

You might like that."



"It might be more cheerful than you are at times," Ruth replied with a

laugh.  "But you mustn't do it without consulting Alice.  She might not.

like it."



"I don't know why you should bring Alice up on every occasion.  Do you

think I am in love with her?"



"Bless you, no.  It never entered my head.  Are you?  The thought of

Philip Sterling in love is too comical.  I thought you were only in love

with the Ilium coal mine, which you and father talk about half the time."



This is a specimen of Philip's wooing.  Confound the girl, he would say

to himself, why does she never tease Harry and that young Shepley who

comes here?



How differently Alice treated him.  She at least never mocked him, and it

was a relief to talk with one who had some sympathy with him.  And he did

talk to her, by the hour, about Ruth.  The blundering fellow poured all

his doubts and anxieties into her ear, as if she had been the impassive

occupant of one of those little wooden confessionals in the Cathedral on

Logan Square.  Has, a confessor, if she is young and pretty, any feeling?

Does it mend the matter by calling her your sister?



Philip called Alice his good sister, and talked to her about love and

marriage, meaning Ruth, as if sisters could by no possibility have any

personal concern in such things.  Did Ruth ever speak of him?  Did she

think Ruth cared for him?  Did Ruth care for anybody at Fallkill?  Did

she care for anything except her profession?  And so on.



Alice was loyal to Ruth, and if she knew anything she did not betray her

friend.  She did not, at any rate, give Philip too much encouragement.

What woman, under the circumstances, would?



"I can tell you one thing, Philip," she said, "if ever Ruth Bolton loves,

it will be with her whole soul, in a depth of passion that will sweep

everything before it and surprise even herself."



A remark that did not much console Philip, who imagined that only some

grand heroism could unlock the sweetness of such a heart; and Philip

feared that he wasn't a hero.  He did not know out of what materials a

woman can construct a hero, when she is in the creative mood.



Harry skipped into this society with his usual lightness and gaiety.

His good nature was inexhaustible, and though he liked to relate his own

exploits, he had a little tact in adapting himself to the tastes of his

hearers.  He was not long in finding out that Alice liked to hear about

Philip, and Harry launched out into the career of his friend in the West,

with a prodigality of invention that would have astonished the chief

actor.  He was the most generous fellow in the world, and picturesque

conversation was the one thing in which he never was bankrupt.  With Mr.

Bolton be was the serious man of business, enjoying the confidence of

many of the monied men in New York, whom Mr. Bolton knew, and engaged

with them in railway schemes and government contracts.  Philip, who had

so long known Harry, never could make up his mind that Harry did not

himself believe that he was a chief actor in all these large operations

of which he talked so much.



Harry did not neglect to endeavor to make himself agreeable to Mrs.

Bolton, by paying great attention to the children, and by professing the

warmest interest in the Friends' faith.  It always seemed to him the most

peaceful religion; he thought it must be much easier to live by an

internal light than by a lot of outward rules; he had a dear Quaker aunt

in Providence of whom Mrs. Bolton constantly reminded him.  He insisted

upon going with Mrs. Bolton and the children to the Friends Meeting on

First Day, when Ruth and Alice and Philip, "world's people," went to a

church in town, and he sat through the hour of silence with his hat on,

in most exemplary patience.  In short, this amazing actor succeeded so

well with Mrs. Bolton, that she said to Philip one day,



"Thy friend, Henry Brierly, appears to be a very worldly minded young

man.  Does he believe in anything?"



"Oh, yes," said Philip laughing, "he believes in more things than any

other person I ever saw."



To Ruth, Harry seemed to be very congenial.  He was never moody for one

thing, but lent himself with alacrity to whatever her fancy was.  He was

gay or grave as the need might be.  No one apparently could enter more

fully into her plans for an independent career.



"My father," said Harry, "was bred a physician, and practiced a little

before he went into Wall street.  I always had a leaning to the study.

There was a skeleton hanging in the closet of my father's study when I

was a boy, that I used to dress up in old clothes.  Oh, I got quite

familiar with the human frame."



"You must have," said Philip.  "Was that where you learned to play the

bones?  He is a master of those musical instruments, Ruth; he plays well

enough to go on the stage."



"Philip hates science of any kind, and steady application," retorted

Harry.  He didn't fancy Philip's banter, and when the latter had gone

out, and Ruth asked,



"Why don't you take up medicine, Mr. Brierly?"



Harry said, "I have it in mind.  I believe I would begin attending

lectures this winter if it weren't for being wanted in Washington.  But

medicine is particularly women's province."



"Why so?" asked Ruth, rather amused.



"Well, the treatment of disease is a good deal a matter of sympathy.

A woman's intuition is better than a man's.  Nobody knows anything,

really, you know, and a woman can guess a good deal nearer than a man."



"You are very complimentary to my sex."



"But," said Harry frankly; "I should want to choose my doctor; an ugly

woman would ruin me, the disease would be sure to strike in and kill me

at sight of her.  I think a pretty physician, with engaging manners,

would coax a fellow to live through almost anything."



"I am afraid you are a scoffer, Mr. Brierly."



"On the contrary, I am quite sincere.  Wasn't it old what's his name?

that said only the beautiful is useful?"



Whether Ruth was anything more than diverted with Harry's company; Philip

could not determine.  He scorned at any rate to advance his own interest

by any disparaging communications about Harry, both because he could not

help liking the fellow himself, and because he may have known that he

could not more surely create a sympathy for him in Ruth's mind.  That

Ruth was in no danger of any serious impression he felt pretty sure,

felt certain of it when he reflected upon her severe occupation with her

profession.  Hang it, he would say to himself, she is nothing but pure

intellect anyway.  And he only felt uncertain of it when she was in one

of her moods of raillery, with mocking mischief in her eyes.  At such

times she seemed to prefer Harry's society to his.  When Philip was

miserable about this, he always took refuge with Alice, who was never

moody, and who generally laughed him out of his sentimental nonsense.

He felt at his ease with Alice, and was never in want of something to

talk about; and he could not account for the fact that he was so often

dull with Ruth, with whom, of all persons in the world, he wanted to

appear at his best.



Harry was entirely satisfied with his own situation.  A bird of passage

is always at its ease, having no house to build, and no responsibility.

He talked freely with Philip about Ruth, an almighty fine girl, he said,

but what the deuce she wanted to study medicine for, he couldn't see.



There was a concert one night at the Musical Fund Hall and the four had

arranged to go in and return by the Germantown cars.  It was Philip's

plan, who had engaged the seats, and promised himself an evening with

Ruth, walking with her, sitting by her in the hall, and enjoying the

feeling of protecting that a man always has of a woman in a public place.

He was fond of music, too, in a sympathetic way; at least, he knew that

Ruth's delight in it would be enough for him.



Perhaps he meant to take advantage of the occasion to say some very

serious things.  His love for Ruth was no secret to Mrs. Bolton, and he

felt almost sure that he should have no opposition in the family.  Mrs.

Bolton had been cautious in what she said, but Philip inferred everything

from her reply to his own questions, one day, "Has thee ever spoken thy

mind to Ruth?"



Why shouldn't he speak his mind, and end his doubts?  Ruth had been more

tricksy than usual that day, and in a flow of spirits quite inconsistent,

it would seem, in a young lady devoted to grave studies.



Had Ruth a premonition of Philip's intention, in his manner?  It may be,

for when the girls came down stairs, ready to walk to the cars; and met

Philip and Harry in the hall, Ruth said, laughing,



"The two tallest must walk together" and before Philip knew how it

happened Ruth had taken Harry's arm, and his evening was spoiled.  He had

too much politeness and good sense and kindness to show in his manner

that he was hit.  So he said to Harry,



"That's your disadvantage in being short."  And he gave Alice no reason

to feel during the evening that she would not have been his first choice

for the excursion.  But he was none the less chagrined, and not a little

angry at the turn the affair took.



The Hall was crowded with the fashion of the town.  The concert was one

of those fragmentary drearinesses that people endure because they are

fashionable; tours de force on the piano, and fragments from operas,

which have no meaning without the setting, with weary pauses of waiting

between; there is the comic basso who is so amusing and on such familiar

terms with the audience, and always sings the Barber; the attitudinizing

tenor, with his languishing "Oh, Summer Night;" the soprano with her

"Batti Batti," who warbles and trills and runs and fetches her breath,

and ends with a noble scream that brings down a tempest of applause in

the midst of which she backs off the stage smiling and bowing.  It was

this sort of concert, and Philip was thinking that it was the most stupid

one he ever sat through, when just as the soprano was in the midst of

that touching ballad, "Comin' thro' the Rye" (the soprano always sings

"Comin' thro' the Rye" on an encore)--the Black Swan used to make it

irresistible, Philip remembered, with her arch, "If a body kiss a body"

there was a cry of "Fire!"



The hall is long and narrow, and there is only one place of egress.

Instantly the audience was on its feet, and a rush began for the door.

Men shouted, women screamed, and panic seized the swaying mass.

A second's thought would have convinced every one that getting out was

impossible, and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people

to death.  But a second's thought was not given.  A few cried:



"Sit down, sit down," but the mass was turned towards the door.  Women

were down and trampled on in the aisles, and stout men, utterly lost to

self-control, were mounting the benches, as if to run a race over the

mass to the entrance.



Philip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw, in a flash, the

new danger, and sprang to avert it.  In a second more those infuriated

men would be over the benches and crushing Ruth and Alice under their

boots.  He leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before

him with all his might, felling one man who was rushing on him, and

checking for an instant the movement, or rather parting it, and causing

it to flow on either side of him.  But it was only for an instant; the

pressure behind was too great, and, the next Philip was  dashed backwards

over the seat.



And yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls, for as

Philip fell, the orchestra struck up "Yankee Doodle" in the liveliest

manner.  The familiar tune caught the ear of the mass, which paused in

wonder, and gave the conductor's voice a chance to be heard--"It's a

false alarm!"



The tumult was over in a minute, and the next, laughter was heard, and

not a few said, "I knew it wasn't anything."  "What fools people are at

such a time."



The concert was over, however.  A good many people were hurt, some of

them seriously, and among them Philip Sterling was found bent across the

seat, insensible, with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on

his head.



When he was carried into the air he revived, and said it was nothing.

A surgeon was called, and it was thought best to drive at once to the

Bolton's, the surgeon supporting Philip, who did not speak the whole way.

His arm was set and his head dressed, and the surgeon said he would come

round all right in his mind by morning; he was very weak.  Alice who was

not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall, was very much

unnerved by seeing Philip so pale and bloody.  Ruth assisted the surgeon

with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress Philip's

wounds.  And there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in what she

did that might have revealed something to Philip if he had been in his

senses.



But he was not, or he would not have murmured "Let Alice do it, she is

not too tall."



It was Ruth's first case.









CHAPTER, XXXII.



Washington's delight in his beautiful sister was measureless.  He said

that she had always been the queenliest creature in the land, but that

she was only commonplace before, compared to what she was now, so

extraordinary was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire.



"But your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended

on, Washington.  Other people will judge differently."



"Indeed they won't.  You'll see.  There will never be a woman in

Washington that can compare with you.  You'll be famous within a

fortnight, Laura.  Everybody will want to know you.  You wait--you'll

see."



Laura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true; and

privately she even believed it might--for she had brought all the women

whom she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection, and the

result had not been unsatisfactory to her.



During a week or two Washington drove about the city every day with her

and familiarized her with all of its salient features.  She was beginning

to feel very much at home with the town itself, and she was also fast

acquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the Dilworthy

table, and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with

her from Hawkeye.  She noticed with secret pleasure the little start of

admiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests when

she entered the drawing-room arrayed in evening costume: she took

comforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal

share of their conversation toward her; she observed with surprise, that

famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods, as a general thing,

but said rather commonplace things for the most part; and she was filled

with gratification to discover that she, on the contrary, was making a

good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant one, and

furthermore, that they were beginning to be repeated in social circles

about the town.



Congress began its sittings, and every day or two Washington escorted her

to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households of Senators

and Representatives.  Here was a larger field and a wider competition,

but still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her face, and that

first one person and then another called a neighbor's attention to her;

she was not too dull to perceive that the speeches of some of the younger

statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps more at her than to

the presiding officer; and she was not sorry to see that the dapper young

Senator from Iowa came at once and stood in the open space before the

president's desk to exhibit his feet as soon as she entered the gallery,

whereas she had early learned from common report that his usual custom

was to prop them on his desk and enjoy them himself with a selfish

disregard of other people's longings.



Invitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly "in

society."  "The season" was now in full bloom, and the first select

reception was at hand that is to say, a reception confined to invited

guests.  Senator Dilworthy had become well convinced; by this time, that

his judgment of the country-bred Missouri girl had not deceived him--it

was plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of

labor he designed her for, and therefore it would be perfectly safe and

likewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work.--So he

had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe, and assisted

their attractions with costly jewelry-loans on the future land sale.



This first select reception took place at a cabinet minister's--or rather

a cabinet secretary's mansion.  When Laura and the Senator arrived, about

half past nine or ten in the evening, the place was already pretty well

crowded, and the white-gloved negro servant at the door was still

receiving streams of guests.--The drawing-rooms were brilliant with

gaslight, and as hot as ovens.  The host and hostess stood just within

the door of entrance; Laura was presented, and then she passed on into

the maelstrom of be-jeweled and richly attired low-necked ladies and

white-kid-gloved and steel pen-coated gentlemen and wherever she moved

she was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to all her

senses--so grateful, indeed, that her white face was tinged and its

beauty heightened by a perceptible suffusion of color.  She caught such

remarks as, "Who is she?"  "Superb woman!"  "That is the new beauty from

the west," etc., etc.



Whenever she halted, she was presently surrounded by Ministers, Generals,

Congressmen, and all manner of aristocratic, people.  Introductions

followed, and then the usual original question, "How do you like

Washington, Miss Hawkins?" supplemented by that other usual original

question, "Is this your first visit?"



These two exciting topics being exhausted, conversation generally drifted

into calmer channels, only to be interrupted at frequent intervals by new

introductions and new inquiries as to how Laura liked the capital and

whether it was her first visit or not.  And thus for an hour or more the

Duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of happiness, for her doubts

were dead and gone, now she knew she could conquer here.  A familiar face

appeared in the midst of the multitude and Harry Brierly fought his

difficult way to her side, his eyes shouting their gratification, so to

speak:



"Oh, this is a happiness!  Tell me, my dear Miss Hawkins--"



"Sh!  I know what you are going to ask.  I do like Washington--I like it

ever so much!"



"No, but I was going to ask--"



"Yes, I am coming to it, coming to it as fast as I can.  It is my first

visit.  I think you should know that yourself."



And straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach.



"Now what can the girl mean?  Of course she likes Washington--I'm not

such a dummy as to have to ask her that.  And as to its being her first

visit, why bang it, she knows that I knew it was.  Does she think I have

turned idiot?  Curious girl, anyway.  But how they do swarm about her!

She is the reigning belle of Washington after this night.  She'll know

five hundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night's

nonsense is over.  And this isn't even the beginning.  Just as I used to

say--she'll be a card in the matter of--yes sir!  She shall turn the

men's heads and I'll turn the women's!  What a team that will be in

politics here.  I wouldn't take a quarter of a million for what I can do

in this present session--no indeed I wouldn't.  Now, here--I don't

altogether like this.  That insignificant secretary of legation is--why,

she's smiling on him as if he--and now on the Admiral!  Now she's

illuminating that, stuffy Congressman from Massachusetts--vulgar

ungrammatcal shovel-maker--greasy knave of spades.  I don't like this

sort of thing.  She doesn't appear to be much distressed about me--she

hasn't looked this way once.  All right, my bird of Paradise, if it suits

you, go on.  But I think I know your sex.  I'll go to smiling around a

little, too, and see what effect that will have on you"



And he did "smile around a little," and got as near to her as he could to

watch the effect, but the scheme was a failure--he could not get her

attention.  She seemed wholly unconscious of him, and so he could not

flirt with any spirit; he could only talk disjointedly; he could not keep

his eyes on the charmers he talked to; he grew irritable, jealous, and

very, unhappy.  He gave up his enterprise, leaned his shoulder against a

fluted pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon Laura's every

movement.  His other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek

that brushed him in the surging crush, but he noted it not.  He was too

busy cursing himself inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile.  An hour

ago he had thought to take this country lass under his protection and

show her "life" and enjoy her wonder and delight--and here she was,

immersed in the marvel up to her eyes, and just a trifle more at home in

it than he was himself.  And now his angry comments ran on again:



"Now she's sweetening old Brother Balaam; and he--well he is inviting her

to the Congressional prayer-meeting, no doubt--better let old Dilworthy

alone to see that she doesn't overlook that.  And now its Splurge, of New

York; and now its Batters of New Hampshire--and now the Vice President!

Well I may as well adjourn.  I've got enough."



But he hadn't.  He got as far as the door--and then struggled back to

take one more look, hating himself all the while for his weakness.



Toward midnight, when supper was announced, the crowd thronged to the

supper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare

repast, but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye

than the appetite.  The ladies were soon seated in files along the wall,

and in groups here and there, and the colored waiters filled the plates

and glasses and the, male guests moved hither and thither conveying them

to the privileged sex.



Harry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen, and

listened to the buzz of conversation while he ate.



From these remarks he learned a good deal about Laura that was news to

him.  For instance, that she was of a distinguished western family; that

she was highly educated; that she was very rich and a great landed

heiress; that she was not a professor of religion, and yet was a

Christian in the truest and best sense of the word, for her whole heart

was devoted to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise--none

other than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the

down-trodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of

light and righteousness.  Harry observed that as soon as one listener had

absorbed the story, he turned about and delivered it to his next neighbor

and the latter individual straightway passed it on.  And thus he saw it

travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the ladies.

He could not trace it backward to its fountain head, and so he could not

tell who it was that started it.



One thing annoyed Harry a great deal; and that was the reflection that he

might have been in Washington days and days ago and thrown his

fascinations about Laura with permanent effect while she was new and

strange to the capital, instead of dawdling in Philadelphia to no

purpose.  He feared he had "missed a trick," as he expressed it.



He only found one little opportunity of speaking again with Laura before

the evening's festivities ended, and then, for the first time in years,

his airy self-complacency failed him, his tongue's easy confidence

forsook it in a great measure, and he was conscious of an unheroic

timidity.  He was glad to get away and find a place where he could

despise himself in private and try to grow his clipped plumes again.



When Laura reached home she was tired but exultant, and Senator Dilworthy

was pleased and satisfied.  He called Laura "my daughter," next morning,

and gave her some "pin money," as he termed it, and she sent a hundred

and fifty dollars of it to her mother and loaned a trifle to Col.

Sellers.  Then the Senator had a long private conference with Laura, and

unfolded certain plans of his for the good of the country, and religion,

and the poor, and temperance, and showed her how she could assist him in

developing these worthy and noble enterprises.









CHAPTER XXXIII.



Laura soon discovered that there were three distinct aristocracies in

Washington.  One of these, (nick-named the Antiques,) consisted of

cultivated, high-bred old families who looked back with pride upon an

ancestry that had been always great in the nation's councils and its wars

from the birth of the republic downward.  Into this select circle it was

difficult to gain admission.  No. 2 was the aristocracy of the middle

ground--of which, more anon.  No. 3 lay beyond; of it we will say a word

here.  We will call it the Aristocracy of the Parvenus--as, indeed, the

general public did.  Official position, no matter how obtained, entitled

a man to a place in it, and carried his family with him, no matter whence

they sprang.  Great wealth gave a man a still higher and nobler place in

it than did official position.  If this wealth had been acquired by

conspicuous ingenuity, with just a pleasant little spice of illegality

about it, all the better.  This aristocracy was "fast," and not averse to

ostentation.



The aristocracy of the Antiques ignored the aristocracy of the Parvenus;

the Parvenus laughed at the Antiques, (and secretly envied them.)



There were certain important "society" customs which one in Laura's

position needed to understand.  For instance, when a lady of any

prominence comes to one of our cities and takes up her residence, all the

ladies of her grade favor her in turn with an initial call, giving their

cards to the servant at the door by way of introduction.  They come

singly, sometimes; sometimes in couples; and always in elaborate full

dress.  They talk two minutes and a quarter and then go.  If the lady

receiving the call desires a further acquaintance, she must return the

visit within two weeks; to neglect it beyond that time means "let the

matter drop."  But if she does return the visit within two weeks, it then

becomes the other party's privilege to continue the acquaintance or drop

it.  She signifies her willingness to continue it by calling again any

time within twelve-months; after that, if the parties go on calling upon

each other once a year, in our large cities, that is sufficient, and the

acquaintanceship holds good.  The thing goes along smoothly, now.

The annual visits are made and returned with peaceful regularity and

bland satisfaction, although it is not necessary that the two ladies

shall actually see each other oftener than once every few years.  Their

cards preserve the intimacy and keep the acquaintanceship intact.



For instance, Mrs. A.  pays her annual visit, sits in her carriage and

sends in her card with the lower right hand corner turned down, which

signifies that she has "called in person;" Mrs. B: sends down word that

she is "engaged" or "wishes to be excused"--or if she is a Parvenu and

low-bred, she perhaps sends word that she is "not at home."  Very good;

Mrs. A.  drives, on happy and content.  If Mrs. A.'s daughter marries,

or a child is born to the family, Mrs. B. calls, sends in her card with

the upper left hand corner turned down, and then goes along about her

affairs--for that inverted corner means "Congratulations."  If Mrs. B.'s

husband falls downstairs and breaks his neck, Mrs. A. calls, leaves her

card with the upper right hand corner turned down, and then takes her

departure; this corner means "Condolence."  It is very necessary to get

the corners right, else one may unintentionally condole with a friend on

a wedding or congratulate her upon a funeral.  If either lady is about to

leave the city, she goes to the other's house and leaves her card with

"P. P. C." engraved under the name--which signifies, "Pay Parting Call."

But enough of etiquette.  Laura was early instructed in the mysteries of

society life by a competent mentor, and thus was preserved from

troublesome mistakes.



The first fashionable call she received from a member of the ancient

nobility, otherwise the Antiques, was of a pattern with all she received

from that limb of the aristocracy afterward.  This call was paid by Mrs.

Major-General Fulke-Fulkerson and daughter.  They drove up at one in the

afternoon in a rather antiquated vehicle with a faded coat of arms on the

panels, an aged white-wooled negro coachman on the box and a younger

darkey beside him--the footman.  Both of these servants were dressed in

dull brown livery that had seen considerable service.



The ladies entered the drawing-room in full character; that is to say,

with Elizabethan stateliness on the part of the dowager, and an easy

grace and dignity on the part of the young lady that had a nameless

something about it that suggested conscious superiority.  The dresses of

both ladies were exceedingly rich, as to material, but as notably modest

as to color and ornament.  All parties having seated themselves, the

dowager delivered herself of a remark that was not unusual in its form,

and yet it came from her lips with the impressiveness of Scripture:



"The weather has been unpropitious of late, Miss Hawkins."



"It has indeed," said Laura.  "The climate seems to be variable."



"It is its nature of old, here," said the daughter--stating it apparently

as a fact, only, and by her manner waving aside all personal

responsibility on account of it.  "Is it not so, mamma?"



"Quite so, my child.  Do you like winter, Miss Hawkins?"  She said "like"

as if she had, an idea that its dictionary meaning was "approve of."



"Not as well as summer--though I think all seasons have their charms."



"It is a very just remark.  The general held similar views.  He

considered snow in winter proper; sultriness in summer legitimate; frosts

in the autumn the same, and rains in spring not objectionable.  He was

not an exacting man.  And I call to mind now that he always admired

thunder.  You remember, child, your father always admired thunder?"



"He adored it."



No doubt it reminded him of battle," said Laura.



"Yes, I think perhaps it did.  He had a great respect for Nature.

He often said there was something striking about the ocean.  You remember

his saying that, daughter?"



"Yes, often, Mother.  I remember it very well."



"And hurricanes...  He took a great interest in hurricanes.  And animals.

Dogs, especially--hunting dogs.  Also comets.  I think we all have our

predilections.  I think it is this that gives variety to our tastes."



Laura coincided with this view.



"Do you find it hard and lonely to be so far from your home and friends,

Miss Hawkins?"



"I do find it depressing sometimes, but then there is so much about me

here that is novel and interesting that my days are made up more of

sunshine than shadow."



"Washington is not a dull city in the season," said the young lady.

"We have some very good society indeed, and one need not be at a loss for

means to pass the time pleasantly.  Are you fond of watering-places, Miss

Hawkins?"



"I have really had no experience of them, but I have always felt a strong

desire to see something of fashionable watering-place life."



"We of Washington are unfortunately situated in that respect," said the

dowager.  "It is a tedious distance to Newport.  But there is no help for

it."



Laura said to herself, "Long Branch and Cape May are nearer than Newport;

doubtless these places are low; I'll feel my way a little and see."  Then

she said aloud:



"Why I thought that Long Branch--"



There was no need to "feel" any further--there was that in both faces

before her which made that truth apparent.  The dowager said:



"Nobody goes there, Miss Hawkins--at least only persons of no position in

society.  And the President."  She added that with tranquility.



"Newport is damp, and cold, and windy and excessively disagreeable," said

the daughter, "but it is very select.  One cannot be fastidious about

minor matters when one has no choice."



The visit had spun out nearly three minutes, now.  Both ladies rose with

grave dignity, conferred upon Laura a formal invitation to call, aid then

retired from the conference.  Laura remained in the drawing-room and left

them to pilot themselves out of the house--an inhospitable thing,

it seemed to her, but then she was following her instructions.  She

stood, steeped in reverie, a while, and then she said:



"I think I could always enjoy icebergs--as scenery but not as company."



Still, she knew these two people by reputation, and was aware that they

were not ice-bergs when they were in their own waters and amid their

legitimate surroundings, but on the contrary were people to be respected

for their stainless characters and esteemed for their social virtues and

their benevolent impulses.  She thought it a pity that they had to be

such changed and dreary creatures on occasions of state.



The first call Laura received from the other extremity of the Washington

aristocracy followed close upon the heels of the one we have just been

describing.  The callers this time were the Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins,

the Hon. Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay,) Miss Bridget

(pronounced Breezhay) Oreille, Mrs. Peter Gashly, Miss Gashly, and Miss

Emmeline Gashly.



The three carriages arrived at the same moment from different directions.

They were new and wonderfully shiny, and the brasses on the harness were

highly polished and bore complicated monograms.  There were showy coats

of arms, too, with Latin mottoes.  The coachmen and footmen were clad in

bright new livery, of striking colors, and they had black rosettes with

shaving-brushes projecting above them, on the sides of their stove-pipe

hats.



When the visitors swept into the drawing-room they filled the place with

a suffocating sweetness procured at the perfumer's.  Their costumes, as

to architecture, were the latest fashion intensified; they were rainbow-

hued; they were hung with jewels--chiefly diamonds.  It would have been

plain to any eye that it had cost something to upholster these women.



The Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins was the wife of a delegate from a distant

territory--a gentleman who had kept the principal "saloon," and sold the

best whiskey in the principal village in his wilderness, and so, of

course, was recognized as the first man of his commonwealth and its

fittest representative.



He was a man of paramount influence at home, for he was public spirited,

he was chief of the fire department, he had an admirable command of

profane language, and had killed several "parties."  His shirt fronts

were always immaculate; his boots daintily polished, and no man could

lift a foot and fire a dead shot at a stray speck of dirt on it with a

white handkerchief with a finer grace than he; his watch chain weighed a

pound; the gold in his finger ring was worth forty five dollars; he wore

a diamond cluster-pin and he parted his hair behind.  He had always been,

regarded as the most elegant gentleman in his territory, and it was

conceded by all that no man thereabouts was anywhere near his equal in

the telling of an obscene story except the venerable white-haired

governor himself.  The Hon. Higgins had not come to serve his country in

Washington for nothing.  The appropriation which he had engineered

through Congress for the maintenance, of the Indians in his Territory

would have made all those savages rich if it had ever got to them.



The Hon. Mrs. Higgins was a picturesque woman, and a fluent talker, and

she held a tolerably high station among the Parvenus.  Her English was

fair enough, as a general thing--though, being of New York origin, she

had the fashion peculiar to many natives of that city of pronouncing saw

and law as if they were spelt sawr and lawr.



Petroleum was the agent that had suddenly transformed the Gashlys from

modest hard-working country village folk into "loud" aristocrats and

ornaments of the city.



The Hon. Patrique Oreille was a wealthy Frenchman from Cork.  Not that he

was wealthy when he first came from Cork, but just the reverse.  When he

first landed in New York with his wife, he had only halted at Castle

Garden for a few minutes to receive and exhibit papers showing that he

had resided in this country two years--and then he voted the democratic

ticket and went up town to hunt a house.  He found one and then went to

work as assistant to an architect and builder, carrying a hod all day and

studying politics evenings.  Industry and economy soon enabled him to

start a low rum shop in a foul locality, and this gave him political

influence.  In our country it is always our first care to see that our

people have the opportunity of voting for their choice of men to

represent and govern them--we do not permit our great officials to

appoint the little officials.  We prefer to have so tremendous a power as

that in our own hands.  We hold it safest to elect our judges and

everybody else.  In our cities, the ward meetings elect delegates to the

nominating conventions and instruct them whom to nominate.  The publicans

and their retainers rule the ward meetings (for every body else hates the

worry of politics and stays at home); the delegates from the ward

meetings organize as a nominating convention and make up a list of

candidates--one convention offering a democratic and another a republican

list of incorruptibles; and then the great meek public come forward at

the proper time and make unhampered choice and bless Heaven that they

live in a free land where no form of despotism can ever intrude.



Patrick O'Riley (as his name then stood) created friends and influence

very, fast, for he was always on hand at the police courts to give straw

bail for his customers or establish an alibi for them in case they had

been beating anybody to death on his premises.  Consequently he presently

became a political leader, and was elected to a petty office under the

city government.  Out of a meager salary he soon saved money enough to

open quite a stylish liquor saloon higher up town, with a faro bank

attached and plenty of capital to conduct it with.  This gave him fame

and great respectability.  The position of alderman was forced upon him,

and it was just the same as presenting him a gold mine.  He had fine

horses and carriages, now, and closed up his whiskey mill.



By and by he became a large contractor for city work, and was a bosom

friend of the great and good Wm. M. Weed himself, who had stolen

$20,600,000 from the city and was a man so envied, so honored,--so

adored, indeed, that when the sheriff went to his office to arrest him as

a felon, that sheriff blushed and apologized, and one of the illustrated

papers made a picture of the scene and spoke of the matter in such a way

as to show that the editor regretted that the offense of an arrest had

been offered to so exalted a personage as Mr. Weed.



Mr. O'Riley furnished shingle nails to, the new Court House at three

thousand dollars a keg, and eighteen gross of 60-cent thermometers at

fifteen hundred dollars a dozen; the controller and the board of audit

passed the bills, and a mayor, who was simply ignorant but not criminal,

signed them.  When they were paid, Mr. O'Riley's admirers gave him a

solitaire diamond pin of the size of a filbert, in imitation of the

liberality of Mr. Weed's friends, and then Mr. O'Riley retired from

active service and amused himself with buying real estate at enormous

figures and holding it in other people's names.  By and by the newspapers

came out with exposures and called Weed and O'Riley "thieves,"--whereupon

the people rose as one man (voting repeatedly) and elected the two

gentlemen to their proper theatre of action, the New York legislature.

The newspapers clamored, and the courts proceeded to try the new

legislators for their small irregularities.  Our admirable jury system

enabled the persecuted ex-officials to secure a jury of nine gentlemen

from a neighboring asylum and three graduates from Sing-Sing, and

presently they walked forth with characters vindicated.  The legislature

was called upon to spew them forth--a thing which the legislature

declined to do.  It was like asking children to repudiate their own

father.  It was a legislature of the modern pattern.



Being now wealthy and distinguished, Mr. O'Riley, still bearing the

legislative "Hon." attached to his name (for titles never die in America,

although we do take a republican pride in poking fun at such trifles),

sailed for Europe with his family.  They traveled all about, turning

their noses up at every thing, and not finding it a difficult thing to

do, either, because nature had originally given those features a cast in

that direction; and finally they established themselves in Paris, that

Paradise of Americans of their sort.--They staid there two years and

learned to speak English with a foreign accent--not that it hadn't always

had a foreign accent (which was indeed the case) but now the nature of it

was changed.  Finally they returned home and became ultra fashionables.

They landed here as the Hon.  Patrique Oreille and family, and so are

known unto this day.



Laura provided seats for her visitors and they immediately launched forth

into a breezy, sparkling conversation with that easy confidence which is

to be found only among persons accustomed to high life.



"I've been intending to call sooner, Miss Hawkins," said the Hon. Mrs.

Oreille, "but the weather's been so horrid.  How do you like Washington?"



Laura liked it very well indeed.



Mrs. Gashly--"Is it your first visit?"



Yea, it was her first.



All--"Indeed?"



Mrs. Oreille--"I'm afraid you'll despise the weather, Miss Hawkins.

It's perfectly awful.  It always is.  I tell Mr. Oreille I can't and

I won't put up with any such a climate.  If we were obliged to do it,

I wouldn't mind it; but we are not obliged to, and so I don't see the use

of it.  Sometimes its real pitiful the way the childern pine for Parry--

don't look so sad, Bridget, 'ma chere'--poor child, she can't hear Parry

mentioned without getting the blues."



Mrs. Gashly--"Well I should think so, Mrs. Oreille.  A body lives in

Paris, but a body, only stays here.  I dote on Paris; I'd druther scrimp

along on ten thousand dollars a year there, than suffer and worry here on

a real decent income."



Miss Gashly--"Well then, I wish you'd take us back, mother; I'm sure I

hate this stoopid country enough, even if it is our dear native land."



Miss Emmeline Gashly--"What and leave poor Johnny Peterson behind?" [An

airy genial laugh applauded this sally].



Miss Gashly--"Sister, I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself!"



Miss Emmeline--"Oh, you needn't ruffle your feathers so: I was only

joking.  He don't mean anything by coming to, the house every evening--

only comes to see mother.  Of course that's all!" [General laughter].



Miss G. prettily confused--"Emmeline, how can you!"



Mrs. G.--"Let your sister alone, Emmeline.  I never saw such a tease!"



Mrs. Oreille--"What lovely corals you have, Miss Hawkins!  Just look at

them, Bridget, dear.  I've a great passion for corals--it's a pity

they're getting a little common.  I have some elegant ones--not as

elegant as yours, though--but of course I don't wear them now."



Laura--"I suppose they are rather common, but still I have a great

affection for these, because they were given to me by a dear old friend

of our family named Murphy.  He was a very charming man, but very

eccentric.  We always supposed he was an Irishman, but after be got rich

he went abroad for a year or two, and when he came back you would have

been amused to see how interested he was in a potato.  He asked what it

was!  Now you know that when Providence shapes a mouth especially for the

accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at a glance when that

mouth is in repose--foreign travel can never remove that sign.  But he

was a very delightful gentleman, and his little foible did not hurt him

at all.  We all have our shams--I suppose there is a sham somewhere about

every individual, if we could manage to ferret it out.  I would so like

to go to France.  I suppose our society here compares very favorably with

French society does it not, Mrs. Oreille?"



Mrs. O.--"Not by any means, Miss Hawkins!  French society is much more

elegant--much more so."



Laura--"I am sorry to hear that.  I suppose ours has deteriorated of

late."



Mrs. O.--"Very much indeed.  There are people in society here that have

really no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant

hire.  Still I won't say but what some of them are very good people--and

respectable, too."



Laura--"The old families seem to be holding themselves aloof, from what I

hear.  I suppose you seldom meet in society now, the people you used to

be familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago?"



Mrs. O.--"Oh, no-hardly ever."



Mr. O'Riley kept his first rum-mill and protected his customers from the

law in those days, and this turn of the conversation was rather

uncomfortable to madame than otherwise.



Hon. Mrs. Higgins--"Is Francois' health good now, Mrs. Oreille?"



Mrs. O.--(Thankful for the intervention)--"Not very.  A body couldn't

expect it.  He was always delicate--especially his lungs--and this odious

climate tells on him strong, now, after Parry, which is so mild."



Mrs. H:--"I should think so.  Husband says Percy'll die if he don't have

a change; and so I'm going to swap round a little and see what can be

done.  I saw a lady from Florida last week, and she recommended Key West.

I told her Percy couldn't abide winds, as he was threatened with a

pulmonary affection, and then she said try St. Augustine.  It's an awful

distance--ten or twelve hundred mile, they say but then in a case of this

kind--a body can't stand back for trouble, you know."



Mrs. O.--"No, of course that's off.  If Francois don't get better soon

we've got to look out for some other place, or else Europe.  We've

thought some of the Hot Springs, but I don't know.  It's a great

responsibility and a body wants to go cautious.  Is Hildebrand about

again, Mrs. Gashly?"



Mrs. G.--"Yes, but that's about all.  It was indigestion, you know, and

it looks as if it was chronic.  And you know I do dread dyspepsia.  We've

all been worried a good deal about him.  The doctor recommended baked

apple and spoiled meat, and I think it done him good.  It's about the

only thing that will stay on his stomach now-a-days.  We have Dr. Shovel

now.  Who's your doctor, Mrs. Higgins?"



Mrs. H.--"Well, we had Dr. Spooner a good while, but he runs so much to

emetics, which I think are weakening, that we changed off and took Dr.

Leathers.  We like him very much.  He has a fine European reputation,

too.  The first thing he suggested for Percy was to have him taken out in

the back yard for an airing, every afternoon, with nothing at all on."



Mrs. O. and Mrs. G.--"What!"



Mrs. H.--"As true as I'm sitting here.  And it actually helped him for

two or three days; it did indeed.  But after that the doctor said it

seemed to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot foot-baths at

night and cold showers in the morning.  But I don't think there, can be

any good sound help for him in such a climate as this.  I believe we are

going to lose him if we don't make a change."



Mrs. O.  "I suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last

Saturday?  No?  Why that is strange--but come to remember, you've all

been away to Richmond.  Francois tumbled from the sky light--in the

second-story hall clean down to the first floor--"



Everybody--"Mercy!"



Mrs.  O.--"Yes indeed--and broke two of his ribs--"



Everybody--"What!"



Mrs. O.  "Just as true as you live.  First we thought he must be injured

internally.  It was fifteen minutes past 8 in the evening.  Of course we

were all distracted in a moment--everybody was flying everywhere, and

nobody doing anything worth anything.  By and by I flung out next door

and dragged in Dr. Sprague; President of the Medical University no time

to go for our own doctor of course--and the minute he saw Francois he

said, 'Send for your own physician, madam;' said it as cross as a bear,

too, and turned right on his heel, and cleared out without doing a

thing!"



Everybody--"The mean, contemptible brute!"



Mrs. O--"Well you may say it.  I was nearly out of my wits by this time.

But we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and telegraphed

mother--she was in New York and rushed down on the first train; and when

the doctor got there, lo and behold you he found Francois had broke one

of his legs, too!"



Everybody--"Goodness!"



Mrs. O.--"Yes.  So he set his leg and bandaged it up, and fixed his ribs

and gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and put him

to sleep--poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and it was

pitiful to see him.  We had him in my bed--Mr. Oreille slept in the guest

room and I laid down beside Francois--but not to sleep bless you no.

Bridget and I set up all night, and the doctor staid till two in the

morning, bless his old heart.--When mother got there she was so used up

with anxiety, that she had to go to bed and have the doctor; but when she

found that Francois was not in immediate danger she rallied, and by night

she was able to take a watch herself.  Well for three days and nights we

three never left that bedside only to take an hour's nap at a time.

And then the doctor said Francois was out of danger and if ever there was

a thankful set, in this world, it was us."



Laura's respect for these, women had augmented during this conversation,

naturally enough; affection and devotion are qualities that are able to

adorn and render beautiful a character that is otherwise unattractive,

and even repulsive.



Mrs. Gashly--"I do believe I would a died if I had been in your place,

Mrs. Oreille.  The time Hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia Emmeline

and me were all, alone with him most of the time and we never took a

minute's sleep for as much as two days, and nights.  It was at Newport

and we wouldn't trust hired nurses.  One afternoon he had a fit, and

jumped up and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the

world on and the wind a blowing liken ice and we after him scared to

death; and when the ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit, every

lady scattered for her room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help,

the wretches!  Well after that his life hung by a thread for as much as

ten days, and the minute he was out of danger Emmeline and me just went

to bed sick and worn out.  I never want to pass through such a time

again.  Poor dear Francois--which leg did he break, Mrs. Oreille!"



Mrs. O.--"It was his right hand hind leg.  Jump down, Francois dear, and

show the ladies what a cruel limp you've got yet."



Francois demurred, but being coaxed and delivered gently upon the floor,

he performed very satisfactorily, with his "right hand hind leg" in the

air.  All were affected--even Laura--but hers was an affection of the

stomach.  The country-bred girl had not suspected that the little whining

ten-ounce black and tan reptile, clad in a red embroidered pigmy blanket

and reposing in Mrs. Oreille's lap all through the visit was the

individual whose sufferings had been stirring the dormant generosities of

her nature.  She said:



"Poor little creature!  You might have lost him!"



Mrs. O.--" O pray don't mention it, Miss Hawkins--it gives me such a

turn!"



Laura--"And Hildebrand and Percy--are they-are they like this one?"



Mrs. G.--"No, Hilly has considerable Skye blood in him, I believe."



Mrs. H.--"Percy's the same, only he is two months and ten days older and

has his ears cropped.  His father, Martin Farquhar Tupper, was sickly,

and died young, but he was the sweetest disposition.--His mother had

heart disease but was very gentle and resigned, and a wonderful ratter."

--[** As impossible and exasperating as this conversation may sound to a

person who is not an idiot, it is scarcely in any respect an exaggeration

of one which one of us actually listened to in an American drawing room--

otherwise we could not venture to put such a chapter into a book which,

professes to deal with social possibilities.--THE AUTHORS.]



So carried away had the visitors become by their interest attaching to

this discussion of family matters, that their stay had been prolonged to

a very improper and unfashionable length; but they suddenly recollected

themselves now and took their departure.



Laura's scorn was boundless.  The more she thought of these people and

their extraordinary talk, the more offensive they seemed to her; and yet

she confessed that if one must choose between the two extreme

aristocracies it might be best, on the whole, looking at things from a

strictly business point of view, to herd with the Parvenus; she was in

Washington solely to compass a certain matter and to do it at any cost,

and these people might be useful to her, while it was plain that her

purposes and her schemes for pushing them would not find favor in the

eyes of the Antiques.  If it came to choice--and it might come to that,

sooner or later--she believed she could come to a decision without much

difficulty or many pangs.



But the best aristocracy of the three Washington castes, and really the

most powerful, by far, was that of the Middle Ground: It was made up of

the families of public men from nearly every state in the Union--men who

held positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the

government, and whose characters had been for years blemishless, both at

home and at the capital.  These gentlemen and their households were

unostentatious people; they were educated and refined; they troubled

themselves but little about the two other orders of nobility, but moved

serenely in their wide orbit, confident in their own strength and well

aware of the potency of their influence.  They had no troublesome

appearances to keep up, no rivalries which they cared to distress

themselves about, no jealousies to fret over.  They could afford to mind

their own affairs and leave other combinations to do the same or do

otherwise, just as they chose.  They were people who were beyond

reproach, and that was sufficient.



Senator Dilworthy never came into collision with any of these factions.

He labored for them all and with them all.  He said that all men were

brethren and all were entitled to the honest unselfish help and

countenance of a Christian laborer in the public vineyard.



Laura concluded, after reflection, to let circumstances determine the

course it might be best for her to pursue as regarded the several

aristocracies.



Now it might occur to the reader that perhaps Laura had been somewhat

rudely suggestive in her remarks to Mrs. Oreille when the subject of

corals was under discussion, but it did not occur to Laura herself.

She was not a person of exaggerated refinement; indeed, the society and

the influences that had formed her character had not been of a nature

calculated to make her so; she thought that "give and take was fair

play," and that to parry an offensive thrust with a sarcasm was a neat

and legitimate thing to do.  She some times talked to people in a way

which some ladies would consider, actually shocking; but Laura rather

prided herself upon some of her exploits of that character.  We are sorry

we cannot make her a faultless heroine; but we cannot, for the reason

that she was human.



She considered herself a superior conversationist.  Long ago, when the

possibility had first been brought before her mind that some day she

might move in Washington society, she had recognized the fact that

practiced conversational powers would be a necessary weapon in that

field; she had also recognized the fact that since her dealings there

must be mainly with men, and men whom she supposed to be exceptionally

cultivated and able, she would need heavier shot in her magazine than

mere brilliant "society" nothings; whereupon she had at once entered upon

a tireless and elaborate course of reading, and had never since ceased to

devote every unoccupied moment to this sort of preparation.  Having now

acquired a happy smattering of various information, she used it with good

effect--she passed for a singularly well informed woman in Washington.

The quality of her literary tastes had necessarily undergone constant

improvement under this regimen, and as necessarily, also; the duality of

her language had improved, though it cannot be denied that now and then

her former condition of life betrayed itself in just perceptible

inelegancies of expression and lapses of grammar.









CHAPTER XXXIV.



When Laura had been in Washington three months, she was still the same

person, in one respect, that she was when she first arrived there--that

is to say, she still bore the name of Laura Hawkins.  Otherwise she was

perceptibly changed.--



She had arrived in a state of grievous uncertainty as to what manner of

woman she was, physically and intellectually, as compared with eastern

women; she was well satisfied, now, that her beauty was confessed, her

mind a grade above the average, and her powers of fascination rather

extraordinary.  So she, was at ease upon those points.  When she arrived,

she was possessed of habits of economy and not possessed of money; now

she dressed elaborately, gave but little thought to the cost of things,

and was very well fortified financially.  She kept her mother and

Washington freely supplied with money, and did the same by Col. Sellers--

who always insisted upon giving his note for loans--with interest; he was

rigid upon that; she must take interest; and one of the Colonel's

greatest satisfactions was to go over his accounts and note what a

handsome sum this accruing interest amounted to, and what a comfortable

though modest support it would yield Laura in case reverses should

overtake her.



In truth he could not help feeling that he was an efficient shield for

her against poverty; and so, if her expensive ways ever troubled him for

a brief moment, he presently dismissed the thought and said to himself,

"Let her go on--even if she loses everything she is still safe--this

interest will always afford her a good easy income."



Laura was on excellent terms with a great many members of Congress, and

there was an undercurrent of suspicion in some quarters that she was one

of that detested class known as "lobbyists;" but what belle could escape

slander in such a city?  Fairminded people declined to condemn her on

mere suspicion, and so the injurious talk made no very damaging headway.

She was very gay, now, and very celebrated, and she might well expect to

be assailed by many kinds of gossip.  She was growing used to celebrity,

and could already sit calm and seemingly unconscious, under the fire of

fifty lorgnettes in a theatre, or even overhear the low voice "That's

she!" as she passed along the street without betraying annoyance.



The whole air was full of a vague vast scheme which was to eventuate in

filling Laura's pockets with millions of money; some had one idea of the

scheme, and some another, but nobody had any exact knowledge upon the

subject.  All that any one felt sure about, was that Laura's landed

estates were princely in value and extent, and that the government was

anxious to get hold of them for public purposes, and that Laura was

willing to make the sale but not at all anxious about the matter and not

at all in a hurry.  It was whispered that Senator Dilworthy was a

stumbling block in the way of an immediate sale, because he was resolved

that the government should not have the lands except with the

understanding that they should be devoted to the uplifting of the negro

race; Laura did not care what they were devoted to, it was said, (a world

of very different gossip to the contrary notwithstanding,) but there were

several other heirs and they would be guided entirely by the Senator's

wishes; and finally, many people averred that while it would be easy to

sell the lands to the government for the benefit of the negro, by

resorting to the usual methods of influencing votes, Senator Dilworthy

was unwilling to have so noble a charity sullied by any taint of

corruption--he was resolved that not a vote should be bought.  Nobody

could get anything definite from Laura about these matters, and so gossip

had to feed itself chiefly upon guesses.  But the effect of it all was,

that Laura was considered to be very wealthy and likely to be vastly more

so in a little while.  Consequently she was much courted and as much

envied: Her wealth attracted many suitors.  Perhaps they came to worship

her riches, but they remained to worship her.  Some of the noblest men of

the time succumbed to her fascinations.  She frowned upon no lover when

he made his first advances, but by and by when she was hopelessly

enthralled, he learned from her own lips that she had formed a resolution

never to marry.  Then he would go away hating and cursing the whole sex,

and she would calmly add his scalp to her string, while she mused upon

the bitter day that Col. Selby trampled her love and her pride in the

dust.  In time it came to be said that her way was paved with broken

hearts.



Poor Washington gradually woke up to the fact that he too was an

intellectual marvel as well as his gifted sister.  He could not conceive

how it had come about (it did not occur to him that the gossip about his

family's great wealth had any thing to do with it). He could not account

for it by any process of reasoning, and was simply obliged to accept the

fact and give up trying to solve the riddle.  He found himself dragged

into society and courted, wondered at and envied very much as if he were

one of those foreign barbers who flit over here now and then with a self-

conferred title of nobility and marry some rich fool's absurd daughter.

Sometimes at a dinner party or a reception he would find himself the

centre of interest, and feel unutterably uncomfortable in the discovery.

Being obliged to say something, he would mine his brain and put in a

blast and when the smoke and flying debris had cleared away the result

would be what seemed to him but a poor little intellectual clod of dirt

or two, and then he would be astonished to see everybody as lost in

admiration as if he had brought up a ton or two of virgin gold.  Every

remark he made delighted his hearers and compelled their applause; he

overheard people say he was exceedingly bright--they were chiefly mammas

and marriageable young ladies.  He found that some of his good things

were being repeated about the town.  Whenever he heard of an instance of

this kind, he would keep that particular remark in mind and analyze it at

home in private.  At first he could not see that the remark was anything

better than a parrot might originate; but by and by he began to feel that

perhaps he underrated his powers; and after that he used to analyze his

good things with a deal of comfort, and find in them a brilliancy which

would have been unapparent to him in earlier days--and then he would make

a note, of that good thing and say it again the first time he found

himself in a new company.  Presently he had saved up quite a repertoire

of brilliancies; and after that he confined himself to repeating these

and ceased to originate any more, lest he might injure his reputation by

an unlucky effort.



He was constantly having young ladies thrust upon his notice at

receptions, or left upon his hands at parties, and in time he began to

feel that he was being deliberately persecuted in this way; and after

that he could not enjoy society because of his constant dread of these

female ambushes and surprises.  He was distressed to find that nearly

every time he showed a young lady a polite attention he was straightway

reported to be engaged to her; and as some of these reports got into the

newspapers occasionally, he had to keep writing to Louise that they were

lies and she must believe in him and not mind them or allow them to

grieve her.



Washington was as much in the dark as anybody with regard to the great

wealth that was hovering in the air and seemingly on the point of

tumbling into the family pocket.  Laura would give him no satisfaction.

All she would say, was:



"Wait.  Be patient.  You will see."



"But will it be soon, Laura?"



"It will not be very long, I think."



"But what makes you think so?"



"I have reasons--and good ones.  Just wait, and be patient."



"But is it going to be as much as people say it is?"



"What do they say it is?"



"Oh, ever so much.  Millions!"



"Yes, it will be a great sum."



"But how great, Laura?  Will it be millions?"



"Yes, you may call it that.  Yes, it will be millions.  There, now--does

that satisfy you?"



"Splendid!  I can wait.  I can wait patiently--ever so patiently.  Once I

was near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars; once for thirty

thousand dollars; once after that for seven thousand dollars; and once

for forty thousand dollars--but something always told me not to do it.

What a fool I would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle!  It

is the land that's to bring the money, isn't it Laura?  You can tell me

that much, can't you?"



"Yes, I don't mind saying that much.  It is the land.



"But mind--don't ever hint that you got it from me.  Don't mention me in

the matter at all, Washington."



"All right--I won't.  Millions!  Isn't it splendid!  I mean to look

around for a building lot; a lot with fine ornamental shrubbery and all

that sort of thing.  I will do it to-day.  And I might as well see an

architect, too, and get him to go to work at a plan for a house.  I don't

intend to spare and expense; I mean to have the noblest house that money

can build."  Then after a pause--he did not notice Laura's smiles "Laura,

would you lay the main hall in encaustic tiles, or just in fancy patterns

of hard wood?"



Laura laughed a good old-fashioned laugh that had more of her former

natural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in

many weeks.  She said:



"You don't change, Washington.  You still begin to squander a fortune

right and left the instant you hear of it in the distance; you never wait

till the foremost dollar of it arrives within a hundred miles of you,"--

and she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in his dreams,

so to speak.



He got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours; and when he

sat down he had married Louise, built a house, reared a family, married

them off, spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on mere

luxuries, and died worth twelve millions.









CHAPTER XXXV.





Laura went down stairs, knocked at/the study door, and entered, scarcely

waiting for the response.  Senator Dilworthy was alone--with an open

Bible in his hand, upside down.  Laura smiled, and said, forgetting her

acquired correctness of speech,



"It is only me."



"Ah, come in, sit down," and the Senator closed the book and laid it

down.  "I wanted to see you.  Time to report progress from the committee

of the whole," and the Senator beamed with his own congressional wit.



"In the committee of the whole things are working very well.  We have

made ever so much progress in a week.  I believe that you and I together

could run this government beautifully, uncle."



The Senator beamed again.  He liked to be called "uncle" by this

beautiful woman.



"Did you see Hopperson last night after the congressional prayer

meeting?"



"Yes.  He came.  He's a kind of--"



"Eh? he is one of my friends, Laura.  He's a fine man, a very fine man.

I don't know any man in congress I'd sooner go to for help in any

Christian work.  What did he say?"



"Oh, he beat around a little.  He said he should like to help the negro,

his heart went out to the negro, and all that--plenty of them say that

but he was a little afraid of the Tennessee Land bill; if Senator

Dilworthy wasn't in it, he should suspect there was a fraud on the

government."



"He said that, did he?"



"Yes.  And he said he felt he couldn't vote for it.  He was shy."



"Not shy, child, cautious.  He's a very cautious man.  I have been with

him a great deal on conference committees.  He wants reasons, good ones.

Didn't you show him he was in error about the bill?"



"I did.  I went over the whole thing.  I had to tell him some of the side

arrangements, some of the--"



"You didn't mention me?"



"Oh, no.  I told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy

part of it, as you are."



"Daft is a little strong, Laura.  But you know that I wouldn't touch this

bill if it were not for the public good, and for the good of the colored

race; much as I am interested in the heirs of this property, and would

like to have them succeed."



Laura looked a little incredulous, and the Senator proceeded.



"Don't misunderstand me, I don't deny that it is for the interest of all

of us that this bill should go through, and it will.  I have no

concealments from you.  But I have one principle in my public life, which

I should like you to keep in mind; it has always been my guide.  I never

push a private interest if it is not Justified and ennobled by some

larger public good.  I doubt Christian would be justified in working for

his own salvation if it was not to aid in the salvation of his fellow

men."



The Senator spoke with feeling, and then added,



"I hope you showed Hopperson that our motives were pure?"



"Yes, and he seemed to have a new light on the measure: I think will vote

for it."



"I hope so; his name will give tone and strength to it.  I knew you would

only have to show him that it was just and pure, in order to secure his

cordial support."



"I think I convinced him.  Yes, I am perfectly sure he will vote right

now."



"That's good, that's good," said the Senator; smiling, and rubbing his

hands.  "Is there anything more?"



"You'll find some changes in that I guess," handing the Senator a printed

list of names.  "Those checked off are all right."



"Ah--'m--'m," running his eye down the list.  "That's encouraging.  What

is the 'C' before some of the names, and the 'B. B.'?"



"Those are my private marks.  That 'C' stands for 'convinced,' with

argument.  The 'B. B.' is a general sign for a relative.  You see it

stands before three of the Hon. Committee.  I expect to see the chairman

of the committee to-day, Mr. Buckstone."



"So, you must, he ought to be seen without any delay.  Buckstone is a

worldly sort of a fellow, but he has charitable impulses.  If we secure

him we shall have a favorable report by the committee, and it will be a

great thing to be able to state that fact quietly where it will do good."



"Oh, I saw Senator Balloon"



"He will help us, I suppose?  Balloon is a whole-hearted fellow.  I can't

help loving that man, for all his drollery and waggishness.  He puts on

an air of levity sometimes, but there aint a man in the senate knows the

scriptures as he does.  He did not make any objections?"



"Not exactly, he said--shall I tell you what he said?" asked Laura

glancing furtively at him.



"Certainly."



"He said he had no doubt it was a good thing; if Senator Dilworthy was in

it, it would pay to look into it."



The Senator laughed, but rather feebly, and said, "Balloon is always full

of his jokes."



"I explained it to him.  He said it was all right, he only wanted a word

with you,", continued Laura.  "He is a handsome old gentleman, and he is

gallant for an old man."



"My daughter," said the Senator, with a grave look, "I trust there was

nothing free in his manner?"



"Free?" repeated Laura, with indignation in her face.  "With me!"



"There, there, child.  I meant nothing, Balloon talks a little freely

sometimes, with men.  But he is right at heart.  His term expires next

year and I fear we shall lose him."



"He seemed to be packing the day I was there.  His rooms were full of dry

goods boxes, into which his servant was crowding all manner of old

clothes and stuff: I suppose he will paint 'Pub. Docs' on them and frank

them home.  That's good economy, isn't it?"



"Yes, yes, but child, all Congressmen do that.  It may not be strictly

honest, indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in

with the clothes."



"It's a funny world.  Good-bye, uncle.  I'm going to see that chairman."



And humming a cheery opera air, she departed to her room to dress for

going out.  Before she did that, however, she took out her note book and

was soon deep in its contents; marking, dashing, erasing, figuring, and

talking to herself.



"Free!  I wonder what Dilworthy does think of me anyway?  One .  .  .

two.  .  .eight .  .  .  seventeen .  .  .  twenty-one,.  .  'm'm .  .  .

it takes a heap for a majority.  Wouldn't Dilworthy open his eyes if he

knew some of the things Balloon did say to me.  There.  .  .  .

Hopperson's influence ought to count twenty .  .  .  the sanctimonious

old curmudgeon.  Son-in-law.  .  .  . sinecure in the negro institution

.  .  .  .That about gauges him .  .  . The three committeemen .  .  .  .

sons-in-law.  Nothing like a son-in-law here in Washington or a brother-

in-law .  .  . And everybody has 'em .  .  .Let's see: .  .  .  sixty-

one.  .  .  .  with places .  .  .  twenty-five .  .  .  persuaded--it is

getting on; .  .  .  . we'll have two-thirds of Congress in time .  .  .

Dilworthy must surely know I understand him.  Uncle Dilworthy .  .  .  .

Uncle Balloon!--Tells very amusing stories .  .  .  when ladies are not

present .  .  . I should think so .  .  .  .'m .  .  .  'm.  Eighty-five.

There.  I must find that chairman.  Queer.  .  .  .  Buckstone acts .  .

Seemed to be in love .  .  .  .  .  I was sure of it.  He promised to

come here.  .  . and he hasn't.  .  . Strange.  Very strange .  .  .  .

I must chance to meet him to-day."



Laura dressed and went out, thinking she was perhaps too early for Mr.

Buckstone to come from the house, but as he lodged near the bookstore she

would drop in there and keep a look out for him.



While Laura is on her errand to find Mr. Buckstone, it may not be out of

the way to remark that she knew quite as much of Washington life as

Senator Dilworthy gave her credit for, and more than she thought proper

to tell him.  She was acquainted by this time with a good many of the

young fellows of Newspaper Row; and exchanged gossip with them to their

mutual advantage.



They were always talking in the Row, everlastingly gossiping, bantering

and sarcastically praising things, and going on in a style which was a

curious commingling of earnest and persiflage.  Col. Sellers liked this

talk amazingly, though he was sometimes a little at sea in it--and

perhaps that didn't lessen the relish of the conversation to the

correspondents.



It seems that they had got hold of the dry-goods box packing story about

Balloon, one day, and were talking it over when the Colonel came in.

The Colonel wanted to know all about it, and Hicks told him.  And then

Hicks went on, with a serious air,



"Colonel, if you register a letter, it means that it is of value, doesn't

it?  And if you pay fifteen cents for registering it, the government will

have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it

is lost.  Isn't that so?"



"Yes.  I suppose it's so.".



"Well Senator Balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those

seven huge boxes of old clothes, and shipped that ton of second-hand

rubbish, old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as

registered matter!  It was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch

of humor about it, too.  I think there is more real: talent among our

public men of to-day than there was among those of old times--a far more

fertile fancy, a much happier ingenuity.  Now, Colonel, can you picture

Jefferson, or Washington or John Adams franking their wardrobes through

the mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government

responsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents?

Statesmen were dull creatures in those days.  I have a much greater

admiration for Senator Balloon."



"Yes, Balloon is a man of parts, there is no denying it"



"I think so.  He is spoken of for the post of Minister to China, or

Austria, and I hope will be appointed.  What we want abroad is good

examples of the national character.



"John Jay and Benjamin Franklin were well enough in their day, but the

nation has made progress since then.  Balloon is a man we know and can

depend on to be true to himself."



"Yes, and Balloon has had a good deal of public experience.  He is an old

friend of mine.  He was governor of one of the territories a while, and

was very satisfactory."



"Indeed he was.  He was ex-officio Indian agent, too.  Many a man would

have taken the Indian appropriation and devoted the money to feeding and

clothing the helpless savages, whose land had been taken from them by the

white man in the interests of civilization; but Balloon knew their needs

better.  He built a government saw-mill on the reservation with the

money, and the lumber sold for enormous prices--a relative of his did all

the work free of charge--that is to say he charged nothing more than the

lumber world bring."  "But the poor Injuns--not that I care much for

Injuns--what did he do for them?"



"Gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with.  Governor

Balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor Indians.  But Balloon

is not alone, we have many truly noble statesmen in our country's service

like Balloon.  The Senate is full of them.  Don't you think so Colonel?"



"Well, I dunno.  I honor my country's public servants as much as any one

can.  I meet them, Sir, every day, and the more I see of them the more I

esteem them and the more grateful I am that our institutions give us the

opportunity of securing their services.  Few lands are so blest."



"That is true, Colonel.  To be sure you can buy now and then a Senator or

a Representative but they do not know it is wrong, and so they are not

ashamed of it.  They are gentle, and confiding and childlike, and in my

opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of

sinful sagacity could.  I quite agree with you, Col. Sellers."



"Well"--hesitated the, Colonel--"I am afraid some of them do buy their

seats--yes, I am afraid they do--but as Senator Dilworthy himself said to

me, it is sinful,--it is very wrong--it is shameful; Heaven protect me

from such a charge.  That is what Dilworthy said.  And yet when you come

to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the

services of some of our ablest men, sir, if the country were opposed to--

to--bribery.  It is a harsh term.  I do not like to use it."



The Colonel interrupted himself at this point to meet an engagement with

the Austrian minister, and took his leave with his usual courtly bow.









CHAPTER XXXVI.





In due time Laura alighted at the book store, and began to look at the

titles of the handsome array of books on the counter.  A dapper clerk of

perhaps nineteen or twenty years, with hair accurately parted and

surprisingly slick, came bustling up and leaned over with a pretty smile

and an affable--



"Can I--was there any particular book you wished to see?"



"Have you Taine's England?"



"Beg pardon?"



"Taine's Notes on England."



The young gentleman scratched the side of his nose with a cedar pencil

which he took down from its bracket on the side of his head, and

reflected a moment:



"Ah--I see," [with a bright smile]--"Train, you mean--not Taine.  George

Francis Train.  No, ma'm we--"



"I mean Taine--if I may take the liberty."



The clerk reflected again--then:



"Taine .  .  .  .  Taine .  .  .  . Is it hymns?"



"No, it isn't hymns.  It is a volume that is making a deal of talk just

now, and is very widely known--except among parties who sell it."



The clerk glanced at her face to see if a sarcasm might not lurk

somewhere in that obscure speech, but the gentle simplicity of the

beautiful eyes that met his, banished that suspicion.  He went away and

conferred with the proprietor.  Both appeared to be non-plussed.  They

thought and talked, and talked and thought by turns.  Then both came

forward and the proprietor said:



"Is it an American book, ma'm?"



"No, it is an American reprint of an English translation."



"Oh!  Yes--yes--I remember, now.  We are expecting it every day.  It

isn't out yet."



"I think you must be mistaken, because you advertised it a week ago."



"Why no--can that be so?"



"Yes, I am sure of it.  And besides, here is the book itself, on the

counter."



She bought it and the proprietor retired from the field.  Then she asked

the clerk for the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table--and was pained to see

the admiration her beauty had inspired in him fade out of his face.

He said with cold dignity, that cook books were somewhat out of their

line, but be would order it if she desired it.  She said, no, never mind.

Then she fell to conning the titles again, finding a delight in the

inspection of the Hawthornes, the Longfellows, the Tennysons, and other

favorites of her idle hours.  Meantime the clerk's eyes were busy, and no

doubt his admiration was returning again--or may be he was only gauging

her probable literary tastes by some sagacious system of admeasurement

only known to his guild.  Now he began to "assist" her in making a

selection; but his efforts met with no success--indeed they only annoyed

her and unpleasantly interrupted her meditations.  Presently, while she

was holding a copy of "Venetian Life" in her hand and running over a

familiar passage here and there, the clerk said, briskly, snatching up a

paper-covered volume and striking the counter a smart blow with it to

dislodge the dust:



"Now here is a work that we've sold a lot of.  Everybody that's read it

likes it"--and he intruded it under her nose; "it's a book that I can

recommend--'The Pirate's Doom, or the Last of the Buccaneers.'  I think

it's one of the best things that's come out this season."



Laura pushed it gently aside her hand and went on and went on filching

from "Venetian Life."



"I believe I do not want it," she said.



The clerk hunted around awhile, glancing at one title and then another,

but apparently not finding what he wanted.



However, he succeeded at last.  Said he:



"Have you ever read this, ma'm?  I am sure you'll like it.  It's by the

author of 'The Hooligans of Hackensack.' It is full of love troubles and

mysteries and all sorts of such things.  The heroine strangles her own

mother.  Just glance at the title please,--'Gonderil the Vampire, or The

Dance of Death.'  And here is 'The Jokist's Own Treasury, or, The Phunny

Phellow's Bosom Phriend.'  The funniest thing!--I've read it four times,

ma'm, and I can laugh at the very sight of it yet.  And 'Gonderil,'--

I assure you it is the most splendid book I ever read.  I know you will

like these books, ma'm, because I've read them myself and I know what

they are."



"Oh, I was perplexed--but I see how it is, now.  You must have thought

I asked you to tell me what sort of books I wanted--for I am apt to say

things which I don't really mean, when I am absent minded.  I suppose I

did ask you, didn't I?"



"No ma'm,--but I--"



"Yes, I must have done it, else you would not have offered your services,

for fear it might be rude.  But don't be troubled--it was all my fault.

I ought not to have been so heedless--I ought not to have asked you."



"But you didn't ask me, ma'm.  We always help customers all we can.

You see our experience--living right among books all the time--that sort

of thing makes us able to help a customer make a selection, you know."



"Now does it, indeed?  It is part of your business, then?"



"Yes'm, we always help."



"How good it is of you.  Some people would think it rather obtrusive,

perhaps, but I don't--I think it is real kindness--even charity.  Some

people jump to conclusions without any thought--you have noticed that?"



"O yes," said the clerk, a little perplexed as to whether to feel

comfortable or the reverse; "Oh yes, indeed, I've often noticed that,

ma'm."



"Yes, they jump to conclusions with an absurd heedlessness.  Now some

people would think it odd that because you, with the budding tastes and

the innocent enthusiasms natural to your time of life, enjoyed the

Vampires and the volume of nursery jokes, you should imagine that an

older person would delight in them too--but I do not think it odd at all.

I think it natural--perfectly natural in you.  And kind, too.  You look

like a person who not only finds a deep pleasure in any little thing in

the way of literature that strikes you forcibly, but is willing and glad

to share that pleasure with others--and that, I think, is noble and

admirable--very noble and admirable.  I think we ought all--to share our

pleasures with others, and do what we can to make each other happy, do

not you?"



"Oh, yes.  Oh, yes, indeed.  Yes, you are quite right, ma'm."



But he was getting unmistakably uncomfortable, now, notwithstanding

Laura's confiding sociability and almost affectionate tone.



"Yes, indeed.  Many people would think that what a bookseller--or perhaps

his clerk--knows about literature as literature, in contradistinction to

its character as merchandise, would hardly, be of much assistance to a

person--that is, to an adult, of course--in the selection of food for the

mind--except of course wrapping paper, or twine, or wafers, or something

like that--but I never feel that way.  I feel that whatever service you

offer me, you offer with a good heart, and I am as grateful for it as if

it were the greatest boon to me.  And it is useful to me--it is bound to

be so.  It cannot be otherwise.  If you show me a book which you have

read--not skimmed over or merely glanced at, but read--and you tell me

that you enjoyed it and that you could read it three or four times, then

I know what book I want--"



"Thank you!--th--"



--"to avoid.  Yes indeed.  I think that no information ever comes amiss

in this world.  Once or twice I have traveled in the cars--and there you

know, the peanut boy always measures you with his eye, and hands you out

a book of murders if you are fond of theology; or Tupper or a dictionary

or T. S. Arthur if you are fond of poetry; or he hands you a volume of

distressing jokes or a copy of the American Miscellany if you

particularly dislike that sort of literary fatty degeneration of the

heart--just for the world like a pleasant spoken well-meaning gentleman

in any, bookstore.  But here I am running on as if business men had

nothing to do but listen to women talk.  You must pardon me, for I was

not thinking.--And you must let me thank you again for helping me.

I read a good deal, and shall be in nearly every day and I would be sorry

to have you think me a customer who talks too much and buys too little.

Might I ask you to give me the time?  Ah-two-twenty-two.  Thank you

very much.  I will set mine while I have the opportunity."



But she could not get her watch open, apparently.  She tried, and tried

again.  Then the clerk, trembling at his own audacity, begged to be

allowed to assist.  She allowed him.  He succeeded, and was radiant under

the sweet influences of her pleased face and her seductively worded

acknowledgements with gratification.  Then he gave her the exact time

again, and anxiously watched her turn the hands slowly till they reached

the precise spot without accident or loss of life, and then he looked as

happy as a man who had helped a fellow being through a momentous

undertaking, and was grateful to know that he had not lived in vain.

Laura thanked him once more.  The words were music to his ear; but what

were they compared to the ravishing smile with which she flooded his

whole system?  When she bowed her adieu and turned away, he was no longer

suffering torture in the pillory where she had had him trussed up during

so many distressing moments, but he belonged to the list of her conquests

and was a flattered and happy thrall, with the dawn-light of love

breaking over the eastern elevations of his heart.



It was about the hour, now, for the chairman of the House Committee on

Benevolent Appropriations to make his appearance, and Laura stepped to

the door to reconnoiter.  She glanced up the street, and sure enough--









CHAPTER XXXVII.





That Chairman was nowhere in sight.  Such disappointments seldom occur in

novels, but are always happening in real life.



She was obliged to make a new plan.  She sent him a note, and asked him

to call in the evening--which he did.



She received the Hon. Mr. Buckstone with a sunny smile, and said:



"I don't know how I ever dared to send you a note, Mr. Buckstone, for you

have the reputation of not being very partial to our sex."



"Why I am sure my, reputation does me wrong, then, Miss Hawkins.  I have

been married once--is that nothing in my favor?"



"Oh, yes--that is, it may be and it may not be.  If you have known what

perfection is in woman, it is fair to argue that inferiority cannot

interest you now."



"Even if that were the case it could not affect you, Miss Hawkins," said

the chairman gallantly.  "Fame does not place you in the list of ladies

who rank below perfection."  This happy speech delighted Mr. Buckstone as

much as it seemed to delight Laura.  But it did not confuse him as much

as it apparently did her.



"I wish in all sincerity that I could be worthy of such a felicitous

compliment as that.  But I am a woman, and so I am gratified for it just

as it is, and would not have it altered."



"But it is not merely a compliment--that is, an empty complement--it is

the truth.  All men will endorse that."



Laura looked pleased, and said:



"It is very kind of you to say it.  It is a distinction indeed, for a

country-bred girl like me to be so spoken of by people of brains and

culture.  You are so kind that I know you will pardon my putting you to

the trouble to come this evening."



"Indeed it was no trouble.  It was a pleasure.  I am alone in the world

since I lost my wife, and I often long for the society of your sex, Miss

Hawkins, notwithstanding what people may say to the contrary."



"It is pleasant to hear you say that.  I am sure it must be so.  If I

feel lonely at times, because of my exile from old friends, although

surrounded by new ones who are already very dear to me, how much more

lonely must you feel, bereft as you are, and with no wholesome relief

from the cares of state that weigh you down.  For your own sake, as well

as for the sake of others, you ought to go into society oftener.

I seldom see you at a reception, and when I do you do not usually give me

very, much of your attention"



"I never imagined that you wished it or I would have been very glad to

make myself happy in that way.--But one seldom gets an opportunity to say

more than a sentence to you in a place like that.  You are always the

centre of a group--a fact which you may have noticed yourself.  But if

one might come here--"



"Indeed you would always find a hearty welcome, Mr. Buckstone.  I have

often wished you would come and tell me more about Cairo and the

Pyramids, as you once promised me you would."



"Why, do you remember that yet, Miss Hawkins?  I thought ladies' memories

were more fickle than that."



"Oh, they are not so fickle as gentlemen's promises.  And besides, if I

had been inclined to forget, I--did you not give me something by way of a

remembrancer?"



"Did I?"



"Think."



"It does seem to me that I did; but I have forgotten what it was now."



"Never, never call a lady's memory fickle again!  Do you recognize this?"



"A little spray of box!  I am beaten--I surrender.  But have you kept

that all this time?"



Laura's confusion was very, pretty.  She tried to hide it, but the more

she tried the more manifest it became and withal the more captivating to

look upon.  Presently she threw the spray of box from her with an annoyed

air, and said:



"I forgot myself.  I have been very foolish.  I beg that you will forget

this absurd thing."



Mr. Buckstone picked up the spray, and sitting down by Laura's side on

the sofa, said:



"Please let me keep it, Miss Hawkins.  I set a very high value upon it

now."



"Give it to me, Mr. Buckstone, and do not speak so.  I have been

sufficiently punished for my thoughtlessness.  You cannot take pleasure

in adding to my distress.  Please give it to me."



"Indeed I do not wish to distress you.  But do not consider the matter so

gravely; you have done yourself no wrong.  You probably forgot that you

had it; but if you had given it to me I would have kept it--and not

forgotten it."



"Do not talk so, Mr. Buckstone.  Give it to me, please, and forget the

matter."



"It would not be kind to refuse, since it troubles you so, and so I

restore it.  But if you would give me part of it and keep the rest--"



"So that you might have something to remind you of me when you wished to

laugh at my foolishness?"



"Oh, by no means, no!  Simply that I might remember that I had once

assisted to discomfort you, and be reminded to do so no more."



Laura looked up, and scanned his face a moment.  She was about to break

the twig, but she hesitated and said:



"If I were sure that you--"She threw the spray away, and continued:

"This is silly!  We will change the subject.  No, do not insist--I must

have my way in this."



Then Mr. Buckstone drew off his forces and proceeded to make a wily

advance upon the fortress under cover of carefully--contrived artifices

and stratagems of war.  But he contended with an alert and suspicious

enemy; and so at the end of two hours it was manifest to him that he had

made but little progress.  Still, he had made some; he was sure of that.



Laura sat alone and communed with herself;



"He is fairly hooked, poor thing.  I can play him at my leisure and land

him when I choose.  He was all ready to be caught, days and days ago--

I saw that, very well.  He will vote for our bill--no fear about that;

and moreover he will work for it, too, before I am done with him.  If he

had a woman's eyes he would have noticed that the spray of box had grown

three inches since he first gave it to me, but a man never sees anything

and never suspects.  If I had shown him a whole bush he would have

thought it was the same.  Well, it is a good night's work: the committee

is safe.  But this is a desperate game I am playing in these days--

a wearing, sordid, heartless game.  If I lose, I lose everything--even

myself.  And if I win the game, will it be worth its cost after all?

I do not know.  Sometimes I doubt.  Sometimes I half wish I had not

begun.  But no matter; I have begun, and I will never turn back; never

while I live."



Mr. Buckstone indulged in a reverie as he walked homeward:



"She is shrewd and deep, and plays her cards with considerable

discretion--but she will lose, for all that.  There is no hurry; I shall

come out winner, all in good time.  She is the most beautiful woman in

the world; and she surpassed herself to-night.  I suppose I must vote for

that bill, in the end maybe; but that is not a matter of much consequence

the government can stand it.  She is bent on capturing me, that is plain;

but she will find by and by that what she took for a sleeping garrison

was an ambuscade."









CHAPTER XXXVIII.



          Now this surprising news caus'd her fall in 'a trance,

          Life as she were dead, no limbs she could advance,

          Then her dear brother came, her from the ground he took

          And she spake up and said, O my poor heart is broke.



                              The Barnardcastle Tragedy.



"Don't you think he is distinguished looking?"



"What! That gawky looking person, with Miss Hawkins?"



"There.  He's just speaking to Mrs. Schoonmaker.  Such high-bred

negligence and unconsciousness.  Nothing studied.  See his fine eyes."



"Very.  They are moving this way now.  Maybe he is coming here.  But he

looks as helpless as a rag baby.  Who is he, Blanche?"



"Who is he?  And you've been here a week, Grace, and don't know?  He's

the catch of the season.  That's Washington Hawkins--her brother."



"No, is it?"



"Very old family, old Kentucky family I believe.  He's got enormous

landed property in Tennessee, I think.  The family lost everything,

slaves and that sort of thing, you know, in the war.  But they have a

great deal of land, minerals, mines and all that.  Mr. Hawkins and his

sister too are very much interested in the amelioration of the condition

of the colored race; they have some plan, with Senator Dilworthy, to

convert a large part of their property to something another for the

freedmen."



"You don't say so?  I thought he was some guy from Pennsylvania.  But he

is different from others.  Probably he has lived all his life on his

plantation."



It was a day reception of Mrs. Representative Schoonmaker, a sweet woman,

of simple and sincere manners.  Her house was one of the most popular in

Washington.  There was less ostentation there than in some others, and

people liked to go where the atmosphere reminded them of the peace and

purity of home.  Mrs. Schoonmaker was as natural and unaffected in

Washington society as she was in her own New York house, and kept up the

spirit of home-life there, with her husband and children.  And that was

the reason, probably, why people of refinement liked to go there.



Washington is a microcosm, and one can suit himself with any sort of

society within a radius of a mile.  To a large portion of the people who

frequent Washington or dwell where, the ultra fashion, the shoddy, the

jobbery are as utterly distasteful as they would he in a refined New

England City.  Schoonmaker was not exactly a leader in the House, but he

was greatly respected for his fine talents and his honesty.  No one would

have thought of offering to carry National Improvement Directors Relief

stock for him.



These day receptions were attended by more women than men, and those

interested in the problem might have studied the costumes of the ladies

present, in view of this fact, to discover whether women dress more for

the eyes of women or for effect upon men.  It is a very important

problem, and has been a good deal discussed, and its solution would form

one fixed, philosophical basis, upon which to estimate woman's character.

We are inclined to take a medium ground, and aver that woman dresses to

please herself, and in obedience to a law of her own nature.



"They are coming this way," said Blanche.  People who made way for them

to pass, turned to look at them.  Washington began to feel that the eyes

of the public were on him also, and his eyes rolled about, now towards

the ceiling, now towards the floor, in an effort to look unconscious.



"Good morning, Miss Hawkins.  Delighted.  Mr. Hawkins.  My friend, Miss

Medlar."



Mr. Hawkins, who was endeavoring to square himself for a bow, put his

foot through the train of Mrs. Senator Poplin, who looked round with a

scowl, which turned into a smile as she saw who it was.  In extricating

himself, Mr. Hawkins, who had the care of his hat as well as the

introduction on his mind, shambled against Miss Blanche, who said pardon,

with the prettiest accent, as if the awkwardness were her own.  And Mr.

Hawkins righted himself.



"Don't you find it very warm to-day, Mr. Hawkins?" said Blanche, by way

of a remark.



It's awful hot," said Washington.



"It's warm for the season," continued Blanche pleasantly.  "But I suppose

you are accustomed to it," she added, with a general idea that the

thermometer always stands at 90 deg. in all parts of the late slave

states.  "Washington weather generally cannot be very congenial to you?"



"It's congenial," said Washington brightening up, "when it's not

congealed."



"That's very good.  Did you hear, Grace, Mr. Hawkins says it's congenial

when it's not congealed."



"What is, dear?" said Grace, who was talking with Laura.



The conversation was now finely under way.  Washington launched out an

observation of his own.



"Did you see those Japs, Miss Leavitt?"



"Oh, yes, aren't they queer.  But so high-bred, so picturesque.  Do you

think that color makes any difference, Mr. Hawkins?  I used to be so

prejudiced against color."



"Did you?  I never was.  I used to think my old mammy was handsome."



"How interesting your life must have been!  I should like to hear about

it."



Washington was about settling himself into his narrative style,

when Mrs. Gen. McFingal caught his eye.



"Have you been at the Capitol to-day, Mr. Hawkins?"



Washington had not.  "Is anything uncommon going on?"



"They say it was very exciting.  The Alabama business you know.

Gen.  Sutler, of Massachusetts, defied England, and they say he wants

war."



"He wants to make himself conspicuous more like," said Laura.

"He always, you have noticed, talks with one eye on the gallery, while

the other is on the speaker."



"Well, my husband says, its nonsense to talk of war, and wicked.

He knows what war is.  If we do have war, I hope it will be for the

patriots of Cuba.  Don't you think we want Cuba, Mr. Hawkins?"



"I think we want it bad," said Washington.  "And Santo Domingo.  Senator

Dilworthy says, we are bound to extend our religion over the isles of the

sea.  We've got to round out our territory, and--"



Washington's further observations were broken off by Laura, who whisked

him off to another part of the room, and reminded him that they must make

their adieux.



"How stupid and tiresome these people are," she said.  "Let's go."



They were turning to say good-by to the hostess, when Laura's attention

was arrested by the sight of a gentleman  who was just speaking to Mrs.

Schoonmaker.  For a second her heart stopped beating.  He was a handsome

man of forty and perhaps more, with grayish hair and whiskers, and he

walked with a cane, as if he were slightly lame.  He might be less than

forty, for his face was worn into hard lines, and he was pale.



No.  It could not be, she said to herself.  It is only a resemblance.

But as the gentleman turned and she saw his full face, Laura put out her

hand and clutched Washington's arm to prevent herself from falling.



Washington, who was not minding anything, as usual, looked 'round in

wonder.  Laura's eyes were blazing fire and hatred; he had never seen her

look so before; and her face, was livid.



"Why, what is it, sis?  Your face is as white as paper."



"It's he, it's he.  Come, come," and she dragged him away.



"It's who?" asked Washington, when they had gained the carriage.



"It's nobody, it's nothing.  Did I say he?  I was faint with the heat.

Don't mention it.  Don't you speak of it," she added earnestly, grasping

his arm.



When she had gained her room she went to the glass and saw a pallid and

haggard face.



"My God," she cried, "this will never do.  I should have killed him, if I

could.  The scoundrel still lives, and dares to come here.  I ought to

kill him.  He has no right to live.  How I hate him.  And yet I loved

him.  Oh heavens, how I did love that man.  And why didn't he kill me?

He might better.  He did kill all that was good in me.  Oh, but he shall

not escape.  He shall not escape this time.  He may have forgotten.  He

will find that a woman's hate doesn't forget.  The law?  What would the

law do but protect him and make me an outcast?  How all Washington would

gather up its virtuous skirts and avoid me, if it knew.  I wonder if he

hates me as I do him?"



So Laura raved, in tears and in rage by turns, tossed in a tumult of

passion, which she gave way to with little effort to control.



A servant came to summon her to dinner.  She had a headache.  The hour

came for the President's reception.  She had a raving headache, and the

Senator must go without her.



That night of agony was like another night she recalled.  How vividly it

all came back to her.  And at that time she remembered she thought she

might be mistaken.  He might come back to her.  Perhaps he loved her,

a little, after all.  Now, she knew he did not.  Now, she knew he was a

cold-blooded scoundrel, without pity.  Never a word in all these years.

She had hoped he was dead.  Did his wife live, she wondered.  She caught

at that--and it gave a new current to her thoughts.  Perhaps, after all--

she must see him.  She could not live without seeing him.  Would he smile

as in the old days when she loved him so; or would he sneer as when she

last saw him?  If be looked so, she hated him.  If he should call her

"Laura, darling," and look SO!  She must find him.  She must end her

doubts.



Laura kept her room for two days, on one excuse and another--a nervous

headache, a cold--to the great anxiety of the Senator's household.

Callers, who went away, said she had been too gay--they did not say

"fast," though some of them may have thought it.  One so conspicuous and

successful in society as Laura could not be out of the way two days,

without remarks being made, and not all of them complimentary.



When she came down she appeared as usual, a little pale may be, but

unchanged in manner.  If there were any deepened lines about the eyes

they had been concealed.  Her course of action was quite determined.



At breakfast she asked if any one had heard any unusual noise during the

night?  Nobody had.  Washington never heard any noise of any kind after

his eyes were shut.  Some people thought he never did when they were open

either.



Senator Dilworthy said he had come in late.  He was detained in a little

consultation after the Congressional prayer meeting.  Perhaps it was his

entrance.



No, Laura said.  She heard that.  It was later.  She might have been

nervous, but she fancied somebody was trying to get into the house.



Mr. Brierly humorously suggested that it might be, as none of the members

were occupied in night session.



The Senator frowned, and said he did not like to hear that kind of

newspaper slang.  There might be burglars about.



Laura said that very likely it was only her nervousness.  But she thought

she world feel safer if Washington would let her take one of his pistols.

Washington brought her one of his revolvers, and instructed her in the

art of loading and firing it.



During the morning Laura drove down to Mrs. Schoonmaker's to pay a

friendly call.



"Your receptions are always delightful," she said to that lady, "the

pleasant people all seem to come here."



"It's pleasant to hear you say so, Miss Hawkins.  I believe my friends

like to come here.  Though society in Washington is mixed; we have a

little of everything."



"I suppose, though, you don't see much of the old rebel element?" said

Laura with a smile.



If this seemed to Mrs. Schoonmaker a singular remark for a lady to make,

who was meeting "rebels" in society every day, she did not express it in

any way, but only said,



"You know we don't say 'rebel' anymore.  Before we came to Washington I

thought rebels would look unlike other people.  I find we are very much

alike, and that kindness and good nature wear away prejudice.  And then

you know there are all sorts of common interests.  My husband sometimes

says that he doesn't see but confederates are just as eager to get at the

treasury as Unionists.  You know that Mr. Schoonmaker is on the

appropriations."



"Does he know many Southerners?"



"Oh, yes.  There were several at my reception the other day.  Among

others a confederate Colonel--a stranger--handsome man with gray hair,

probably you didn't notice him, uses a cane in walking.  A very agreeable

man.  I wondered why he called.  When my husband came home and looked

over the cards, he said he had a cotton claim.  A real southerner.

Perhaps you might know him if I could think of his name.  Yes, here's his

card--Louisiana."



Laura took the card, looked at it intently till she was sure of the

address, and then laid it down, with,



"No, he is no friend of ours."



That afternoon, Laura wrote and dispatched the following note.  It was in

a round hand, unlike her flowing style, and it was directed to a number

and street in Georgetown:--



     "A Lady at Senator Dilworthy's would like to see Col. George Selby,

     on business connected with the Cotton Claims.  Can he call Wednesday

     at three o'clock P. M.?"



On Wednesday at 3 P. M, no one of the family was likely to be in the

house except Laura.









CHAPTER XXXIX.



Col. Selby had just come to Washington, and taken lodgings in Georgetown.

His business was to get pay for some cotton that was destroyed during the

war.  There were many others in Washington on the same errand, some of

them with claims as difficult to establish as his.  A concert of action

was necessary, and he was not, therefore, at all surprised to receive the

note from a lady asking him to call at Senator Dilworthy's.



At a little after three on Wednesday he rang the bell of the Senator's

residence.  It was a handsome mansion on the Square opposite the

President's house.  The owner must be a man of great wealth, the Colonel

thought; perhaps, who knows, said he with a smile, he may have got some

of my cotton in exchange for salt and quinine after the capture of New

Orleans.  As this thought passed through his mind he was looking at the

remarkable figure of the Hero of New Orleans, holding itself by main

strength from sliding off the back of the rearing bronze horse, and

lifting its hat in the manner of one who acknowledges the playing of that

martial air: "See, the Conquering Hero Comes!"  "Gad," said the Colonel

to himself, "Old Hickory ought to get down and give his seat to Gen.

Sutler--but they'd have to tie him on."



Laura was in the drawing room.  She heard the bell, she heard the steps

in the hall, and the emphatic thud of the supporting cane.  She had risen

from her chair and was leaning against the piano, pressing her left hand

against the violent beating of her heart.  The door opened and the

Colonel entered, standing in the full light of the opposite window.

Laura was more in the shadow and stood for an instant, long enough for

the Colonel to make the inward observation that she was a magnificent

Woman.  She then advanced a step.



"Col. Selby, is it not?"



The Colonel staggered back, caught himself by a chair, and turned towards

her a look of terror.



"Laura?  My God!"



"Yes, your wife!"



"Oh, no, it can't be.  How came you here?  I thought you were--"



"You thought I was dead?  You thought you were rid of me?  Not so long as

you live, Col. Selby, not so long as you live;" Laura in her passion was

hurried on to say.



No man had ever accused Col. Selby of cowardice.  But he was a coward

before this woman.  May be he was not the man he once was.  Where was his

coolness?  Where was his sneering, imperturbable manner, with which he

could have met, and would have met, any woman he had wronged, if he had

only been forewarned.  He felt now that he must temporize, that he must

gain time.  There was danger in Laura's tone.  There was something

frightful in her calmness.  Her steady eyes seemed to devour him.



"You have ruined my life," she said; "and I was so young, so ignorant,

and loved you so.  You betrayed me, and left me mocking me and trampling

me into the dust, a soiled cast-off.  You might better have killed me

then.  Then I should not have hated you."



"Laura," said the Colonel, nerving himself, but still pale, and speaking

appealingly, "don't say that.  Reproach me.  I deserve it.  I was a

scoundrel.  I was everything monstrous.  But your beauty made me crazy.

You are right.  I was a brute in leaving you as I did.  But what could I

do?  I was married, and--"



"And your wife still lives?" asked Laura, bending a little forward in her

eagerness.



The Colonel noticed the action, and he almost said "no," but he thought

of the folly of attempting concealment.



"Yes.  She is here."



What little color had wandered back into Laura's face forsook it again.

Her heart stood still, her strength seemed going from her limbs.  Her

last hope was gone.  The room swam before her for a moment, and the

Colonel stepped towards her, but she waved him back, as hot anger again

coursed through her veins, and said,



"And you dare come with her, here, and tell me of it, here and mock me

with it!  And you think I will have it; George?  You think I will let you

live with that woman?  You think I am as powerless as that day I fell

dead at your feet?"



She raged now.  She was in a tempest of excitement.  And she advanced

towards him with a threatening mien.  She would kill me if she could,

thought the Colonel; but he thought at the same moment, how beautiful she

is.  He had recovered his head now.  She was lovely when he knew her,

then a simple country girl, Now she was dazzling, in the fullness of ripe

womanhood, a superb creature, with all the fascination that a woman of

the world has for such a man as Col. Selby.  Nothing of this was lost on

him.  He stepped quickly to her, grasped both her hands in his, and said,



"Laura, stop!  think!  Suppose I loved you yet!  Suppose I hated my fate!

What can I do?  I am broken by the war.  I have lost everything almost.

I had as lief be dead and done with it."



The Colonel spoke with a low remembered voice that thrilled through

Laura.  He was looking into her eyes as he had looked  in those old days,

when no birds of all those that sang in the groves where they walked sang

a note of warning.  He was wounded.  He had been punished.  Her strength

forsook her with her rage, and she sank upon a chair, sobbing,



"Oh!  my God, I thought I hated him!"



The Colonel knelt beside her.  He took her hand and she let him keep it.

She, looked down into his face, with a pitiable tenderness, and said in a

weak voice.



"And you do love me a little?"



The Colonel vowed and protested.  He kissed her hand and her lips.  He

swore his false soul into perdition.



She wanted love, this woman.  Was not her love for George Selby deeper

than any other woman's could be?  Had she not a right to him?  Did he

not belong to her by virtue of her overmastering passion?  His wife--she

was not his wife, except by the law.  She could not be.  Even with the

law she could have no right to stand between two souls that were one.

It was an infamous condition in society that George should be tied to

her.



Laura thought this, believed it; because she desired to believe it.  She

came to it as an original propositions founded an the requirements of her

own nature.  She may have heard, doubtless she had, similar theories that

were prevalent at that day, theories of the tyranny of marriage and of

the freedom of marriage.  She had even heard women lecturers say, that

marriage should only continue so long as it pleased either party to it--

for a year, or a month, or a day.  She had not given much heed to this,

but she saw its justice now in a dash of revealing desire.  It must be

right.  God would not have permitted her to love George Selby as she did,

and him to love her, if it was right for society to raise up a barrier

between them.  He belonged to her.  Had he not confessed it himself?



Not even the religious atmosphere of Senator Dilworthy's house had been

sufficient to instill into Laura that deep Christian principle which had

been somehow omitted in her training.  Indeed in that very house had she

not heard women, prominent before the country and besieging Congress,

utter sentiments that fully justified the course she was marking out for

herself.



They were seated now, side by side, talking with more calmness.  Laura

was happy, or thought she was.  But it was that feverish sort of

happiness which is snatched out of the black shadow of falsehood, and is

at the moment recognized as fleeting and perilous, and indulged

tremblingly.  She loved.  She was loved.  That is happiness certainly.

And the black past and the troubled present and the uncertain future

could not snatch that from her.



What did they say as they sat there?  What nothings do people usually say

in such circumstances, even if they are three-score and ten?  It was

enough for Laura to hear his voice and be near him.  It was enough for

him to be near her, and avoid committing himself as much as he could.

Enough for him was the present also.  Had there not always been some way

out of such scrapes?



And yet Laura could not be quite content without prying into tomorrow.

How could the Colonel manage to free himself from his wife?  Would it be

long?  Could he not go into some State where it would not take much time?

He could not say exactly.  That they must think of.  That they must talk

over.  And so on.  Did this seem like a damnable plot to Laura against

the life, maybe, of a sister, a woman like herself?  Probably not.

It was right that this man should be hers, and there were some obstacles

in the way.  That was all.  There are as good reasons for bad actions as

for good ones,--to those who commit them.  When one has broken the tenth

commandment, the others are not of much account.



Was it unnatural, therefore, that when George Selby departed, Laura

should watch him from the window, with an almost joyful heart as he went

down the sunny square?  "I shall see him to-morrow," she said," and the

next day, and the next.  He is mine now."



"Damn the woman," said the Colonel as he picked his way down the steps.

"Or," he added, as his thoughts took a new turn, "I wish my wife was in

New Orleans."









CHAPTER XL.



          Open your ears; for which of you will stop,

          The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?

          I, from the orient to the drooping west,

          Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold

          The acts commenced on this ball of earth:

          Upon my tongues continual slanders ride;

          The which in every, language I pronounce,

          Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.



                                             King Henry IV.



As may be readily believed, Col. Beriah Sellers was by this time one of

the best known men in Washington.  For the first time in his life his

talents had a fair field.



He was now at the centre of the manufacture of gigantic schemes,

of speculations of all sorts, of political and social gossip.

The atmosphere was full of little and big rumors and of vast, undefined

expectations.  Everybody was in haste, too, to push on his private plan,

and feverish in his haste, as if in constant apprehension that tomorrow

would be Judgment Day.  Work while Congress is in session, said the

uneasy spirit, for in the recess there is no work and no device.



The Colonel enjoyed this bustle and confusion amazingly; he thrived in

the air of-indefinite expectation.  All his own schemes took larger shape

and more misty and majestic proportions; and in this congenial air, the

Colonel seemed even to himself to expand into something large and

mysterious.  If he respected himself before, he almost worshipped Beriah

Sellers now, as a superior being.  If he could have chosen an official

position out of the highest, he would have been embarrassed in the

selection.  The presidency of the republic seemed too limited and cramped

in the constitutional restrictions.  If he could have been Grand Llama of

the United States, that might have come the nearest to his idea of a

position.  And next to that he would have luxuriated in the irresponsible

omniscience of the Special Correspondent.



Col. Sellers knew the President very well, and had access to his presence

when officials were kept cooling their heels in the Waiting-room.  The

President liked to hear the Colonel talk, his voluble ease was a

refreshment after the decorous dullness of men who only talked business

and government, and everlastingly expounded their notions of justice and

the distribution of patronage.  The Colonel was as much a lover of

farming and of horses as Thomas Jefferson was.  He talked to the

President by the hour about his magnificent stud, and his plantation at

Hawkeye, a kind of principality--he represented it.  He urged the

President to pay him a visit during the recess, and see his stock farm.



"The President's table is well enough," he used to say, to the loafers

who gathered about him at Willard's, "well enough for a man on a salary,

but God bless my soul, I should like him to see a little old-fashioned

hospitality--open house, you know.  A person seeing me at home might

think I paid no attention to what was in the house, just let things flow

in and out.  He'd be mistaken.  What I look to is quality, sir.  The

President has variety enough, but the quality!  Vegetables of course you

can't expect here.  I'm very particular about mine.  Take celery, now--

there's only one spot in this country where celery will grow.  But I an

surprised about the wines.  I should think they were manufactured in the

New York Custom House.  I must send the President some from my cellar.

I was really mortified the other day at dinner to see Blacque Bey leave

his standing in the glasses."



When the Colonel first came to Washington he had thoughts of taking the

mission to Constantinople, in order to be on the spot to look after the

dissemination, of his Eye Water, but as that invention; was not yet quite

ready, the project shrank a little in the presence of vaster schemes.

Besides he felt that he could do the country more good by remaining at

home.  He was one of the Southerners who were constantly quoted as

heartily "accepting the situation."



"I'm whipped," he used to say with a jolly laugh, "the government was too

many for me; I'm cleaned out, done for, except my plantation and private

mansion.  We played for a big thing, and lost it, and I don't whine, for

one.  I go for putting the old flag on all the vacant lots.  I said to

the President, says I, 'Grant, why don't you take Santo Domingo, annex

the whole thing, and settle the bill afterwards.  That's my way.  I'd,

take the job to manage Congress.  The South would come into it.  You've

got to conciliate the South, consolidate the two debts, pay 'em off in

greenbacks, and go ahead.  That's my notion.  Boutwell's got the right

notion about the value of paper, but he lacks courage. I should like to

run the treasury department about six months.  I'd make things plenty,

and business look up.'"



The Colonel had access to the departments.  He knew all the senators and

representatives, and especially, the lobby.  He was consequently a great

favorite in Newspaper Row, and was often lounging in the offices there,

dropping bits of private, official information, which were immediately,

caught up and telegraphed all over the country.  But it need to surprise

even the Colonel when he read it, it was embellished to that degree that

he hardly recognized it, and the hint was not lost on him.  He began to

exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper

demand.



People used to wonder in the winters of 187- and 187-, where the

"Specials" got that remarkable information with which they every morning

surprised the country, revealing the most secret intentions of the

President and his cabinet, the private thoughts of political leaders,

the hidden meaning of every movement.  This information was furnished by

Col. Sellers.



When he was asked, afterwards, about the stolen copy of the Alabama

Treaty which got into the "New York Tribune," he only looked mysterious,

and said that neither he nor Senator Dilworthy knew anything about it.

But those whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost

certain that he did know.



It must not be supposed that the Colonel in his general patriotic labors

neglected his own affairs.  The Columbus River Navigation Scheme absorbed

only a part of his time, so he was enabled to throw quite a strong

reserve force of energy into the Tennessee Land plan, a vast enterprise

commensurate with his abilities, and in the prosecution of which he was

greatly aided by Mr. Henry Brierly, who was buzzing about the capitol and

the hotels day and night, and making capital for it in some mysterious

way.



"We must create, a public opinion," said Senator Dilworthy.  "My only

interest in it is a public one, and if the country wants the institution,

Congress will have to yield."



It may have been after a conversation between the Colonel and Senator

Dilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a New York

newspaper:



     "We understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to

     the colored race that will, if successful, revolutionize the whole

     character of southern industry.  An experimental institution is in

     contemplation in Tennessee which will do for that state what the

     Industrial School at Zurich did for Switzerland.  We learn that

     approaches have been made to the heirs of the late Hon. Silas

     Hawkins of Missouri, in reference to a lease of a portion of their

     valuable property in East Tennessee.  Senator Dilworthy, it is

     understood, is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement that will not

     give the government absolute control.  Private interests must give

     way to the public good.  It is to be hoped that Col. Sellers, who

     represents the heirs, will be led to see the matter in this light."



When Washington Hawkins read this despatch, he went to the Colonel in

some anxiety.  He was for a lease, he didn't want to surrender anything.

What did he think the government would offer?  Two millions?



"May be three, may be four," said the Colonel, "it's worth more than the

bank of England."



"If they will not lease," said Washington, "let 'em make it two millions

for an undivided half.  I'm not going to throw it away, not the whole of

it."



Harry told the Colonel that they must drive the thing through, he

couldn't be dallying round Washington when Spring opened.  Phil wanted

him, Phil had a great thing on hand up in Pennsylvania.



"What is that?" inquired the Colonel, always ready to interest himself in

anything large.



"A mountain of coal; that's all.  He's going to run a tunnel into it in

the Spring."



"Does he want any capital?", asked the Colonel, in the tone of a man who

is given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment.



"No.  Old man Bolton's behind him.  He has capital, but I judged that he

wanted my experience in starting."



"If he wants me, tell him I'll come, after Congress adjourns.  I should

like to give him a little lift.  He lacks enterprise--now, about that

Columbus River.  He doesn't see his chances.  But he's a good fellow, and

you can tell him that Sellers won't go back on him."



"By the way," asked Harry, "who is that rather handsome party that's

hanging 'round Laura?  I see him with her everywhere, at the Capitol, in

the horse cars, and he comes to Dilworthy's.  If he weren't lame, I

should think he was going to run off with her."



"Oh, that's nothing.  Laura knows her business.  He has a cotton claim.

Used to be at Hawkeye during the war.



"Selby's his name, was a Colonel.  Got a wife and family.

Very respectable people, the Selby's."



"Well, that's all right," said Harry, "if it's business.  But if a woman

looked at me as I've seen her at Selby, I should understand it.  And it's

talked about, I can tell you."



Jealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman's observation.

Laura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she had

been the Queen of Sheba, on a royal visit to the great republic.  And he

resented it, and was "huffy" when he was with her, and ran her errands,

and brought her gossip, and bragged of his intimacy with the lovely

creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row.



Laura's life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and

fashionable dissipation.  She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest

set, and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that

began late and ended early.  If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about

appearances, she had a way of silencing him.  Perhaps she had some hold

on him, perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the

condition the tube colored race.



She saw Col. Selby, when the public knew and when it did not know.

She would see him, whatever excuses he made, and however he avoided her.

She was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy, which

alternately possessed her.  Sometimes she petted him, and coaxed him and

tried all her fascinations.  And again she threatened him and reproached

him.  What was he doing?  Why had he taken no steps to free himself?

Why didn't he send his wife home?  She should have money soon.

They could go to Europe--anywhere.  What did she care for talk?



And he promised, and lied, and invented fresh excuses for delay, like a

cowardly gambler and roue as he was, fearing to break with her, and half

the time unwilling to give her up.



"That woman doesn't know what fear is," he said to himself, "and she

watches me like a hawk."



He told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist, whom he had to tolerate

and use in getting through his claims, and that he should pay her and

have done with her, when he succeeded.









CHAPTER XLI.



Henry Brierly was at the Dilwortby's constantly and on such terms of

intimacy that he came and went without question.  The Senator was not an

inhospitable man, he liked to have guests in his house, and Harry's gay

humor and rattling way entertained him; for even the most devout men and

busy statesmen must have hours of relaxation.



Harry himself believed that he was of great service in the University

business, and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a great

degree.  He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator after

dinner.  He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth his

while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new

institution.



But it was not the Senator's society nor his dinners--at which this

scapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little wine--

which attracted him to the horse.  The fact was the poor fellow hung

around there day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five

minutes at a time.  For her presence at dinner he would endure the long

bore of the Senator's talk afterwards, while Laura was off at some

assembly, or excused herself on the plea of fatigue.  Now and then he

accompanied her to some reception, and rarely, on off nights, he was

blessed with her company in the parlor, when he sang, and was chatty and

vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and

ventriloquism, and made himself as entertaining as a man could be.



It puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for so

little with Laura; it was beyond his experience with women.  Sometimes

Laura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little, and took the trouble

to exert her powers of pleasing, and to entangle him deeper and deeper.

But this, it angered him afterwards to think, was in private; in public

she was beyond his reach, and never gave occasion to the suspicion that

she had any affair with him.  He was never permitted to achieve the

dignity of a serious flirtation with her in public.



"Why do you treat me so?" he once said, reproachfully.



"Treat you how?" asked Laura in a sweet voice, lifting her eyebrows.



"You know well enough.  You let other fellows monopolize you in society,

and you are as indifferent to me as if we were strangers."



"Can I help it if they are attentive, can I be rude?  But we are such old

friends, Mr. Brierly, that I didn't suppose you would be jealous."



"I think I must be a very old friend, then, by your conduct towards me.

By the same rule I should judge that Col. Selby must be very new."



Laura looked up quickly, as if about to return an indignant answer to

such impertinence, but she only said, "Well, what of Col. Selby, sauce-

box?"



"Nothing, probably, you'll care for.  Your being with him so much is the

town talk, that's all?"



"What do people say?" asked Laura calmly.



"Oh, they say a good many things.  You are offended, though, to have me

speak of it?"



"Not in the least.  You are my true friend.  I feel that I can trust you.

You wouldn't deceive me, Harry?"  throwing into her eyes a look of trust

and tenderness that melted away all his petulance and distrust.  "What do

they say?"



"Some say that you've lost your head about him; others that you don't

care any more for him than you do for a dozen others, but that he is

completely fascinated with you and about to desert his wife; and others

say it is nonsense to suppose you would entangle yourself with a married

man, and that your intimacy only arises from the matter of the cotton,

claims, for which he wants your influence with Dilworthy.  But you know

everybody is talked about more or less in Washington.  I shouldn't care;

but I wish you wouldn't have so much to do with Selby, Laura," continued

Harry, fancying that he was now upon such terms that his, advice, would

be heeded.



"And you believed these slanders?"



"I don't believe anything against you, Laura, but Col. Selby does not

mean you any good.  I know you wouldn't be seen with him if you knew his

reputation."



"Do you know him?"  Laura asked, as indifferently as she could.



"Only a little.  I was at his lodgings' in Georgetown a day or two ago,

with Col. Sellers.  Sellers wanted to talk with him about some patent

remedy he has, Eye Water, or something of that sort, which he wants to

introduce into Europe.  Selby is going abroad very soon."



Laura started; in spite of her self-control.



"And his wife!--Does he take his family?  Did you see his wife?"



"Yes.  A dark little woman, rather worn--must have been pretty once

though.  Has three or four children, one of them a baby.  They'll all

go of course.  She said she should be glad enough to get away from

Washington.  You know Selby has got his claim allowed, and they say he

has had a run, of luck lately at Morrissey's."



Laura heard all this in a kind of stupor, looking straight at Harry,

without seeing him.  Is it possible, she was thinking, that this base

wretch, after, all his promises, will take his wife and children and

leave me?  Is it possible the town is saying all these things about me?

And a look of bitterness coming into her face--does the fool think he can

escape so?



"You are angry with me, Laura," said Harry, not comprehending in the

least what was going on in her mind.



"Angry?" she said, forcing herself to come back to his presence.

"With you?  Oh no.  I'm angry with the cruel world, which, pursues an

independent woman as it never does a man.  I'm grateful to you Harry;

I'm grateful to you for telling me of that odious man."



And she rose from her chair and gave him her pretty hand, which the silly

fellow took, and kissed and clung to.  And he said many silly things,

before she disengaged herself gently, and left him, saying it was time to

dress, for dinner.



And Harry went away, excited, and a little hopeful, but only a little.

The happiness was only a gleam, which departed and left him thoroughly,

miserable.  She never would love him, and she was going to the devil,

besides.  He couldn't shut his eyes to what he saw, nor his ears to what

he heard of her.



What had come over this trilling young lady-killer?  It was a pity to see

such a gay butterfly broken on a wheel.  Was there something good in him,

after all, that had been touched?  He was in fact madly in love with this

woman.



It is not for us to analyze the passion and say whether it was a worthy

one.  It absorbed his whole nature and made him wretched enough.  If he

deserved punishment, what more would you have?  Perhaps this love was

kindling a new heroism in him.



He saw the road on which Laura was going clearly enough, though he did

not believe the worst he heard of her.  He  loved her too passionately to

credit that for a moment.  And it seemed to him that if he could compel

her to recognize her position, and his own devotion, she might love him,

and  that he could save her.  His love was so far ennobled, and become a

very different thing from its beginning in Hawkeye.  Whether he ever

thought that if he could save her from ruin, he could give her up

himself, is doubtful.  Such a pitch of virtue does not occur often in

real life, especially in such natures as Harry's, whose generosity and

unselfishness were matters of temperament rather than habits or

principles.



He wrote a long letter to Laura, an incoherent, passionate letter,

pouring out his love as he could not do in her presence, and warning her

as plainly as he dared of the dangers that surrounded her, and the risks

she ran of compromising herself in many ways.



Laura read the letter, with a little sigh may be, as she thought of other

days, but with contempt also, and she put it into the fire with the

thought, "They are all alike."



Harry was in the habit of writing to Philip freely, and boasting also

about his doings, as he could not help doing and remain himself.

Mixed up with his own exploits, and his daily triumphs as a lobbyist,

especially in the matter of the new University, in which Harry was to

have something handsome, were amusing sketches of Washington society,

hints about Dilworthy, stories about Col. Sellers, who had become a well-

known character, and wise remarks upon the machinery of private

legislation for the public-good, which greatly entertained Philip in his

convalescence.



Laura's name occurred very often in these letters, at first in casual

mention as the belle of the season, carrying everything before her with

her wit and beauty, and then more seriously, as if Harry did not exactly

like so much general admiration of her, and was a little nettled by her

treatment of him.



This was so different from Harry's usual tone about women, that Philip

wondered a good deal over it.  Could it be possible that he was seriously

affected?  Then came stories about Laura, town talk, gossip which Harry

denied the truth of indignantly; but he was evidently uneasy, and at

length wrote in such miserable spirits that Philip asked him squarely

what the trouble was; was he in love?



Upon this, Harry made a clean breast of it, and told Philip all he knew

about the Selby affair, and Laura's treatment of him, sometimes

encouraging him--and then throwing him off, and finally his belief that

she would go, to the bad if something was not done to arouse her from her

infatuation.  He wished Philip was in Washington.  He knew Laura, and she

had a great respect for his character, his opinions, his judgment.

Perhaps he, as an uninterested person whom she would have some

confidence, and as one of the public, could say some thing to her that

would show her where she stood.



Philip saw the situation clearly enough.  Of Laura he knew not much,

except that she was a woman of uncommon fascination, and he thought from

what he had seen of her in Hawkeye, her conduct towards him and towards

Harry, of not too much principle.  Of course he knew nothing of her

history; he knew nothing seriously against her, and if Harry was

desperately enamored of her, why should he not win her if he could.

If, however, she had already become what Harry uneasily felt she might

become, was it not his duty to go to the rescue of his friend and try to

save him from any rash act on account of a woman that might prove to be

entirely unworthy of him; for trifler and visionary as he was, Harry

deserved a better fate than this.



Philip determined to go to Washington and see for himself.  He had other

reasons also.  He began to know enough of Mr. Bolton's affairs to be

uneasy.  Pennybacker had been there several times during the winter, and

he suspected that he was involving Mr. Bolton in some doubtful scheme.

Pennybacker was in Washington, and Philip thought he might perhaps find

out something about him, and his plans, that would be of service to Mr.

Bolton.



Philip had enjoyed his winter very well, for a man with his arm broken

and his head smashed.  With two such nurses as Ruth and Alice, illness

seemed to him rather a nice holiday, and every moment of his

convalescence had been precious and all too fleeting.  With a young

fellow of the habits of Philip, such injuries cannot be counted on to

tarry long, even for the purpose of love-making, and Philip found himself

getting strong with even disagreeable rapidity.



During his first weeks of pain and weakness, Ruth was unceasing in her

ministrations; she quietly took charge of him, and with a gentle firmness

resisted all attempts of Alice or any one else to share to any great

extent the burden with her.  She was clear, decisive and peremptory in

whatever she did; but often when Philip, opened his eyes in those first

days of suffering and found her standing by his bedside, he saw a look of

tenderness in her anxious face that quickened his already feverish pulse,

a look that, remained in his heart long after he closed his eyes.

Sometimes he felt her hand on his forehead, and did not open his eyes for

fear she world take it away.  He watched for her coming to his chamber;

he could distinguish her light footstep from all others.  If this is what

is meant by women practicing medicine, thought Philip to himself, I like

it.



"Ruth," said he one day when he was getting to be quite himself,

"I believe in it?"



"Believe in what?"



"Why, in women physicians."



"Then, I'd better call in Mrs. Dr. Longstreet."



"Oh, no.  One will do, one at a time.  I think I should be well tomorrow,

if I thought I should never have any other."



"Thy physician thinks thee mustn't talk, Philip," said Ruth putting her

finger on his lips.



"But, Ruth, I want to tell you that I should wish I never had got well

if--"



"There, there, thee must not talk.  Thee is wandering again," and Ruth

closed his lips, with a smile on her own that broadened into a merry

laugh as she ran away.



Philip was not weary, however, of making these attempts, he rather

enjoyed it.  But whenever he inclined to be sentimental, Ruth would cut

him off, with some such gravely conceived speech as, "Does thee think

that thy physician will take advantage of the condition of a man who is

as weak as thee is?  I will call Alice, if thee has any dying confessions

to make."



As Philip convalesced, Alice more and more took Ruth's place as his

entertainer, and read to him by the hour, when he did not want to talk--

to talk about Ruth, as he did a good deal of the time.  Nor was this

altogether unsatisfactory to Philip.  He was always happy and contented

with Alice.  She was the most restful person he knew.  Better informed

than Ruth and with a much more varied culture, and bright and

sympathetic, he was never weary of her company, if he was not greatly

excited by it.  She had upon his mind that peaceful influence that Mrs.

Bolton had when, occasionally, she sat by his bedside with her work.

Some people have this influence, which is like an emanation.  They bring

peace to a house, they diffuse serene content in a room full of mixed

company, though they may say very little, and are apparently, unconscious

of their own power;



Not that Philip did not long for Ruth's presence all the same.  Since he

was well enough to be about the house, she was busy again with her

studies.  Now and then her teasing humor came again.  She always had a

playful shield against his sentiment.  Philip used sometimes to declare

that she had no sentiment; and then he doubted if he should be pleased

with her after all if she were at all sentimental; and he rejoiced that

she had, in such matters what he called the airy grace of sanity.  She

was the most gay serious person he ever saw.



Perhaps he waw not so much at rest or so contented with her as with

Alice.  But then he loved her.  And what have rest and contentment to do

with love?









CHAPTER XLIL



Mr. Buckstone's campaign was brief--much briefer than he supposed it

would be.  He began it purposing to win Laura without being won himself;

but his experience was that of all who had fought on that field before

him; he diligently continued his effort to win her, but he presently

found that while as yet he could not feel entirely certain of having won

her, it was very manifest that she had won him.  He had made an able

fight, brief as it was, and that at least was to his credit.  He was in

good company, now; he walked in a leash of conspicuous captives.  These

unfortunates followed Laura helplessly, for whenever she took a prisoner

he remained her slave henceforth.  Sometimes they chafed in their

bondage; sometimes they tore themselves free and said their serfdom was

ended; but sooner or later they always came back penitent and worshiping.

Laura pursued her usual course: she encouraged Mr. Buckstone by turns,

and by turns she harassed him; she exalted him to the clouds at one time,

and at another she dragged him down again.  She constituted him chief

champion of the Knobs University bill, and he accepted the position, at

first reluctantly, but later as a valued means of serving her--he even

came to look upon it as a piece of great good fortune, since it brought

him into such frequent contact with her.



Through him she learned that the Hon. Mr. Trollop was a bitter enemy of

her bill.  He urged her not to attempt to influence Mr. Trollop in any

way, and explained that whatever she might attempt in that direction

would surely be used against her and with damaging effect.



She at first said she knew Mr. Trollop, "and was aware that he had a

Blank-Blank;"--[**Her private figure of speech for Brother--or Son-in-

law]--but Mr. Buckstone said that he was not able to conceive what so

curious a phrase as Blank-Blank might mean, and had no wish to pry into

the matter, since it was probably private, he "would nevertheless venture

the blind assertion that nothing would answer in this particular case and

during this particular session but to be exceedingly wary and keep clear

away from Mr. Trollop; any other course would be fatal."



It seemed that nothing could be done.  Laura was seriously troubled.

Everything was looking well, and yet it was plain that one vigorous and

determined enemy might eventually succeed in overthrowing all her plans.

A suggestion came into her mind presently and she said:



"Can't you fight against his great Pension bill and, bring him to terms?"



"Oh, never; he and I are sworn brothers on that measure; we work in

harness and are very loving--I do everything I possibly can for him

there.  But I work with might and main against his Immigration bill,

--as pertinaciously and as vindictively, indeed, as he works against our

University.  We hate each other through half a conversation and are all

affection through the other half.  We understand each other.  He is an

admirable worker outside the capitol; he will do more for the Pension

bill than any other man could do; I wish he would make the great speech

on it which he wants to make--and then I would make another and we would

be safe."



"Well if he wants to make a great speech why doesn't he do it?"



Visitors interrupted the conversation and Mr. Buckstone took his leave.

It was not of the least moment to Laura that her question had not been

answered, inasmuch as it concerned a thing which did not interest her;

and yet, human being like, she thought she would have liked to know.

An opportunity occurring presently, she put the same question to another

person and got an answer that satisfied her.  She pondered a good while

that night, after she had gone to bed, and when she finally turned over,

to, go to sleep, she had thought out a new scheme.  The next evening at

Mrs. Gloverson's party, she said to Mr. Buckstone:



"I want Mr. Trollop to make his great speech on the Pension bill."



"Do you?  But you remember I was interrupted, and did not explain

to you--"



"Never mind, I know.  You must' make him make that speech.  I very.

particularly desire, it."



"Oh, it is easy, to say make him do it, but how am I to make him!"



"It is perfectly easy; I have thought it all out."



She then went into the details.  At length Mr. Buckstone said:



"I see now.  I can manage it, I am sure.  Indeed I wonder he never

thought of it himself--there are no end of precedents.  But how is this

going to benefit you, after I have managed it?  There is where the

mystery lies."



"But I will take care of that.  It will benefit me a great deal."



"I only wish I could see how; it is the oddest freak.  You seem to go the

furthest around to get at a thing--but you are in earnest, aren't you?"



"Yes I am, indeed."



"Very well, I will do it--but why not tell me how you imagine it is going

to help you?"



"I will, by and by.--Now there is nobody talking to him.  Go straight and

do it, there's a good fellow."



A moment or two later the two sworn friends of the Pension bill were

talking together, earnestly, and seemingly unconscious of the moving

throng about them.  They talked an hour, and then Mr. Buckstone came back

and said:



"He hardly fancied it at first, but he fell in love with it after a bit.

And we have made a compact, too.  I am to keep his secret and he is to

spare me, in future, when he gets ready to denounce the supporters of the

University bill--and I can easily believe he will keep his word on this

occasion."



A fortnight elapsed, and the University bill had gathered to itself many

friends, meantime.  Senator Dilworthy began to think the harvest was

ripe.  He conferred with Laura privately.  She was able to tell him

exactly how the House would vote.  There was a majority--the bill would

pass, unless weak members got frightened at the last, and deserted--a

thing pretty likely to occur.  The Senator said:



"I wish we had one more good strong man.  Now Trollop ought to be on our

side, for he is a friend of the negro.  But be is against us, and is our

bitterest opponent.  If he would simply vote No, but keep quiet and not

molest us, I would feel perfectly cheerful and content.  But perhaps

there is no use in thinking of that."



"Why I laid a little plan for his benefit two weeks ago.  I think he will

be tractable, maybe.  He is to come here tonight."



"Look out for him, my child!  He means mischief, sure.  It is said that

he claims to know of improper practices having been used in the interest

of this bill, and he thinks be sees a chance to make a great sensation

when the bill comes up.  Be wary.  Be very, very careful, my dear.

Do your very-ablest talking, now.  You can convince a man of anything,

when you try.  You must convince him that if anything improper has been

done, you at least are ignorant of it and sorry for it.  And if you could

only persuade him out of his hostility to the bill, too--but don't overdo

the thing; don't seem too anxious, dear."



"I won't; I'll be ever so careful.  I'll talk as sweetly to him as if he

were my own child!  You may trust me--indeed you may."



The door-bell rang.



"That is the gentleman now," said Laura.  Senator Dilworthy retired to

his study.



Laura welcomed Mr. Trollop, a grave, carefully dressed and very

respectable looking man, with a bald head, standing collar and old

fashioned watch seals.



"Promptness is a virtue, Mr. Trollop, and I perceive that you have it.

You are always prompt with me."



"I always meet my engagements, of every kind, Miss Hawkins."



"It is a quality which is rarer in the world than it has been, I believe.

I wished to see you on business, Mr. Trollop."



"I judged so.  What can I do for you?"



"You know my bill--the Knobs University bill?"



"Ah, I believe it is your bill.  I had forgotten.  Yes, I know the bill."



"Well, would you mind telling me your opinion of it?"



"Indeed, since you seem to ask it without reserve, I am obliged to say

that I do not regard it favorably.  I have not seen the bill itself, but

from what I can hear, it--it--well, it has a bad look about it.  It--"



"Speak it out--never fear."



"Well, it--they say it contemplates a fraud upon the government."



"Well?" said Laura tranquilly.



"Well!  I say 'Well?' too."



"Well, suppose it were a fraud--which I feel able to deny--would it be

the first one?"



"You take a body's breath away!  Would you--did you wish me to vote for

it?  Was that what you wanted to see me about?"



"Your instinct is correct.  I did want you--I do want you to vote for

it."



"Vote for a fr--for a measure which is generally believed to be at least

questionable?  I am afraid we cannot come to an understanding, Miss

Hawkins."



"No, I am afraid not--if you have resumed your principles, Mr. Trollop."



"Did you send for we merely to insult me?  It is time for me to take my

leave, Miss Hawkins."



"No-wait a moment.  Don't be offended at a trifle.  Do not be offish and

unsociable.  The Steamship Subsidy bill was a fraud on the government.

You voted for it, Mr. Trollop, though you always opposed the measure

until after you had an interview one evening with a certain Mrs. McCarter

at her house.  She was my agent.  She was acting for me.  Ah, that is

right--sit down again.  You can be sociable, easily enough if you have a

mind to.  Well?  I am waiting.  Have you nothing to say?"



"Miss Hawkins, I voted for that bill because when I came to examine into

it--"



"Ah yes.  When you came to examine into it.  Well, I only want you to

examine into my bill.  Mr. Trollop, you would not sell your vote on that

subsidy bill--which was perfectly right--but you accepted of some of the

stock, with the understanding that it was to stand in your brother-in-

law's name."



"There is no pr--I mean, this is, utterly groundless, Miss Hawkins."  But

the gentleman seemed somewhat uneasy, nevertheless.



"Well, not entirely so, perhaps.  I and a person whom we will call Miss

Blank (never mind the real name,) were in a closet at your elbow all the

while."



Mr. Trollop winced--then he said with dignity:



"Miss Hawkins is it possible that you were capable of such a thing as

that?"



"It was bad; I confess that.  It was bad.  Almost as bad as selling one's

vote for--but I forget; you did not sell your vote--you only accepted a

little trifle, a small token of esteem, for your brother-in-law.  Oh, let

us come out and be frank with each other: I know you, Mr. Trollop.

I have met you on business three or four times; true, I never offered to

corrupt your principles--never hinted such a thing; but always when I had

finished sounding you, I manipulated you through an agent.  Let us be

frank.  Wear this comely disguise of virtue before the public--it will

count there; but here it is out of place.  My dear sir, by and by there

is going to be an investigation into that National Internal Improvement

Directors' Relief Measure of a few years ago, and you know very well that

you will be a crippled man, as likely as not, when it is completed."



"It cannot be shown that a man is a knave merely for owning that stock.

I am not distressed about the National Improvement Relief Measure."



"Oh indeed I am not trying to distress you.  I only wished, to make good

my assertion that I knew you.  Several of you gentlemen bought of that

stack (without paying a penny down) received dividends from it, (think of

the happy idea of receiving dividends, and very large ones, too, from

stock one hasn't paid for!) and all the while your names never appeared

in the transaction; if ever you took the stock at all, you took it in

other people's names.  Now you see, you had to know one of two things;

namely, you either knew that the idea of all this preposterous generosity

was to bribe you into future legislative friendship, or you didn't know

it.  That is to say, you had to be either a knave or a--well, a fool--

there was no middle ground.  You are not a fool, Mr. Trollop."



"Miss Hawking you flatter me.  But seriously, you do not forget that some

of the best and purest men in Congress took that stock in that way?"



"Did Senator Bland?"



"Well, no--I believe not."



"Of course you believe not.  Do you suppose he was ever approached, on

the subject?"



"Perhaps not."



"If you had approached him, for instance, fortified with the fact that

some of the best men in Congress, and the purest, etc., etc.; what would

have been the result?"



"Well, what WOULD have been the result?"



"He would have shown you the door!  For Mr. Blank is neither a knave nor

a fool.  There are other men in the Senate and the House whom no one

would have been hardy enough to approach with that Relief Stock in that

peculiarly generous way, but they are not of the class that you regard as

the best and purest.  No, I say I know you Mr. Trollop.  That is to say,

one may suggest a thing to Mr. Trollop which it would not do to suggest

to Mr. Blank.  Mr. Trollop, you are pledged to support the Indigent

Congressmen's Retroactive Appropriation which is to come up, either in

this or the next session.  You do not deny that, even in public.  The man

that will vote for that bill will break the eighth commandment in any

other way, sir!"



"But he will not vote for your corrupt measure, nevertheless, madam!"

exclaimed Mr. Trollop, rising from his seat in a passion.



"Ah, but he will.  Sit down again, and let me explain why.  Oh, come,

don't behave so.  It is very unpleasant.  Now be good, and you shall

have, the missing page of your great speech.  Here it is!"--and she

displayed a sheet of manuscript.



Mr. Trollop turned immediately back from the threshold.  It might have

been gladness that flashed into his face; it might have been something

else; but at any rate there was much astonishment mixed with it.



"Good!  Where did you get it?  Give it me!"



"Now there is no hurry.  Sit down; sit down and let us talk and be

friendly."



The gentleman wavered.  Then he said:



"No, this is only a subterfuge.  I will go.  It is not the missing page."



Laura tore off a couple of lines from the bottom of the sheet.



"Now," she said, "you will know whether this is the handwriting or not.

You know it is the handwriting.  Now if you will listen, you will know

that this must be the list of statistics which was to be the 'nub' of

your great effort, and the accompanying blast the beginning of the burst

of eloquence which was continued on the next page--and you will recognize

that there was where you broke down."



She read the page.  Mr. Trollop said:



"This is perfectly astounding.  Still, what is all this to me?  It is

nothing.  It does not concern me.  The speech is made, and there an end.

I did break down for a moment, and in a rather uncomfortable place, since

I had led up to those statistics with some grandeur; the hiatus was

pleasanter to the House and the galleries than it was to me.  But it is

no matter now.  A week has passed; the jests about it ceased three or

four days ago.  The, whole thing is a matter of indifference to me, Miss

Hawkins."



"But you apologized; and promised the statistics for next day.  Why

didn't you keep your promise."



"The matter was not of sufficient consequence.  The time was gone by to

produce an effect with them."



"But I hear that other friends of the Soldiers' Pension Bill desire them

very much.  I think you ought to let them have them."



"Miss Hawkins, this silly blunder of my copyist evidently has more

interest for you than it has for me.  I will send my private secretary to

you and let him discuss the subject with you at length."



"Did he copy your speech for you?"



"Of course he did.  Why all these questions?  Tell me--how did you get

hold of that page of manuscript?  That is the only thing that stirs a

passing interest in my mind."



"I'm coming to that."  Then she said, much as if she were talking to

herself: "It does seem like taking a deal of unnecessary pains, for a

body to hire another body to construct a great speech for him and then go

and get still another body to copy it before it can be read in the

House."



"Miss Hawkins, what do yo mean by such talk as that?"



"Why I am sure I mean no harm--no harm to anybody in the world.  I am

certain that I overheard the Hon. Mr. Buckstone either promise to write

your great speech for you or else get some other competent person to do

it."



"This is perfectly absurd, madam, perfectly absurd!" and Mr. Trollop

affected a laugh of derision.



"Why, the thing has occurred before now.  I mean that I have heard that

Congressmen have sometimes hired literary grubs to build speeches for

them.--Now didn't I overhear a conversation like that I spoke of?"



"Pshaw!  Why of course you may have overheard some such jesting nonsense.

But would one be in earnest about so farcical a thing?"



"Well if it was only a joke, why did you make a serious matter of it?

Why did you get the speech written for you, and then read it in the House

without ever having it copied?"



Mr. Trollop did not laugh this time; he seemed seriously perplexed.  He

said:



"Come, play out your jest, Miss Hawkins.  I can't understand what you are

contriving--but it seems to entertain you--so please, go on."



"I will, I assure you; but I hope to make the matter entertaining to you,

too.  Your private secretary never copied your speech."



"Indeed?  Really you seem to know my affairs better than I do myself."



"I believe I do.  You can't name your own amanuensis, Mr. Trollop."



"That is sad, indeed.  Perhaps Miss Hawkins can?"



"Yes, I can.  I wrote your speech myself, and you read it from my

manuscript.  There, now!"



Mr. Trollop did not spring to his feet and smite his brow with his hand

while a cold sweat broke out all over him and the color forsook his face

--no, he only said, "Good God!" and looked greatly astonished.



Laura handed him her commonplace-book and called his attention to the

fact that the handwriting there and the handwriting of this speech were

the same.  He was shortly convinced.  He laid the book aside and said,

composedly:



"Well, the wonderful tragedy is done, and it transpires that I am

indebted to you for my late eloquence.  What of it?  What was all this

for and what does it amount to after all?  What do you propose to do

about it?"



"Oh nothing.  It is only a bit of pleasantry.  When I overheard that

conversation I took an early opportunity to ask Mr. Buckstone if he knew

of anybody who might want a speech written--I had a friend, and so forth

and so on.  I was the friend, myself; I thought I might do you a good

turn then and depend on you to do me one by and by.  I never let Mr.

Buckstone have the speech till the last moment, and when you hurried off

to the House with it, you did not know there was a missing page, of

course, but I did.



"And now perhaps you think that if I refuse to support your bill, you

will make a grand exposure?"



"Well I had not thought of that.  I only kept back the page for the mere

fun of the thing; but since you mention it, I don't know but I might do

something if I were angry."



"My dear Miss Hawkins, if you were to give out that you composed my

speech, you know very well that people would say it was only your

raillery, your fondness for putting a victim in the pillory and amusing

the public at his expense.  It is too flimsy, Miss Hawkins, for a person

of your fine inventive talent--contrive an abler device than that.

Come!"



"It is easily done, Mr. Trollop.  I will hire a man, and pin this page on

his breast, and label it, 'The Missing Fragment of the Hon. Mr. Trollop's

Great Speech--which speech was written and composed by Miss Laura Hawkins

under a secret understanding for one hundred dollars--and the money has

not been paid.'  And I will pin round about it notes in my handwriting,

which I will procure from prominent friends of mine for the occasion;

also your printed speech in the Globe, showing the connection between its

bracketed hiatus and my Fragment; and I give you my word of honor that I

will stand that human bulletin board in the rotunda of the capitol and

make him stay there a week!  You see you are premature, Mr. Trollop, the

wonderful tragedy is not done yet, by any means.  Come, now, doesn't it

improve?"



Mr Trollop opened his eyes rather widely at this novel aspect of the

case.  He got up and walked the floor and gave himself a moment for

reflection.  Then he stopped and studied Laura's face a while, and ended

by saying:



"Well, I am obliged to believe yon would be reckless enough to do that."



"Then don't put me to the test, Mr. Trollop.  But let's drop the matter.

I have had my joke and you've borne the infliction becomingly enough.

It spoils a jest to harp on it after one has had one's laugh.  I would

much rather talk about my bill."



"So would I, now, my clandestine amanuensis.  Compared with some other

subjects, even your bill is a pleasant topic to discuss."



"Very good indeed!  I thought.  I could persuade you.  Now I am sure you

will be generous to the poor negro and vote for that bill."



"Yes, I feel more tenderly toward the oppressed colored man than I did.

Shall we bury the hatchet and be good friends and respect each other's

little secrets, on condition that I vote Aye on the measure?"



"With all my heart, Mr. Trollop.  I give you my word of that."



"It is a bargain.  But isn't there something else you could give me,

too?"



Laura looked at him inquiringly a moment, and then she comprehended.



"Oh, yes!  You may have it now.  I haven't any, more use for it."  She

picked up the page of manuscript, but she reconsidered her intention of

handing it to him, and said, "But never mind; I will keep it close; no

one shall see it; you shall have it as soon as your vote is recorded."



Mr. Trollop looked disappointed.  But presently made his adieux, and had

got as far as the hall, when something occurred to Laura.  She said to

herself, "I don't simply want his vote under compulsion--he might vote

aye, but work against the bill in secret, for revenge; that man is

unscrupulous enough to do anything.  I must have his hearty co-operation

as well as his vote.  There is only one way to get that."



She called him back, and said:



"I value your vote, Mr. Trollop, but I value your influence more.  You

are able to help a measure along in many ways, if you choose.  I want to

ask you to work for the bill as well as vote for it."



"It takes so much of one's time, Miss Hawkins--and time is money, you

know."



"Yes, I know it is--especially in Congress.  Now there is no use in you

and I dealing in pretenses and going at matters in round-about ways.

We know each other--disguises are nonsense.  Let us be plain.  I will

make it an object to you to work for the bill."



"Don't make it unnecessarily plain, please.  There are little proprieties

that are best preserved.  What do you propose?"



"Well, this."  She mentioned the names of several prominent Congressmen.



"Now," said she, "these gentlemen are to vote and work for the bill,

simply out of love for the negro--and out of pure generosity I have put

in a relative of each as a member of the University incorporation.  They

will handle a million or so of money, officially, but will receive no

salaries.  A larger number of statesmen are to, vote and work for the

bill--also out of love for the negro--gentlemen of but moderate

influence, these--and out of pure generosity I am to see that relatives

of theirs have positions in the University, with salaries, and good ones,

too.  You will vote and work for the bill, from mere affection for the

negro, and I desire to testify my gratitude becomingly.  Make free

choice.  Have you any friend whom you would like to present with a

salaried or unsalaried position in our institution?"



"Well, I have a brother-in-law--"



"That same old brother-in-law, you good unselfish provider!  I have heard

of him often, through my agents.  How regularly he does 'turn up,' to be

sure.  He could deal with those millions virtuously, and withal with

ability, too--but of course you would rather he had a salaried position?"



"Oh, no," said the gentleman, facetiously, "we are very humble, very

humble in our desires; we want no money; we labor solely, for our country

and require no reward but the luxury of an applauding conscience.  Make

him one of those poor hard working unsalaried corporators and let him do

every body good with those millions--and go hungry himself!  I will try

to exert a little influence in favor of the bill."



Arrived at home, Mr. Trollop sat down and thought it all over--something

after this fashion: it is about the shape it might have taken if he had

spoken it aloud.



"My reputation is getting a little damaged, and I meant to clear it up

brilliantly with an exposure of this bill at the supreme moment, and ride

back into Congress on the eclat of it; and if I had that bit of

manuscript, I would do it yet.  It would be more money in my pocket in

the end, than my brother-in-law will get out of that incorporatorship,

fat as it is.  But that sheet of paper is out of my reach--she will never

let that get out of her hands.  And what a mountain it is!  It blocks up

my road, completely.  She was going to hand it to me, once.  Why didn't

she!  Must be a deep woman.  Deep devil!  That is what she is;

a beautiful devil--and perfectly fearless, too.  The idea of her pinning

that paper on a man and standing him up in the rotunda looks absurd at a

first glance.  But she would do it!  She is capable of doing anything.

I went there hoping she would try to bribe me--good solid capital that

would be in the exposure.  Well, my prayer was answered; she did try to

bribe me; and I made the best of a bad bargain and let her.  I am check-

mated.  I must contrive something fresh to get back to Congress on.

Very well; a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; I will work for

the bill--the incorporatorship will be a very good thing."



As soon as Mr. Trollop had taken his leave, Laura ran to Senator

Dilworthy and began to speak, but he interrupted her and said

distressfully, without even turning from his writing to look at her:



"Only half an hour!  You gave it up early, child.  However, it was best,

it was best--I'm sure it was best--and safest."



"Give it up!  I!"



The Senator sprang up, all aglow:



"My child, you can't mean that you--"



"I've made him promise on honor to think about a compromise tonight and

come and tell me his decision in the morning."



"Good!  There's hope yet that--"



Nonsense, uncle.  I've made him engage to let the Tennessee Land bill

utterly alone!"



"Impossible!  You--"



"I've made him promise to vote with us!"



"INCREDIBLE!  Abso--"



"I've made him swear that he'll work for us!"



"PRE - - - POSTEROUS!--Utterly pre--break a window, child, before I

suffocate!"



"No matter, it's true anyway.  Now we can march into Congress with drums

beating and colors flying!"



"Well--well--well.  I'm sadly bewildered, sadly bewildered.  I can't

understand it at all--the most extraordinary woman that ever--it's a

great day, it's a great day.  There--there--let me put my hand in

benediction on this precious head.  Ah, my child, the poor negro will

bless--"



"Oh bother the poor negro, uncle!  Put it in your speech.  Good-night,

good-bye--we'll marshal our forces and march with the dawn!"



Laura reflected a while, when she was alone, and then fell to laughing,

peacefully.



"Everybody works for me,"--so ran her thought.  "It was a good idea to

make Buckstone lead Mr. Trollop on to get a great speech written for him;

and it was a happy part of the same idea for me to copy the speech after

Mr. Buckstone had written it, and then keep back a page.  Mr. B.  was

very complimentary to me when Trollop's break-down in the House showed

him the object of my mysterious scheme; I think he will say, still finer

things when I tell him the triumph the sequel to it has gained for us.



"But what a coward the man was, to believe I would have exposed that page

in the rotunda, and so exposed myself.  However, I don't know--I don't

know.  I will think a moment.  Suppose he voted no; suppose the bill

failed; that is to suppose this stupendous game lost forever, that I have

played so desperately for; suppose people came around pitying me--odious!

And he could have saved me by his single voice.  Yes, I would have

exposed him!  What would I care for the talk that that would have made

about me when I was gone to Europe with Selby and all the world was busy

with my history and my dishonor?  It would be almost happiness to spite

somebody at such a time."









CHAPTER XLIII.



The very next day, sure enough, the campaign opened.  In due course, the

Speaker of the House reached that Order of Business which is termed

"Notices of Bills," and then the Hon. Mr. Buckstone rose in his place and

gave notice of a bill "To Found and Incorporate the Knobs Industrial

University," and then sat down without saying anything further.  The busy

gentlemen in the reporters' gallery jotted a line in their note-books,

ran to the telegraphic desk in a room which communicated with their own

writing-parlor, and then hurried back to their places in the gallery; and

by the time they had resumed their seats, the line which they had

delivered to the operator had been read in telegraphic offices in towns

and cities hundreds of miles away.  It was distinguished by frankness of

language as well as by brevity:



"The child is born.  Buckstone gives notice of the thieving Knobs

University job.  It is said the noses have been counted and enough votes

have been bought to pass it."



For some time the correspondents had been posting their several journals

upon the alleged disreputable nature of the bill, and furnishing daily

reports of the Washington gossip concerning it.  So the next morning,

nearly every newspaper of character in the land assailed the measure and

hurled broadsides of invective at Mr. Buckstone.  The Washington papers

were more respectful, as usual--and conciliatory, also, as usual.  They

generally supported measures, when it was possible; but when they could

not they "deprecated" violent expressions of opinion in other

journalistic quarters.



They always deprecated, when there was trouble ahead.  However, 'The

Washington Daily Love-Feast' hailed the bill with warm approbation.  This

was Senator Balaam's paper--or rather, "Brother" Balaam, as he was

popularly called, for he had been a clergyman, in his day; and he himself

and all that he did still emitted an odor of sanctity now that he had

diverged into journalism and politics.  He was a power in the

Congressional prayer meeting, and in all movements that looked to the

spread of religion and temperance.



His paper supported the new bill with gushing affection; it was a noble

measure; it was a just measure; it was a generous measure; it was a pure

measure, and that surely should recommend it in these corrupt times; and

finally, if the nature of the bill were not known at all, the 'Love

Feast' would support it anyway, and unhesitatingly, for the fact that

Senator Dilworthy was the originator of the measure was a guaranty that

it contemplated a worthy and righteous work.



Senator Dilworthy was so anxious to know what the New York papers would

say about the bill; that he had arranged to have synopses of their

editorials telegraphed to him; he could not wait for the papers

themselves to crawl along down to Washington by a mail train which has

never run over a cow since the road was built; for the reason that it has

never been able to overtake one.  It carries the usual "cow-catcher" in

front of the locomotive, but this is mere ostentation.  It ought to be

attached to the rear car, where it could do some good; but instead, no

provision is made there for the protection of the traveling public, and

hence it is not a matter of surprise that cows so frequently climb aboard

that train and among the passengers.



The Senator read his dispatches aloud at the breakfast table.  Laura was

troubled beyond measure at their tone, and said that that sort of comment

would defeat the bill; but the Senator said:



"Oh, not at all, not at all, my child.  It is just what we want.

Persecution is the one thing needful, now--all the other forces are

secured.  Give us newspaper persecution enough, and we are safe.

Vigorous persecution will alone carry a bill sometimes, dear; and when

you start with a strong vote in the first place, persecution comes in

with double effect.  It scares off some of the weak supporters, true,

but it soon turns strong ones into stubborn ones.  And then, presently,

it changes the tide of public opinion.  The great public is weak-minded;

the great public is sentimental; the great public always turns around and

weeps for an odious murderer, and prays for-him, and carries flowers to

his prison and besieges the governor with appeals to his clemency, as

soon as the papers begin to howl for that man's blood.--In a word, the

great putty-hearted public loves to 'gush,' and there is no such darling

opportunity to gush as a case of persecution affords."



"Well, uncle, dear; if your theory is right, let us go into raptures,

for nobody can ask a heartier persecution than these editorials are

furnishing."



"I am not so sure of that, my daughter.  I don't entirely like the tone

of some of these remarks.  They lack vim, they lack venom.  Here is one

calls it a 'questionable measure.'  Bah, there is no strength in that.

This one is better; it calls it 'highway robbery.'  That sounds something

like.  But now this one seems satisfied to call it an 'iniquitous

scheme'.  'Iniquitous' does not exasperate anybody; it is weak--puerile.

The ignorant will imagine it to be intended for a compliment.  But this

other one--the one I read last--has the true ring: 'This vile, dirty

effort to rob the public treasury, by the kites and vultures that now

infest the filthy den called Congress'--that is admirable, admirable!

We must have more of that sort.  But it will come--no fear of that;

they're not warmed up, yet.  A week from now you'll see."



"Uncle, you and Brother Balaam are bosom friends--why don't you get his

paper to persecute us, too?"



"It isn't worth while, my, daughter.  His support doesn't hurt a bill.

Nobody reads his editorials but himself.  But I wish the New York papers

would talk a little plainer.  It is annoying to have to wait a week for

them to warm up.  I expected better things at their hands--and time is

precious, now."



At the proper hour, according to his previous notice, Mr. Buckstone duly

introduced his bill entitled "An Act to Found and Incorporate the Knobs

Industrial University," moved its proper reference, and sat down.



The Speaker of the House rattled off this observation:



"'Fnobjectionbilltakuzhlcoixrssoreferred!'"



Habitues of the House comprehended that this long, lightning-heeled word

signified that if there was no objection, the bill would take the

customary course of a measure of its nature, and be referred to the

Committee on Benevolent Appropriations, and that it was accordingly so

referred.  Strangers merely supposed that the Speaker was taking a gargle

for some affection of the throat.



The reporters immediately telegraphed the introduction of the bill.--And

they added:



     "The assertion that the bill will pass was premature.  It is said

     that many favorers of it will desert when the storm breaks upon them

     from the public press."



The storm came, and during ten days it waxed more and more violent day by

day.  The great "Negro University Swindle" became the one absorbing topic

of conversation throughout the Union.  Individuals denounced it, journals

denounced it, public meetings denounced it, the pictorial papers

caricatured its friends, the whole nation seemed to be growing frantic

over it.  Meantime the Washington correspondents were sending such

telegrams as these abroad in the land; Under date of--



SATURDAY.  "Congressmen Jex and Fluke are wavering; it is believed they

will desert the execrable bill."



MONDAY.  "Jex and Fluke have deserted!"



THURSDAY.  "Tubbs and Huffy left the sinking ship last night"



Later on:



"Three desertions.  The University thieves are getting scared, though

they will not own it."



Later:



"The leaders are growing stubborn--they swear they can carry it, but it

is now almost certain that they no longer have a majority!"



After a day or two of reluctant and ambiguous telegrams:



"Public sentiment seems changing, a trifle in favor of the bill--

but only a trifle."



And still later:



"It is whispered that the Hon. Mr. Trollop has gone over to the pirates.

It is probably a canard.  Mr. Trollop has all along been the bravest and

most efficient champion of virtue and the people against the bill, and

the report is without doubt a shameless invention."



Next day:



"With characteristic treachery, the truckling and pusillanimous reptile,

Crippled-Speech Trollop, has gone over to the enemy.  It is contended,

now, that he has been a friend to the bill, in secret, since the day it

was introduced, and has had bankable reasons for being so; but he himself

declares that he has gone over because the malignant persecution of the

bill by the newspapers caused him to study its provisions with more care

than he had previously done, and this close examination revealed the fact

that the measure is one in every way worthy of support.  (Pretty thin!)

It cannot be denied that this desertion has had a damaging effect.  Jex

and Fluke have returned to their iniquitous allegiance, with six or eight

others of lesser calibre, and it is reported and believed that Tubbs and

Huffy are ready to go back.  It is feared that the University swindle is

stronger to-day than it has ever been before."



Later-midnight:



"It is said that the committee will report the bill back to-morrow.  Both

sides are marshaling their forces, and the fight on this bill is

evidently going to be the hottest of the session.--All Washington is

boiling."









CHAPTER XLIV.



"It's easy enough for another fellow to talk," said Harry, despondingly,

after he had put Philip in possession of his view of the case.  "It's

easy enough to say 'give her up,' if you don't care for her.  What am I

going to do to give her up?"



It seemed to Harry that it was a situation requiring some active

measures.  He couldn't realize that he had fallen hopelessly in love

without some rights accruing to him for the possession of the object of

his passion.  Quiet resignation under relinquishment of any thing he

wanted was not in his line.  And when it appeared to him that his

surrender of Laura would be the withdrawal of the one barrier that kept

her from ruin, it was unreasonable to expect that he could see how to

give her up.



Harry had the most buoyant confidence in his own projects always; he saw

everything connected with himself in a large way and in rosy lines.  This

predominance of the imagination over the judgment gave that appearance of

exaggeration to his conversation and to his communications with regard to

himself, which sometimes conveyed the impression that he was not speaking

the truth.  His acquaintances had been known to say that they invariably

allowed a half for shrinkage in his statements, and held the other half

under advisement for confirmation.



Philip in this case could not tell from Harry's story exactly how much

encouragement Laura had given him, nor what hopes he might justly have of

winning her.  He had never seen him desponding before.  The "brag"

appeared to be all taken out of him, and his airy manner only asserted

itself now and then in a comical imitation of its old self.



Philip wanted time to look about him before he decided what to do.

He was not familiar with Washington, and it was difficult to adjust his

feelings and perceptions to its peculiarities.  Coming out of the sweet

sanity of the Bolton household, this was by contrast the maddest Vanity

Fair one could conceive.  It seemed to him a feverish, unhealthy

atmosphere in which lunacy would be easily developed.  He fancied that

everybody attached to himself an exaggerated importance, from the fact of

being at the national capital, the center of political influence, the

fountain of patronage, preferment, jobs and opportunities.



People were introduced to each other as from this or that state, not from

cities or towns, and this gave a largeness to their representative

feeling.  All the women talked politics as naturally and glibly as they

talk fashion or literature elsewhere.  There was always some exciting

topic at the Capitol, or some huge slander was rising up like a miasmatic

exhalation from the Potomac, threatening to settle no one knew exactly

where.  Every other person was an aspirant for a place, or, if he had

one, for a better place, or more pay; almost every other one had some

claim or interest or remedy to urge; even the women were all advocates

for the advancement of some person, and they violently espoused or

denounced this or that measure as it would affect some relative,

acquaintance or friend.



Love, travel, even death itself, waited on the chances of the dies daily

thrown in the two Houses, and the committee rooms there.  If the measure

went through, love could afford to ripen into marriage, and longing for

foreign travel would have fruition; and it must have been only eternal

hope springing in the breast that kept alive numerous old claimants who

for years and years had besieged the doors of Congress, and who looked as

if they needed not so much an appropriation of money as six feet of

ground.  And those who stood so long waiting for success to bring them

death were usually those who had a just claim.



Representing states and talking of national and even international

affairs, as familiarly as neighbors at home talk of poor crops and the

extravagance of their ministers, was likely at first to impose upon

Philip as to the importance of the people gathered here.



There was a little newspaper editor from Phil's native town, the

assistant on a Peddletonian weekly, who made his little annual joke about

the "first egg laid on our table," and who was the menial of every

tradesman in the village and under bonds to him for frequent "puffs,"

except the undertaker, about whose employment he was recklessly

facetious.  In Washington he was an important man, correspondent, and

clerk of two house committees, a "worker" in politics, and a confident

critic of every woman and every man in Washington.  He would be a consul

no doubt by and by, at some foreign port, of the language of which he was

ignorant--though if ignorance of language were a qualification he might

have been a consul at home.  His easy familiarity with great men was

beautiful to see, and when Philip learned what a tremendous underground

influence this little ignoramus had, he no longer wondered at the queer

appointments and the queerer legislation.



Philip was not long in discovering that people in Washington did not

differ much from other people; they had the same meannesses,

generosities, and tastes: A Washington boarding house had the odor of a

boarding house the world over.



Col. Sellers was as unchanged as any one Philip saw whom he had known

elsewhere.  Washington appeared to be the native element of this man.

His pretentions were equal to any he encountered there.  He saw nothing

in its society that equalled that of Hawkeye, he sat down to no table

that could not be unfavorably contrasted with his own at home; the most

airy scheme inflated in the hot air of the capital only reached in

magnitude some of his lesser fancies, the by-play of his constructive

imagination.



"The country is getting along very well," he said to Philip, "but our

public men are too timid.  What we want is more money.  I've told

Boutwell so.  Talk about basing the currency on gold; you might as well

base it on pork.  Gold is only one product.  Base it on everything!

You've got to do something for the West.  How am I to move my crops?

We must have improvements.  Grant's got the idea.  We want a canal from

the James River to the Mississippi.  Government ought to build it."



It was difficult to get the Colonel off from these large themes when he

was once started, but Philip brought the conversation round to Laura and

her reputation in the City.



"No," he said, "I haven't noticed much.  We've been so busy about this

University.  It will make Laura rich with the rest of us, and she has

done nearly as much as if she were a man.  She has great talent, and will

make a big match.  I see the foreign ministers and that sort after her.

Yes, there is talk, always will be about a pretty woman so much in public

as she is.  Tough stories come to me, but I put'em away.  'Taint likely

one of Si Hawkins's children would do that--for she is the same as a

child of his.  I told her, though, to go slow," added the Colonel, as if

that mysterious admonition from him would set everything right.



"Do you know anything about a Col. Selby?"



"Know all about him.  Fine fellow.  But he's got a wife; and I told him,

as a friend, he'd better sheer off from Laura.  I reckon he thought

better of it and did."



But Philip was not long in learning the truth.  Courted as Laura was by a

certain class and still admitted into society, that, nevertheless, buzzed

with disreputable stories about her, she had lost character with the best

people.  Her intimacy with Selby was open gossip, and there were winks

and thrustings of the tongue in any group of men when she passed by.

It was clear enough that Harry's delusion must be broken up, and that no

such feeble obstacle as his passion could interpose would turn Laura from

her fate.  Philip determined to see her, and put himself in possession of

the truth, as he suspected it, in order to show Harry his folly.



Laura, after her last conversation with Harry, had a new sense of her

position.  She had noticed before the signs of a change in manner towards

her, a little less respect perhaps from men, and an avoidance by women.

She had attributed this latter partly to jealousy of her, for no one is

willing to acknowledge a fault in himself when a more agreeable motive

can be found for the estrangement of his acquaintances.  But now, if

society had turned on her, she would defy it.  It was not in her nature

to shrink.  She knew she had been wronged, and she knew that she had no

remedy.



What she heard of Col. Selby's proposed departure alarmed her more than

anything else, and she calmly determined that if he was deceiving her the

second time it should be the last.  Let society finish the tragedy if it

liked; she was indifferent what came after.  At the first opportunity,

she charged Selby with his intention to abandon her.  He unblushingly

denied it.



He had not thought of going to Europe.  He had only been amusing himself

with Sellers' schemes.  He swore that as soon as she succeeded with her

bill, he would fly with her to any part of the world.



She did not quite believe him, for she saw that he feared her, and she

began to suspect that his were the protestations of a coward to gain

time.  But she showed him no doubts.



She only watched his movements day by day, and always held herself ready

to act promptly.



When Philip came into the presence of this attractive woman, he could not

realize that she was the subject of all the scandal he had heard.  She

received him with quite the old Hawkeye openness and cordiality, and fell

to talking at once of their little acquaintance there; and it seemed

impossible that he could ever say to her what he had come determined to

say.  Such a man as Philip has only one standard by which to judge women.



Laura recognized that fact no doubt.  The better part of her woman's

nature saw it.  Such a man might, years ago, not now, have changed her

nature, and made the issue of her life so different, even after her cruel

abandonment.  She had a dim feeling of this, and she would like now to

stand well with him.  The spark of truth and honor that was left in her

was elicited by his presence.  It was this influence that governed her

conduct in this interview.



"I have come," said Philip in his direct manner, "from my friend

Mr. Brierly.  You are not ignorant of his feeling towards you?"



"Perhaps not."



"But perhaps you do not know, you who have so much admiration, how

sincere and overmastering his love is for you?"  Philip would not have

spoken so plainly, if he had in mind anything except to draw from Laura

something that would end Harry's passion.



"And is sincere love so rare, Mr. Sterling?" asked Laura, moving her foot

a little, and speaking with a shade of sarcasm.



"Perhaps not in Washington," replied Philip,--tempted into a similar

tone.  "Excuse my bluntness," he continued, "but would the knowledge of

his love; would his devotion, make any difference to you in your

Washington life?"



"In respect to what?" asked Laura quickly.



"Well, to others.  I won't equivocate--to Col. Selby?"



Laura's face flushed with anger, or shame; she looked steadily at Philip

and began,



"By what right, sir,--"



"By the right of friendship," interrupted Philip stoutly.  "It may matter

little to you.  It is everything to him.  He has a Quixotic notion that

you would turn back from what is before you for his sake.  You cannot be

ignorant of what all the city is talking of."  Philip said this

determinedly and with some bitterness.



It was a full minute before Laura spoke.  Both had risen, Philip as if to

go, and Laura in suppressed excitement.  When she spoke her voice was

very unsteady, and she looked down.



"Yes, I know.  I perfectly understand what you mean.  Mr. Brierly is

nothing--simply nothing.  He is a moth singed, that is all--the trifler

with women thought he was a wasp.  I have no pity for him, not the least.

You may tell him not to make a fool of himself, and to keep away.  I say

this on your account, not his.  You are not like him.  It is enough for

me that you want it so.  Mr. Sterling," she continued, looking up; and

there were tears in her eyes that contradicted the hardness of her

language, "you might not pity him if you knew my history; perhaps you

would not wonder at some things you hear.  No; it is useless to ask me

why it must be so.  You can't make a life over--society wouldn't let you

if you would--and mine must be lived as it is.  There, sir, I'm not

offended; but it is useless for you to say anything more."



Philip went away with his heart lightened about Harry, but profoundly

saddened by the glimpse of what this woman might have been.  He told

Harry all that was necessary of the conversation--she was bent on going

her own way, he had not the ghost of a chance--he was a fool, she had

said, for thinking he had.



And Harry accepted it meekly, and made up his own mind that Philip didn't

know much about women.









CHAPTER XLV.



The galleries of the House were packed, on the momentous day, not because

the reporting of an important bill back by a committee was a thing to be

excited about, if the bill were going to take the ordinary course

afterward; it would be like getting excited over the empaneling of a

coroner's jury in a murder case, instead of saving up one's emotions for

the grander occasion of the hanging of the accused, two years later,

after all the tedious forms of law had been gone through with.



But suppose you understand that this coroner's jury is going to turn out

to be a vigilance committee in disguise, who will hear testimony for an

hour and then hang the murderer on the spot?  That puts a different

aspect upon the matter.  Now it was whispered that the legitimate forms

of procedure usual in the House, and which keep a bill hanging along for

days and even weeks, before it is finally passed upon, were going to be

overruled, in this case, and short work made of the, measure; and so,

what was beginning as a mere inquest might, torn out to be something very

different.



In the course of the day's business the Order of "Reports of Committees"

was finally reached and when the weary crowds heard that glad

announcement issue from the Speaker's lips they ceased to fret at the

dragging delay, and plucked up spirit.  The Chairman of the Committee on

Benevolent Appropriations rose and made his report, and just then a blue-

uniformed brass-mounted little page put a note into his hand.



It was from Senator Dilworthy, who had appeared upon the floor of the

House for a moment and flitted away again:



     "Everybody expects a grand assault in force; no doubt you believe,

     as I certainly do, that it is the thing to do; we are strong, and

     everything is hot for the contest.  Trollop's espousal of our cause

     has immensely helped us and we grow in power constantly.  Ten of the

     opposition were called away from town about noon,(but--so it is

     said--only for one day).  Six others are sick, but expect to be

     about again tomorrow or next day, a friend tells me.  A bold

     onslaught is worth trying.  Go for a suspension of the rules!  You

     will find we can swing a two-thirds vote--I am perfectly satisfied

     of it.  The Lord's truth will prevail.

                                                  "DILWORTHY.



Mr. Buckstone had reported the bills from his committee, one by one,

leaving the bill to the last.  When the House had voted upon the

acceptance or rejection of the report upon all but it, and the question

now being upon its disposal--Mr. Buckstone begged that the House would

give its attention to a few remarks which he desired to make.  His

committee had instructed him to report the bill favorably; he wished to

explain the nature of the measure, and thus justify the committee's

action; the hostility roused by the press would then disappear, and the

bill would shine forth in its true and noble character.  He said that its

provisions were simple.  It incorporated the Knobs Industrial University,

locating it in East Tennessee, declaring it open to all persons without

distinction of sex, color or religion, and committing its management to a

board of perpetual trustees, with power to fill vacancies in their own

number.  It provided for the erection of certain buildings for the

University, dormitories, lecture-halls, museums, libraries, laboratories,

work-shops, furnaces, and mills.  It provided also for the purchase of

sixty-five thousand acres of land, (fully described) for the purposes of

the University, in the Knobs of East Tennessee.  And it appropriated

[blank] dollars for the purchase of the Land, which should be the

property of the national trustees in trust for the uses named.



Every effort had been made to secure the refusal of the whole amount of

the property of the Hawkins heirs in the Knobs, some seventy-five

thousand acres Mr. Buckstone said.  But Mr. Washington Hawkins (one of

the heirs) objected.  He was, indeed, very reluctant to sell any part of

the land at any price; and indeed--this reluctance was justifiable when

one considers how constantly and how greatly the property is rising in

value.



What the South needed, continued Mr. Buckstone, was skilled labor.

Without that it would be unable to develop its mines, build its roads,

work to advantage and without great waste its fruitful land, establish

manufactures or enter upon a prosperous industrial career.  Its laborers

were almost altogether unskilled.  Change them into intelligent, trained

workmen, and you increased at once the capital, the resources of the

entire south, which would enter upon a prosperity hitherto unknown.

In five years the increase in local wealth would not only reimburse the

government for the outlay in this appropriation, but pour untold wealth

into the treasury.



This was the material view, and the least important in the honorable

gentleman's opinion.  [Here he referred to some notes furnished him by

Senator Dilworthy, and then continued.] God had given us the care of

these colored millions.  What account should we render to Him of our

stewardship?  We had made them free.  Should we leave them ignorant?

We had cast them upon their own resources.  Should we leave them without

tools?  We could not tell what the intentions of Providence are in regard

to these peculiar people, but our duty was plain.  The Knobs Industrial

University would be a vast school of modern science and practice, worthy

of a great nation.  It would combine the advantages of Zurich, Freiburg,

Creuzot and the Sheffield Scientific.  Providence had apparently reserved

and set apart the Knobs of East Tennessee for this purpose.  What else

were they for?  Was it not wonderful that for more than thirty years,

over a generation, the choicest portion of them had remained in one

family, untouched, as if, separated for some great use!



It might be asked why the government should buy this land, when it had

millions of yes, more than the railroad companies desired, which, it

might devote to this purpose?  He answered, that the government had no

such tract of land as this.  It had nothing comparable to it for the

purposes of the University: This was to be a school of mining, of

engineering, of the working of metals, of chemistry, zoology, botany,

manufactures, agriculture, in short of all the complicated industries

that make a state great.  There was no place for the location of such a

school like the Knobs of East Tennessee.  The hills abounded in metals of

all sorts, iron in all its combinations, copper, bismuth, gold and silver

in small quantities, platinum he--believed, tin, aluminium; it was

covered with forests and strange plants; in the woods were found the

coon, the opossum, the fox, the deer and many other animals who roamed in

the domain of natural history; coal existed in enormous quantity and no

doubt oil; it was such a place for the practice of agricultural

experiments that any student who had been successful there would have an

easy task in any other portion of the country.



No place offered equal facilities for experiments in mining, metallurgy,

engineering.  He expected to live to see the day, when the youth of the

south would resort to its mines, its workshops, its labratories, its

furnaces and factories for practical instruction in all the great

industrial pursuits.



A noisy and rather ill-natured debate followed, now, and lasted hour

after hour.  The friends of the bill were instructed by the leaders to

make no efort to check it; it was deemed better strategy to tire out the

opposition; it was decided to vote down every proposition to adjourn, and

so continue the sitting into the night; opponents might desert, then, one

by one and weaken their party, for they had no personal stake in the

bill.



Sunset came, and still the fight went on; the gas was lit, the crowd in

the galleries began to thin, but the contest continued; the crowd

returned, by and by, with hunger and thirst appeased, and aggravated the

hungry and thirsty House by looking contented and comfortable; but still

the wrangle lost nothing of its bitterness.  Recesses were moved

plaintively by the opposition, and invariably voted down by the

University army.



At midnight the House presented a spectacle calculated to interest a

stranger.  The great galleries were still thronged--though only with men,

now; the bright colors that had made them look like hanging gardens were

gone, with the ladies.  The reporters' gallery, was merely occupied by

one or two watchful sentinels of the quill-driving guild; the main body

cared nothing for a debate that had dwindled to a mere vaporing of dull

speakers and now and then a brief quarrel over a point of order; but

there was an unusually large attendance of journalists in the reporters'

waiting-room, chatting, smoking, and keeping on the 'qui vive' for the

general irruption of the Congressional volcano that must come when the

time was ripe for it.  Senator Dilworthy and Philip were in the

Diplomatic Gallery; Washington sat in the public gallery, and Col.

Sellers was, not far away.  The Colonel had been flying about the

corridors and button-holing Congressmen all the evening, and believed

that he had accomplished a world of valuable service; but fatigue was

telling upon him, now, and he was quiet and speechless--for once.  Below,

a few Senators lounged upon the sofas set apart for visitors, and talked

with idle Congressmen.  A dreary member was speaking; the presiding

officer was nodding; here and there little knots of members stood in the

aisles, whispering together; all about the House others sat in all the

various attitudes that express weariness; some, tilted back, had one or

more legs disposed upon their desks; some sharpened pencils indolently;

some scribbled aimlessly; some yawned and stretched; a great many lay

upon their breasts upon the desks, sound asleep and gently snoring.

The flooding gaslight from the fancifully wrought roof poured down upon

the tranquil scene.  Hardly a sound disturbed the stillness, save the

monotonous eloquence of the gentleman who occupied the floor.  Now and

then a warrior of the opposition broke down under the pressure, gave it

up, and went home.



Mr. Buckstone began to think it might be safe, now, to "proceed to

business."  He consulted with Trollop and one or two others.  Senator

Dilworthy descended to the floor of the House and they went to meet him.

After a brief comparison of notes, the Congressmen sought their seats and

sent pages about the House with messages to friends.  These latter

instantly roused up, yawned, and began to look alert.  The moment the

floor was unoccupied, Mr. Buckstone rose, with an injured look, and said

it was evident that the opponents of the bill were merely talking against

time, hoping in this unbecoming way to tire out the friends of the

measure and so defeat it.  Such conduct might be respectable enough in a

village debating society, but it was trivial among statesmen, it was out

of place in so august an assemblage as the House of Representatives of

the United States.  The friends of the bill had been not only willing

that its opponents should express their opinions, but had strongly

desired it.  They courted the fullest and freest discussion; but it

seemed to him that this fairness was but illy appreciated, since

gentlemen were capable of taking advantage of it for selfish and unworthy

ends.  This trifling had gone far enough.  He called for the question.



The instant Mr. Buckstone sat down, the storm burst forth.  A dozen

gentlemen sprang to their feet.



"Mr. Speaker!"



"Mr. Speaker!"



"Mr. Speaker!"



"Order!  Order!  Order!  Question!  Question!"



The sharp blows of the Speaker's gavel rose above the din.



The "previous question," that hated gag, was moved and carried.  All

debate came to a sudden end, of course.  Triumph No. 1.



Then the vote was taken on the adoption of the report and it carried by a

surprising majority.



Mr. Buckstone got the floor again and moved that the rules be suspended

and the bill read a first time.



Mr. Trollop--"Second the motion!"



The Speaker--"It is moved and--"



Clamor of Voices.  "Move we adjourn!  Second the motion!  Adjourn!

Adjourn!  Order!  Order!"



The Speaker, (after using his gavel vigorously)--"It is moved and

seconded that the House do now adjourn.  All those in favor--"



Voices--"Division!  Division!  Ayes and nays!  Ayes and nays!"



It was decided to vote upon the adjournment by ayes and nays.  This was

in earnest.  The excitement was furious.  The galleries were in commotion

in an instant, the reporters swarmed to their places. Idling members of

the House flocked to their seats, nervous gentlemen sprang to their feet,

pages flew hither and thither, life and animation were visible

everywhere, all the long ranks of faces in the building were kindled.



"This thing decides it!" thought Mr. Buckstone; "but let the fight

proceed."



The voting began, and every sound.  ceased but the calling if the names

and the "Aye!"  "No!"  "No!"  "Aye!" of the responses.  There was not a

movement in the House; the people seemed to hold their breath.



The voting ceased, and then there was an interval of dead silence while

the clerk made up his count.  There was a two-thirds vote on the

University side--and two over.



The Speaker--"The rules are suspended, the motion is carried--first

reading of the bill!"



By one impulse the galleries broke forth into stormy applause, and even

some of the members of the House were not wholly able to restrain their

feelings.  The Speaker's gavel came to the rescue and his clear voice

followed:



"Order, gentlemen--!  The House will come to order!  If spectators offend

again, the Sergeant-at-arms will clear the galleries!"



Then he cast his eyes aloft and gazed at some object attentively for a

moment.  All eyes followed the direction of the Speaker's, and then there

was a general titter.  The Speaker said:



"Let the Sergeant-at Arms inform the gentleman that his conduct is an

infringement of the dignity of the House--and one which is not warranted

by the state of the weather."  Poor Sellers was the culprit.  He sat in

the front seat of the gallery, with his arms and his tired body

overflowing the balustrade--sound asleep, dead to all excitements, all

disturbances.  The fluctuations of the Washington weather had influenced

his dreams, perhaps, for during the recent tempest of applause he had

hoisted his gingham umbrella, and calmly gone on with his slumbers.

Washington Hawkins had seen the act, but was not near enough at hand to

save his friend, and no one who was near enough desired to spoil the

effect.  But a neighbor stirred up the Colonel, now that the House had

its eye upon him, and the great speculator furled his tent like the Arab.

He said:



"Bless my soul, I'm so absent-minded when I, get to thinking!  I never

wear an umbrella in the house--did anybody 'notice it'?  What-asleep?

Indeed?  And did you wake me sir?  Thank you--thank you very much indeed.

It might have fallen out of my hands and been injured.  Admirable

article, sir--present from a friend in Hong Kong; one doesn't come across

silk like that in this country--it's the real--Young Hyson, I'm told."



By this time the incident was forgotten, for the House was at war again.

Victory was almost in sight, now, and the friends of the bill threw

themselves into their work with enthusiasm.  They soon moved and carried

its second reading, and after a strong, sharp fight, carried a motion to

go into Committee of the whole.  The Speaker left his place, of course,

and a chairman was appointed.



Now the contest raged hotter than ever--for the authority that compels

order when the House sits as a House, is greatly diminished when it sits

as Committee.  The main fight came upon the filling of the blanks with

the sum to be appropriated for the purchase of the land, of course.



Buckstone--"Mr. Chairman, I move you, sir, that the words 'three millions

of' be inserted."



Mr. Hadley--"Mr. Chairman, I move that the words two and a half dollars

be inserted."



Mr. Clawson--"Mr. Chairman, I move the insertion of the words five and

twenty cents, as representing the true value of this barren and isolated

tract of desolation."



The question, according to rule, was taken upon the smallest sum first.

It was lost.



Then upon the nest smallest sum.  Lost, also.



And then upon the three millions.  After a vigorous battle that lasted a

considerable time, this motion was carried.



Then, clause by clause the bill was read, discussed, and amended in

trifling particulars, and now the Committee rose and reported.



The moment the House had resumed its functions and received the report,

Mr. Buckstone moved and carried the third reading of the bill.



The same bitter war over the sum to be paid was fought over again, and

now that the ayes and nays could be called and placed on record, every

man was compelled to vote by name on the three millions, and indeed on

every paragraph of the bill from the enacting clause straight through.

But as before, the friends of the measure stood firm and voted in a solid

body every time, and so did its enemies.



The supreme moment was come, now, but so sure was the result that not

even a voice was raised to interpose an adjournment.  The enemy were

totally demoralized.  The bill was put upon its final passage almost

without dissent, and the calling of the ayes and nays began.  When it was

ended the triumph was complete--the two-thirds vote held good, and a veto

was impossible, as far as the House was concerned!



Mr. Buckstone resolved that now that the nail was driven home, he would

clinch it on the other side and make it stay forever.  He moved a

reconsideration of the vote by which the bill had passed.  The motion was

lost, of course, and the great Industrial University act was an

accomplished fact as far as it was in the power of the House of

Representatives to make it so.



There was no need to move an adjournment.  The instant the last motion

was decided, the enemies of the University rose and flocked out of the

Hall, talking angrily, and its friends flocked after them jubilant and

congratulatory.  The galleries disgorged their burden, and presently the

house was silent and deserted.



When Col. Sellers and Washington stepped out of the building they were

surprised to find that the daylight was old and the sun well up.  Said

the Colonel:



"Give me your hand, my boy!  You're all right at last!  You're a

millionaire!  At least you're going to be.  The thing is dead sure.

Don't you bother about the Senate.  Leave me and Dilworthy to take care

of that.  Run along home, now, and tell Laura.  Lord, it's magnificent

news--perfectly magnificent!  Run, now.  I'll telegraph my wife.  She

must come here and help me build a house.  Everything's all right now!"



Washington was so dazed by his good fortune and so bewildered by the

gaudy pageant of dreams that was already trailing its long ranks through

his brain, that he wandered he knew not where, and so loitered by the way

that when at last he reached home he woke to a sudden annoyance in the

fact that his news must be old to Laura, now, for of course Senator

Dilworthy must have already been home and told her an hour before.  He

knocked at her door, but there was no answer.



"That is like the Duchess," said he.  "Always cool; a body can't excite

her-can't keep her excited, anyway.  Now she has gone off to sleep again,

as comfortably as if she were used to picking up a million dollars every

day or two"



Then he vent to bed.  But he could not sleep; so he got up and wrote a

long, rapturous letter to Louise, and another to his mother.  And he

closed both to much the same effect:



     "Laura will be queen of America, now, and she will be applauded, and

     honored and petted by the whole nation.  Her name will be in every

     one's mouth more than ever, and how they will court her and quote

     her bright speeches.  And mine, too, I suppose; though they do that

     more already, than they really seem to deserve.  Oh, the world is so

     bright, now, and so cheery; the clouds are all gone, our long

     struggle is ended, our, troubles are all over.  Nothing can ever

     make us unhappy any more.  You dear faithful ones will have the

     reward of your patient waiting now.  How father's Wisdom is proven

     at last!  And how I repent me, that there have been times when I

     lost faith and said, the blessing he stored up for us a tedious

     generation ago was but a long-drawn curse, a blight upon us all.

     But everything is well, now--we are done with poverty, sad toil,

     weariness and heart-break; all the world is filled with sunshine."









CHAPTER XLVI.



Philip left the capitol and walked up Pennsylvania Avenue in company with

Senator Dilworthy.  It was a bright spring morning, the air was soft and

inspiring; in the deepening wayside green, the pink flush of the

blossoming peach trees, the soft suffusion on the heights of Arlington,

and the breath of the warm south wind was apparent, the annual miracle of

the resurrection of the earth.



The Senator took off his hat and seemed to open his soul to the sweet

influences of the morning.  After the heat and noise of the chamber,

under its dull gas-illuminated glass canopy, and the all night struggle

of passion and feverish excitement there, the open, tranquil world seemed

like Heaven.  The Senator was not in an exultant mood, but rather in a

condition of holy joy, befitting a Christian statesman whose benevolent

plans Providence has made its own and stamped with approval.  The great

battle had been fought, but the measure had still to encounter the

scrutiny of the Senate, and Providence sometimes acts differently in the

two Houses.  Still the Senator was tranquil, for he knew that there is an

esprit de corps in the Senate which does not exist in the House, the

effect of which is to make the members complaisant towards the projects

of each other, and to extend a mutual aid which in a more vulgar body

would be called "log-rolling."



"It is, under Providence, a good night's work, Mr. Sterling.  The

government has founded an institution which will remove half the

difficulty from the southern problem.  And it is a good thing for the

Hawkins heirs, a very good thing.  Laura will be almost a millionaire."



"Do you think, Mr. Dilworthy, that the Hawkinses will get much of the

money?" asked Philip innocently, remembering the fate of the Columbus

River appropriation.



The Senator looked at his companion scrutinizingly for a moment to see if

he meant any thing personal, and then replied,



"Undoubtedly, undoubtedly.  I have had their interests greatly at heart.

There will of course be a few expenses, but the widow and orphans will

realize all that Mr. Hawkins, dreamed of for them."



The birds were singing as they crossed the Presidential Square, now

bright with its green turf and tender foliage.  After the two had gained

the steps of the Senator's house they stood a moment, looking upon the

lovely prospect:



"It is like the peace of God," said the Senator devoutly.



Entering the house, the Senator called a servant and said, "Tell Miss

Laura that we are waiting to see her.  I ought to have sent a messenger

on horseback half an hour ago," he added to Philip, "she will be

transported with our victory.  You must stop to breakfast, and see the

excitement."  The servant soon came back, with a wondering look and

reported,



"Miss Laura ain't dah, sah.  I reckon she hain't been dah all night!"



The Senator and Philip both started up.  In Laura's room there were the

marks of a confused and hasty departure, drawers half open, little

articles strewn on the floor.  The bed had not been disturbed.  Upon

inquiry it appeared that Laura had not been at dinner, excusing herself

to Mrs. Dilworthy on the plea of a violent headache; that she made a

request to the servants that she might not be disturbed.



The Senator was astounded.  Philip thought at once of Col. Selby.  Could

Laura have run away with him?  The Senator thought not.  In fact it could

not be.  Gen. Leffenwell, the member from New Orleans, had casually told

him at the house last night that Selby and his family went to New York

yesterday morning and were to sail for Europe to-day.



Philip had another idea which, he did not mention.  He seized his hat,

and saying that he would go and see what he could learn, ran to the

lodgings of Harry; whom he had not seen since yesterday afternoon, when

he left him to go to the House.



Harry was not in.  He had gone out with a hand-bag before six o'clock

yesterday, saying that he had to go to New York, but should return next

day.  In Harry's-room on the table Philip found this note:



          "Dear Mr. Brierly:--Can you meet me at the six o'clock train,

          and be my escort to New York?  I have to go about this

          University bill, the vote of an absent member we must have

          here, Senator Dilworthy cannot go.

                                             Yours,  L.  H."



"Confound it," said Phillip, "the noodle has fallen into her trap.  And

she promised she would let him alone."



He only stopped to send a note to Senator Dilworthy, telling him what he

had found, and that he should go at once to New York, and then hastened

to the railway station.  He had to wait an hour for a train, and when it

did start it seemed to go at a snail's pace.



Philip was devoured with anxiety.  Where could they, have gone?  What was

Laura's object in taking Harry?  Had the flight anything to do with

Selby?  Would Harry be such a fool as to be dragged into some public

scandal?



It seemed as if the train would never reach Baltimore.  Then there was a

long delay at Havre de Grace.  A hot box had to be cooled at Wilmington.

Would it never get on?  Only in passing around the city of Philadelphia

did the train not seem to go slow.  Philip stood upon the platform and

watched for the Boltons' house, fancied he could distinguish its roof

among the trees, and wondered how Ruth would feel if she knew he was so

near her.



Then came Jersey, everlasting Jersey, stupid irritating Jersey, where the

passengers are always asking which line they are on, and where they are

to come out, and whether they have yet reached Elizabeth.  Launched into

Jersey, one has a vague notion that he is on many lines and no one in

particular, and that he is liable at any moment to come to Elizabeth.

He has no notion what Elizabeth is, and always resolves that the next

time he goes that way, he will look out of the window and see what it is

like; but he never does.  Or if he does, he probably finds that it is

Princeton or something of that sort.  He gets annoyed, and never can see

the use of having different names for stations in Jersey.  By and by.

there is Newark, three or four Newarks apparently; then marshes; then

long rock cuttings devoted to the advertisements of 'patent medicines and

ready-made, clothing, and New York tonics for Jersey agues, and Jersey

City is reached.



On the ferry-boat Philip bought an evening paper from a boy crying

"'Ere's the Evening Gram, all about the murder," and with breathless

haste--ran his eyes over the following:



                            SHOCKING MURDER!!!



     TRAGEDY IN HIGH LIFE!!  A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHOOTS A DISTINGUISHED

     CONFEDERATE SOLDIER AT THE SOUTHERN HOTEL!!!  JEALOUSY THE CAUSE!!!



     This morning occurred another of those shocking murders which have

     become the almost daily food of the newspapers, the direct result of

     the socialistic doctrines and woman's rights agitations, which have

     made every woman the avenger of her own wrongs, and all society the

     hunting ground for her victims.



     About nine o'clock a lady deliberately shot a man dead in the public

     parlor of the Southern Hotel, coolly remarking, as she threw down

     her revolver and permitted herself to be taken into custody, "He

     brought it on himself."  Our reporters were immediately dispatched

     to the scene of the tragedy, and gathered the following particulars.



     Yesterday afternoon arrived at the hotel from Washington, Col.

     George Selby and family, who had taken passage and were to sail at

     noon to-day in the steamer Scotia for England.  The Colonel was a

     handsome man about forty, a gentleman Of wealth and high social

     position, a resident of New Orleans.  He served with distinction in

     the confederate army, and received a wound in the leg from which he

     has never entirely recovered, being obliged to use a cane in

     locomotion.



     This morning at about nine o'clock, a lady, accompanied by a

     gentleman, called at the office Of the hotel and asked for Col.

     Selby.  The Colonel was at breakfast.  Would the clerk tell him that

     a lady and gentleman wished to see him for a moment in the parlor?

     The clerk says that the gentleman asked her, "What do you want to

     see him for?" and that she replied, "He is going to Europe, and I

     ought to just say good by."



     Col. Selby was informed; and the lady and gentleman were shown to

     the parlor, in which were at the time three or four other persons.

     Five minutes after two shots were fired in quick succession, and

     there was a rush to the parlor from which the reports came.



     Col. Selby was found lying on the floor, bleeding, but not dead.

     Two gentlemen, who had just come in, had seized the lady, who made

     no resistance, and she was at once given in charge of a police

     officer who arrived.  The persons who were in the parlor agree

     substantially as to what occurred.  They had happened to be looking

     towards the door when the man--Col. Selby--entered with his cane,

     and they looked at him, because he stopped as if surprised and

     frightened, and made a backward movement. At the same moment the

     lady in the bonnet advanced towards him and said something like,

     "George, will you go with me?"  He replied, throwing up his hand and

     retreating, "My God I can't, don't fire," and the next instants two

     shots were heard and he fell.  The lady appeared to be beside

     herself with rage or excitement, and trembled very much when the

     gentlemen took hold of her; it was to them she said, "He brought it

     on himself."



     Col. Selby was carried at once to his room and Dr. Puffer, the

     eminent surgeon was sent for.  It was found that he was shot through

     the breast and through the abdomen.  Other aid was summoned, but the

     wounds were mortal, and Col Selby expired in an hour, in pain, but

     his mind was clear to the last and he made a full deposition.  The

     substance of it was that his murderess is a Miss Laura Hawkins, whom

     he had known at Washington as a lobbyist and had some business with

     her.  She had followed him with her attentions and solicitations,

     and had endeavored to make him desert his wife and go to Europe with

     her.  When he resisted and avoided her she had threatened him.  Only

     the day before he left Washington she had declared that he should

     never go out of the city alive without her.



     It seems to have been a deliberate and premeditated murder, the

     woman following him to Washington on purpose to commit it.



     We learn that the, murderess, who is a woman of dazzling and

     transcendent beauty and about twenty six or seven, is a niece of

     Senator Dilworthy at whose house she has been spending the winter.

     She belongs to a high Southern family, and has the reputation of

     being an heiress. Like some other great beauties and belles in

     Washington however there have been whispers that she had something

     to do with the lobby.  If we mistake not we have heard her name

     mentioned in connection with the sale of the Tennessee Lands to the

     Knobs University, the bill for which passed the House last night.



     Her companion is Mr. Harry Brierly, a New York dandy, who has been

     in Washington. His connection with her and with this tragedy is not

     known, but he was also taken into custody, and will be detained at

     least as a witness.



     P. S.  One of the persons present in the parlor says that after

     Laura Hawkins had fired twice, she turned the pistol towards

     herself, but that Brierly sprung and caught it from her hand, and

     that it was he who threw it on the floor.



     Further particulars with full biographies of all the parties in our

     next edition.



Philip hastened at once to the Southern Hotel, where he found still a

great state of excitement, and a thousand different and exaggerated

stories passing from mouth to mouth.  The witnesses of the event had told

it over so many time that they had worked it up into a most dramatic

scene, and embellished it with whatever could heighten its awfulness.

Outsiders had taken up invention also.  The Colonel's wife had gone

insane, they said.  The children had rushed into the parlor and rolled

themselves in their father's blood.  The hotel clerk said that he noticed

there was murder in the woman's eye when he saw her.  A person who had

met the woman on the stairs felt a creeping sensation.  Some thought

Brierly was an accomplice, and that he had set the woman on to kill his

rival.  Some said the woman showed the calmness and indifference of

insanity.



Philip learned that Harry and Laura had both been taken to the city

prison, and he went there; but he was not admitted.  Not being a

newspaper reporter, he could not see either of them that night; but the

officer questioned him suspiciously and asked him who he was.  He might

perhaps see Brierly in the morning.



The latest editions of the evening papers had the result of the inquest.

It was a plain enough case for the jury, but they sat over it a long

time, listening to the wrangling of the physicians.  Dr. Puffer insisted

that the man died from the effects of the wound in the chest.  Dr. Dobb

as strongly insisted that the wound in the abdomen caused death.  Dr.

Golightly suggested that in his opinion death ensued from a complication

of the two wounds and perhaps other causes.  He examined the table

waiter, as to whether Col. Selby ate any breakfast, and what he ate, and

if he had any appetite.



The jury finally threw themselves back upon the indisputable fact that

Selby was dead, that either wound would have killed him (admitted by the

doctors), and rendered a verdict that he died from pistol-shot wounds

inflicted by a pistol in the hands of Laura Hawkins.



The morning papers blazed with big type, and overflowed with details of

the murder.  The accounts in the evening papers were only the premonitory

drops to this mighty shower.  The scene was dramatically worked up in

column after column.  There were sketches, biographical and historical.

There were long "specials" from Washington, giving a full history of

Laura's career there, with the names of men with whom she was said to be

intimate, a description of Senator Dilworthy's residence and of his

family, and of Laura's room in his house, and a sketch of the Senator's

appearance and what he said.  There was a great deal about her beauty,

her accomplishments and her brilliant position in society, and her

doubtful position in society.  There was also an interview with Col.

Sellers and another with Washington Hawkins, the brother of the

murderess.  One journal had a long dispatch from Hawkeye, reporting the

excitement in that quiet village and the reception of the awful

intelligence.



All the parties had been "interviewed."  There were reports of

conversations with the clerk at the hotel; with the call-boy; with the

waiter at table with all the witnesses, with the policeman, with the

landlord (who wanted it understood that nothing of that sort had ever

happened in his house before, although it had always been frequented by

the best Southern society,) and with Mrs. Col. Selby.  There were

diagrams illustrating the scene of the shooting, and views of the hotel

and street, and portraits of the parties.  There were three minute and

different statements from the doctors about the wounds, so technically

worded that nobody could understand them.  Harry and Laura had also been

"interviewed" and there was a statement from Philip himself, which a

reporter had knocked him up out of bed at midnight to give, though how he

found him, Philip never could conjecture.



What some of the journals lacked in suitable length for the occasion,

they made up in encyclopaedic information about other similar murders and

shootings.



The statement from Laura was not full, in fact it was fragmentary, and

consisted of nine parts of, the reporter's valuable observations to one

of Laura's, and it was, as the reporter significantly remarked,

"incoherent", but it appeared that Laura claimed to be Selby's wife,

or to have been his wife, that he had deserted her and betrayed her, and

that she was going to follow him to Europe.  When the reporter asked:



"What made you shoot him Miss. Hawkins?"



Laura's only reply was, very simply,



"Did I shoot him?  Do they say I shot him?".  And she would say no more.



The news of the murder was made the excitement of the day. Talk of it

filled the town.  The facts reported were scrutinized, the standing of

the parties was discussed, the dozen different theories of the motive,

broached in the newspapers, were disputed over.



During the night subtle electricity had carried the tale over all the

wires of the continent and under the sea; and in all villages and towns

of the Union, from the.  Atlantic to the territories, and away up and

down the Pacific slope, and as far as London and Paris and Berlin, that

morning the name of Laura Hawkins was spoken by millions and millions of

people, while the owner of it--the sweet child of years ago, the

beautiful queen of Washington drawing rooms--sat shivering on her cot-bed

in the darkness of a damp cell in the Tombs.









CHAPTER XLVII.



Philip's first effort was to get Harry out of the Tombs.  He gained

permission to see him, in the presence of an officer, during the day,

and he found that hero very much cast down.



"I never intended to come to such a place as this, old fellow," he said

to Philip; "it's no place for a gentleman, they've no idea how to treat a

gentleman.  Look at that provender," pointing to his uneaten prison

ration.  "They tell me I am detained as a witness, and I passed the night

among a lot of cut-throats and dirty rascals--a pretty witness I'd be in

a month spent in such company."



"But what under heavens," asked Philip, "induced you to come to New York

with Laura!  What was it for?"



"What for?  Why, she wanted me to come.  I didn't know anything about

that cursed Selby.  She said it was lobby business for the University.

I'd no idea what she was dragging me into that confounded hotel for.

I suppose she knew that the Southerners all go there, and thought she'd

find her man.  Oh!  Lord, I wish I'd taken your advice.  You might as

well murder somebody and have the credit of it, as get into the

newspapers the way I have.  She's pure devil, that girl.  You ought to

have seen how sweet she was on me; what an ass I am."



"Well, I'm not going to dispute a poor, prisoner.  But the first thing is

to get you out of this.  I've brought the note Laura wrote you, for one

thing, and I've seen your uncle, and explained the truth of the case to

him.  He will be here soon."



Harry's uncle came, with; other friends, and in the course of the day

made such a showing to the authorities that Harry was released, on giving

bonds to appear as a witness when wanted.  His spirits rose with their

usual elasticity as soon as he was out of Centre Street, and he insisted

on giving Philip and his friends a royal supper at Delmonico's, an excess

which was perhaps excusable in the rebound of his feelings, and which was

committed with his usual reckless generosity.  Harry ordered, the supper,

and it is perhaps needless to say, that Philip paid the bill.



Neither of the young men felt like attempting to see Laura that day,

and she saw no company except the newspaper reporters, until the arrival

of  Col. Sellers and Washington Hawkins, who had hastened to New York

with all speed.



They found Laura in a cell in the upper tier of the women's department.

The cell was somewhat larger than those in the men's department, and

might be eight feet by ten square, perhaps a little longer.  It was of

stone, floor and all, and tile roof was oven shaped.  A narrow slit in

the roof admitted sufficient light, and was the only means of

ventilation; when the window was opened there was nothing to prevent the

rain coming in.  The only means of heating being from the corridor, when

the door was ajar, the cell was chilly and at this time damp.  It was

whitewashed and clean, but it had a slight jail odor; its only furniture

was a narrow iron bedstead, with a tick of straw and some blankets, not

too clean.



When Col. Sellers was conducted to this cell by the matron and looked

in, his emotions quite overcame him, the tears rolled down his cheeks and

his voice trembled so that he could hardly speak.  Washington was unable

to say anything; he looked from Laura to the miserable creatures who were

walking in the corridor with unutterable disgust.  Laura was alone calm

and self-contained, though she was not unmoved by the sight of the grief

of her friends.



"Are you comfortable, Laura?" was the first word the Colonel could get

out.



"You see," she replied.  "I can't say it's exactly comfortable."



"Are you cold?"



"It is pretty chilly.  The stone floor is like ice.  It chills me through

to step on it.  I have to sit on the bed."



"Poor thing, poor thing.  And can you eat any thing?"



"No, I am not hungry.  I don't know that I could eat any thing, I can't

eat that."



"Oh dear," continued the Colonel, "it's dreadful.  But cheer up, dear,

cheer up;" and the Colonel broke down entirely.



"But," he went on, "we'll stand by you.  We'll do everything for you.

I know you couldn't have meant to do it, it must have been insanity, you

know, or something of that sort.  You never did anything of the sort

before."



Laura smiled very faintly and said,



"Yes, it was something of that sort.  It's all a whirl.  He was a

villain; you don't know."



"I'd rather have killed him myself, in a duel you know, all fair.  I wish

I had.  But don't you be down.  We'll get you the best counsel, the

lawyers in New York can do anything; I've read of cases.  But you must be

comfortable now.  We've brought some of your clothes, at the hotel.  What

else, can we get for you?"



Laura suggested that she would like some sheets for her bed, a piece of

carpet to step on, and her meals sent in; and some books and writing

materials if it was allowed.  The Colonel and Washington promised to

procure all these things, and then took their sorrowful leave, a great

deal more affected than the criminal was, apparently, by her situation.



The colonel told the matron as he went away that if she would look to

Laura's comfort a little it shouldn't be the worse for her; and to the

turnkey who let them out he patronizingly said,



"You've got a big establishment here, a credit to the city.  I've got a

friend in there--I shall see you again, sir."



By the next day something more of Laura's own story began to appear in

the newspapers, colored and heightened by reporters' rhetoric.  Some of

them cast a lurid light upon the Colonel's career, and represented his

victim as a beautiful avenger of her murdered innocence; and others

pictured her as his willing paramour and pitiless slayer.  Her

communications to the reporters were stopped by her lawyers as soon as

they were retained and visited her, but this fact did not prevent--it may

have facilitated--the appearance of casual paragraphs here and there

which were likely to beget popular sympathy for the poor girl.



The occasion did not pass without "improvement" by the leading journals;

and Philip preserved the editorial comments of three or four of them

which pleased him most.  These he used to read aloud to his friends

afterwards and ask them to guess from which journal each of them had been

cut.  One began in this simple manner:--



     History never repeats itself, but the Kaleidoscopic combinations of

     the pictured present often seem to be constructed out of the broken

     fragments of antique legends.  Washington is not Corinth, and Lais,

     the beautiful daughter of Timandra, might not have been the

     prototype of the ravishing Laura, daughter of the plebeian house of

     Hawkins; but the orators add statesmen who were the purchasers of

     the favors of the one, may have been as incorruptible as the

     Republican statesmen who learned how to love and how to vote from

     the sweet lips of the Washington lobbyist; and perhaps the modern

     Lais would never have departed from the national Capital if there

     had been there even one republican Xenocrates who resisted her

     blandishments.  But here the parallel: fails.  Lais, wandering away

     with the youth Rippostratus, is slain by the women who are jealous

     of her charms. Laura, straying into her Thessaly with the youth

     Brierly, slays her other lover and becomes the champion of the

     wrongs of her sex.



Another journal began its editorial with less lyrical beauty, but with

equal force.  It closed as follows:--



     With Laura Hawkins, fair, fascinating and fatal, and with the

     dissolute Colonel of a lost cause, who has reaped the harvest he

     sowed, we have nothing to do.  But as the curtain rises on this

     awful tragedy, we catch a glimpse of the society at the capital

     under this Administration, which we cannot contemplate without alarm

     for the fate of the Republic.



A third newspaper took up the subject in a different tone.  It said:--



     Our repeated predictions are verified.  The pernicious doctrines

     which we have announced as prevailing in American society have been

     again illustrated.  The name of the city is becoming a reproach.

     We may have done something in averting its ruin in our resolute

     exposure of the Great Frauds; we shall not be deterred from

     insisting that the outraged laws for the protection of human life

     shall be vindicated now, so that a person can walk the streets or

     enter the public houses, at least in the day-time, without the risk

     of a bullet through his brain.



A fourth journal began its remarks as follows:--



     The fullness with which we present our readers this morning the

     details of the Selby-Hawkins homicide is a miracle of modern

     journalism.  Subsequent investigation can do little to fill out the

     picture.  It is the old story.  A beautiful woman shoots her

     absconding lover in cold-blood; and we shall doubtless learn in due

     time that if she was not as mad as a hare in this month of March,

     she was at least laboring under what is termed "momentary insanity."



It would not be too much to say that upon the first publication of the

facts of the tragedy, there was an almost universal feeling of rage

against the murderess in the Tombs, and that reports of her beauty only

heightened the indignation.  It was as if she presumed upon that and upon

her sex, to defy the law; and there was a fervent, hope that the law

would take its plain course.



Yet Laura was not without friends, and some of them very influential too.

She had in keeping a great many secrets and a great many reputations,

perhaps.  Who shall set himself up to judge human motives.  Why, indeed,

might we not feel pity for a woman whose brilliant career had been so

suddenly extinguished in misfortune and crime?  Those who had known her

so well in Washington might find it impossible to believe that the

fascinating woman could have had murder in her heart, and would readily

give ear to the current sentimentality about the temporary aberration of

mind under the stress of personal calamity.



Senator Dilworthy, was greatly shocked, of course, but he was full of

charity for the erring.



"We shall all need mercy," he said.  "Laura as an inmate of my family was

a most exemplary female, amiable, affectionate and truthful, perhaps too

fond of gaiety, and neglectful of the externals of religion, but a woman

of principle.  She may have had experiences of which I am ignorant, but

she could not have gone to this extremity if she had been in her own

right mind."



To the Senator's credit be it said, he was willing to help Laura and her

family in this dreadful trial.  She, herself, was not without money, for

the Washington lobbyist is not seldom more fortunate than the Washington

claimant, and she was able to procure a good many luxuries to mitigate

the severity of her prison life.  It enabled her also to have her own

family near her, and to see some of them daily.  The tender solicitude of

her mother, her childlike grief, and her firm belief in the real

guiltlessness of her daughter, touched even the custodians of the Tombs

who are enured to scenes of pathos.



Mrs. Hawkins had hastened to her daughter as soon as she received money

for the journey.  She had no reproaches, she had only tenderness and

pity.  She could not shut out the dreadful facts of the case, but it had

been enough for her that Laura had said, in their first interview,

"mother, I did not know what I was doing."  She obtained lodgings near,

the prison and devoted her life to her daughter, as if she had been

really her own child.  She would have remained in the prison day and

night if it had been permitted.  She was aged and feeble, but this great

necessity seemed to give her new life.



The pathetic story of the old lady's ministrations, and her simplicity

and faith, also got into the newspapers in time, and probably added to

the pathos of this wrecked woman's fate, which was beginning to be felt

by the public.  It was certain that she had champions who thought that

her wrongs ought to be placed against her crime, and expressions of this

feeling came to her in various ways.  Visitors came to see her, and gifts

of fruit and flowers were sent, which brought some cheer into her hard

and gloomy cell.



Laura had declined to see either Philip or Harry, somewhat to the

former's relief, who had a notion that she would necessarily feel

humiliated by seeing him after breaking faith with him, but to the

discomfiture of Harry, who still felt her fascination, and thought her

refusal heartless.  He told Philip that of course he had got through with

such a woman, but he wanted to see her.



Philip, to keep him from some new foolishness, persuaded him to go with

him to Philadelphia; and, give his valuable services in the mining

operations at Ilium.



The law took its course with Laura.  She was indicted for murder in the

first degree and held for trial at the summer term.  The two most

distinguished criminal lawyers in the city had been retained for her

defence, and to that the resolute woman devoted her days with a courage

that rose as she consulted with her counsel and understood the methods of

criminal procedure in New York.



She was greatly depressed, however, by the news from Washington.

Congress adjourned and her bill had failed to pass the Senate.  It must

wait for the next session.









CHAPTER XLVIII



It had been a bad winter, somehow, for the firm of Pennybacker, Bigler

and Small.  These celebrated contractors usually made more money during

the session of the legislature at Harrisburg than upon all their summer

work, and this winter had been unfruitful.  It was unaccountable to

Bigler.



"You see, Mr. Bolton," he said, and Philip was present at the

conversation, "it puts us all out.  It looks as if politics was played

out.  We'd counted on the year of Simon's re-election.  And, now, he's

reelected, and I've yet to see the first man who's the better for it."



"You don't mean to say," asked Philip, "that he went in without paying

anything?"



"Not a cent, not a dash cent, as I can hear," repeated Mr. Bigler,

indignantly.  "I call it a swindle on the state.  How it was done gets

me.  I never saw such a tight time for money in Harrisburg."



"Were there no combinations, no railroad jobs, no mining schemes put

through in connection with the election?



"Not that I knew," said Bigler, shaking his head in disgust.  "In fact it

was openly said, that there was no money in the election.  It's perfectly

unheard of."



"Perhaps," suggested Philip, "it was effected on what the insurance

companies call the 'endowment,' or the 'paid up' plan, by which a policy

is secured after a certain time without further payment."



"You think then," said Mr. Bolton smiling, "that a liberal and sagacious

politician might own a legislature after a time, and not be bothered with

keeping up his payments?"



"Whatever it is," interrupted Mr. Bigler, "it's devilish ingenious and

goes ahead of my calculations; it's cleaned me out, when I thought we had

a dead sure thing.  I tell you what it is, gentlemen, I shall go in for

reform.  Things have got pretty mixed when a legislature will give away a

United States senatorship."



It was melancholy, but Mr. Bigler was not a man to be crushed by one

misfortune, or to lose his confidence in human nature, on one exhibition

of apparent honesty.  He was already on his feet again, or would be if

Mr. Bolton could tide him over shoal water for ninety days.



"We've got something with money in it," he explained to Mr. Bolton,

"got hold of it by good luck.  We've got the entire contract for Dobson's

Patent Pavement for the city of Mobile.  See here."



Mr. Bigler made some figures; contract so; much, cost of work and

materials so much, profits so much.  At the end of three months the city

would owe the company three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars-two

hundred thousand of that would be profits.  The whole job was worth at

least a million to the company--it might be more.  There could be no

mistake in these figures; here was the contract, Mr. Bolton knew what

materials were worth and what the labor would cost.



Mr. Bolton knew perfectly well from sore experience that there was always

a mistake in figures when Bigler or Small made them, and he knew that he

ought to send the fellow about his business.  Instead of that, he let him

talk.



They only wanted to raise fifty thousand dollars to carry on the

contract--that expended they would have city bonds.  Mr. Bolton said he

hadn't the money.  But Bigler could raise it on his name.  Mr. Bolton

said he had no right to put his family to that risk.  But the entire

contract could be assigned to him--the security was ample--it was a

fortune to him if it was forfeited.  Besides Mr. Bigler had been

unfortunate, he didn't know where to look for the necessaries of life for

his family.  If he could only have one more chance, he was sure he could

right himself.  He begged for it.



And Mr. Bolton yielded.  He could never refuse such appeals.  If he had

befriended a man once and been cheated by him, that man appeared to have

a claim upon him forever.  He shrank, however, from telling his wife what

he had done on this occasion, for he knew that if any person was more

odious than Small to his family it was Bigler.



"Philip tells me," Mrs. Bolton said that evening, "that the man Bigler

has been with thee again to-day.  I hope thee will have nothing more to

do with him."



He has been very unfortunate," replied Mr. Bolton, uneasily.



"He is always unfortunate, and he is always getting thee into trouble.

But thee didn't listen to him again?"



"Well, mother, his family is in want, and I lent him my name--but I took

ample security.  The worst that can happen will be a little

inconvenience."



Mrs. Bolton looked grave and anxious, but she did not complain or

remonstrate; she knew what a "little inconvenience" meant, but she knew

there was no help for it.  If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to

buy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in

his pocket, he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for

it.  Mrs. Bolton only asked (and the question showed that she was no mere

provident than her husband where her heart was interested),



"But has thee provided money for Philip to use in opening the coal mine?"



"Yes, I have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine,

as much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found.  Philip has the

control of it, as equal partner in the venture, deducting the capital

invested.  He has great confidence in his success, and I hope for his

sake he won't be disappointed."



Philip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the

Bolton-family--by all except Ruth.  His mother, when he went home after

his recovery from his accident, had affected to be very jealous of Mrs.

Bolton, about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions--

an affectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache,

which comes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and

forms new ties.  And to Mrs. Sterling; a widow, living on a small income

in a remote Massachusetts village, Philadelphia was a city of many

splendors.  All its inhabitants seemed highly favored, dwelling in ease

and surrounded by superior advantages.  Some of her neighbors had

relations living in Philadelphia, and it seemed to them somehow a

guarantee of respectability to have relations in Philadelphia.

Mrs. Sterling was not sorry to have Philip make his way among such well-

to-do people, and she was sure that no good fortune could be too good for

his deserts.



"So, sir," said Ruth, when Philip came from New York, "you have been

assisting in a pretty tragedy.  I saw your name in the papers.  Is this

woman a specimen of your western friends?"



"My only assistance," replied Philip, a little annoyed, was in trying to

keep Harry out of a bad scrape, and I failed after all.  He walked into

her trap, and he has been punished for it.  I'm going to take him up to

Ilium to see if he won't work steadily at one thing, and quit his

nonsense."



"Is she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is?"



"I don't know, she has a kind of beauty--she is not like--'



"Not like Alice?"



"Well, she is brilliant; she was called the handsomest woman in

Washington--dashing, you know, and sarcastic and witty.  Ruth, do you

believe a woman ever becomes a devil?"



"Men do, and I don't know why women shouldn't.  But I never saw one."



"Well, Laura Hawkins comes very near it.  But it is dreadful to think of

her fate."



"Why, do you suppose they will hang a woman?  Do you suppose they will be

so barbarous as that?"



"I wasn't thinking of that--it's doubtful if a New York jury would find a

woman guilty of any such crime.  But to think of her life if she is

acquitted."



"It is dreadful," said Ruth, thoughtfully, "but the worst of it is that

you men do not want women educated to do anything, to be able to earn an

honest living by their own exertions.  They are educated as if they were

always to be petted and supported, and there was never to be any such

thing as misfortune.  I suppose, now, that you would all choose to have

me stay idly at home, and give up my profession."



"Oh, no," said Philip, earnestly, "I  respect your resolution.  But,

Ruth, do you think you would be happier or do more good in following your

profession than in having a home of your own?"



"What is to hinder having a home of my, own?"



"Nothing, perhaps, only you never would be in it--you would be away day

and night, if you had any practice; and what sort of a home would that

make for your husband?"



"What sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away

riding about in his doctor's gig?"



"Ah, you know that is not fair.  The woman makes the home."



Philip and Ruth often had this sort of discussion, to which Philip was

always trying to give a personal turn.  He was now about to go to Ilium

for the season, and he did not like to go without some assurance from

Ruth that she might perhaps love him some day; when he was worthy of it,

and when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his

poverty.



"I should work with a great deal better heart, Ruth," he said the morning

he was taking leave, "if I knew you cared for me a little."



Ruth was looking down; the color came faintly to her cheeks, and she

hesitated.  She needn't be looking down, he thought, for she was ever so

much shorter than tall Philip.



"It's not much of a place, Ilium," Philip went on, as if a little

geographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else, "and I

shall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken,

and--" his observation did not seem to be coming out any where.



But Ruth looked up, and there was a light in her eyes that quickened

Phil's pulse.  She took his hand, and said with serious sweetness:



"Thee mustn't lose heart, Philip."  And then she added, in another mood,

"Thee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma.  And if

any thing happens--mines explode sometimes--thee can send for me.

Farewell."



The opening of the Ilium coal mine was begun with energy, but without

many omens of success.  Philip was running a tunnel into the breast of

the mountain, in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought to.

How far he must go in he believed he knew, but no one could tell exactly.

Some of the miners said that they should probably go through the

mountain, and that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel.  The

mining camp was a busy place at any rate.  Quite a settlement of board

and log shanties had gone up, with a blacksmith shop, a small machine

shop, and a temporary store for supplying the wants of the workmen.

Philip and Harry pitched a commodious tent, and lived in the full

enjoyment of the free life.



There is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground, if you have money

enough to pay for the digging, but those who try this sort of work are

always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a small

hole.  The earth is never willing to yield one product, hidden in her

bosom, without an equivalent for it.  And when a person asks of her coal,

she is quite apt to require gold in exchange.



It was exciting work for all concerned in it.  As the tunnel advanced

into the rock every day promised to be the golden day.  This very blast

might disclose the treasure.



The work went on week after week, and at length during the night as well

as the daytime.  Gangs relieved each other, and the tunnel was every

hour, inch by inch and foot by foot, crawling into the mountain.  Philip

was on the stretch of hope and excitement.  Every pay day he saw his

funds melting away, and still there was only the faintest show of what

the miners call "signs."



The life suited Harry, whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed.

He made endless calculations, which nobody could understand, of the

probable position of the vein.  He stood about among the workmen with the

busiest air.  When he was down at Ilium he called himself the engineer of

the works, and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the Dutch

landlord on the hotel porch, and astonishing the idlers there with the

stories of his railroad operations in Missouri.  He talked with the

landlord, too, about enlarging his hotel, and about buying some village

lots, in the prospect of a rise, when the mine was opened.  He taught the

Dutchman how to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time, and

had a bill at the hotel, the growing length of which Mr. Dusenheimer

contemplated with pleasant anticipations.  Mr. Brierly was a very useful

and cheering person wherever he went.



Midsummer arrived: Philip could report to Mr. Bolton only progress, and

this was not a cheerful message for him to send to Philadelphia in reply

to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious.  Philip

himself was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out

before the coal was struck.



At this time Harry was summoned to New York, to attend the trial of Laura

Hawkins.  It was possible that Philip would have to go also, her lawyer

wrote, but they hoped for a postponement.  There was important evidence

that they could not yet obtain, and he hoped the judge would not force

them to a trial unprepared.  There were many reasons for a delay, reasons

which of course are never mentioned, but which it would seem that a New

York judge sometimes must understand, when he grants a postponement upon

a motion that seems to the public altogether inadequate.



Harry went, but he soon came back.  The trial was put off.  Every week we

can gain, said the learned counsel, Braham, improves our chances.  The

popular rage never lasts long.









CHAPTER XLIX.



"We've struck it!"



This was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a

sound sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in

a trice.



"What!  Where is it?  When?  Coal?  Let me see it.  What quality is it?"

were some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly

dressed.  "Harry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming.  Struck it,

eh?  Let's see?"



The foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump.  There

was no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and its

freshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished steel.

Diamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip.



Harry was exuberant, but Philip's natural caution found expression in his

next remark.



"Now, Roberts, you are sure about this?"



"What--sure that it's coal?"



"O, no, sure that it's the main vein."



"Well, yes.  We took it to be that"



"Did you from the first?"



"I can't say we did at first.  No, we didn't.  Most of the indications

were there, but not all of them, not all of them.  So we thought we'd

prospect a bit."



"Well?"



"It was tolerable thick, and looked as if it might be the vein--looked as

if it ought to be the vein.  Then we went down on it a little.  Looked

better all the time."



"When did you strike it?"



"About ten o'clock."



"Then you've been prospecting about four hours."



"Yes, been sinking on it something over four hours."



"I'm afraid you couldn't go down very far in four hours--could you?"



"O yes--it's a good deal broke up, nothing but picking and gadding

stuff."



"Well, it does look encouraging, sure enough--but then the lacking

indications--"



"I'd rather we had them, Mr. Sterling, but I've seen more than one good

permanent mine struck without 'em in my time."



"Well, that is encouraging too."



"Yes, there was the Union, the Alabama and the Black Mohawk--all good,

sound mines, you know--all just exactly like this one when we first

struck them."



"Well, I begin to feel a good deal more easy.  I guess we've really got

it.  I remember hearing them tell about the Black Mohawk."



"I'm free to say that I believe it, and the men all think so too.  They

are all old hands at this business."



"Come Harry, let's go up and look at it, just for the comfort of it,"

said Philip.  They came back in the course of an hour, satisfied and

happy.



There was no more sleep for them that night.  They lit their pipes, put a

specimen of the coal on the table, and made it a kind of loadstone of

thought and conversation.



"Of course," said Harry, "there will have to be a branch track built, and

a 'switch-back' up the hill."



"Yes, there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now.  We

could sell-out tomorrow for a handsome sum.  That sort of coal doesn't go

begging within a mile of a rail-road.  I wonder if Mr. Bolton' would

rather sell out or work it?"



"Oh, work it," says Harry, "probably the whole mountain is coal now

you've got to it."



"Possibly it might not be much of a vein after all," suggested Philip.



"Possibly it is; I'll bet it's forty feet thick.  I told you.  I knew the

sort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it."



Philip's next thought was to write to his friends and announce their good

fortune.  To Mr. Bolton he wrote a short, business letter, as calm as he

could make it.  They had found coal of excellent quality, but they could

not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was.  The prospecting

was still going on.  Philip also wrote to Ruth; but though this letter

may have glowed, it was not with the heat of burning anthracite.  He

needed no artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his ardor when he

sat down to write to Ruth.  But it must be confessed that the words never

flowed so easily before, and he ran on for an hour disporting in all the

extravagance of his imagination.  When Ruth read it, she doubted if the

fellow had not gone out of his senses.  And it was not until she reached

the postscript that she discovered the cause of the exhilaration.

"P. S.--We have found coal."



The news couldn't have come to Mr. Bolton in better time.  He had never

been so sorely pressed.  A dozen schemes which he had in hand, any one

of which might turn up a fortune, all languished, and each needed just

a little more, money to save that which had been invested.  He hadn't

a piece of real estate that was not covered with mortgages, even to the

wild tract which Philip was experimenting on, and which had, no

marketable value above the incumbrance on it.



He had come home that day early, unusually dejected.



"I am afraid," he said to his wife, "that we shall have to give up our

house.  I don't care for myself, but for thee and the children."



"That will be the least of misfortunes," said Mrs. Bolton, cheerfully,

"if thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety, which is wearing thee

out, we can live any where.  Thee knows we were never happier than when

we were in a much humbler home."



"The truth is, Margaret, that affair of Bigler and Small's has come on me

just when I couldn't stand another ounce.  They have made another failure

of it.  I might have known they would; and the sharpers, or fools, I

don't know which, have contrived to involve me for three times as much as

the first obligation.  The security is in my hands, but it is good for

nothing to me.  I have not the money to do anything with the contract."



Ruth heard this dismal news without great surprise.  She had long felt

that they were living on a volcano, that might go in to active operation

at any hour.  Inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage

to undertake new things, she had little of his sanguine temperament which

blinds one to difficulties and possible failures.  She had little

confidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father

out of all his embarrassments and into great wealth, ever since she was

a child; as she grew older, she rather wondered that they were as

prosperous as they seemed to be, and that they did not all go to smash

amid so many brilliant projects.  She was nothing but a woman, and did

not know how much of the business prosperity of the world is only a,

bubble of credit and speculation, one scheme helping to float another

which is no better than it, and the whole liable to come to naught and

confusion as soon as the busy brain that conceived them ceases its power

to devise, or when some accident produces a sudden panic.



"Perhaps, I shall be the stay of the family, yet," said Ruth, with an

approach to gaiety; "When we move into a little house in town, will thee

let me put a little sign on the door: DR. RUTH BOLTON?

Mrs. Dr. Longstreet, thee knows, has a great income."



"Who will pay for the sign, Ruth?" asked Mr. Bolton.



A servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office.  Mr. Bolton

took his letters listlessly, dreading to open them.  He knew well what

they contained, new difficulties, more urgent demands fox money.



"Oh, here is one from Philip.  Poor fellow.  I shall feel his

disappointment as much as my own bad luck.  It is hard to bear when one

is young."



He opened the letter and read.  As he read his face lightened, and he

fetched such a sigh of relief, that Mrs. Bolton and Ruth both exclaimed.



"Read that," he cried, "Philip has found coal!"



The world was changed in a moment.  One little sentence had done it.

There was no more trouble.  Philip had found coal.  That meant relief.

That meant fortune.  A great weight was taken off, and the spirits of the

whole household rose magically.  Good Money! beautiful demon of Money,

what an enchanter thou art!  Ruth felt that she was of less consequence

in the household, now that Philip had found Coal, and perhaps she was not

sorry to feel so.



Mr. Bolton was ten years younger the next morning.  He went into the

city, and showed his letter on change.  It was the sort of news his

friends were quite willing to listen to.  They took a new interest in

him.  If it was confirmed, Bolton would come right up again.  There would

be no difficulty about his getting all the money he wanted.  The money

market did not seem to be half so tight as it was the day before.

Mr. Bolton spent a very pleasant day in his office, and went home

revolving some new plans, and the execution of some projects he had long

been prevented from entering upon by the lack of money.



The day had been spent by Philip in no less excitement.  By daylight,

with Philip's letters to the mail, word had gone down to Ilium that coal

had been found, and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up to

see for themselves.



The "prospecting" continued day and night for upwards of a week, and

during the first four or five days the indications grew more and more

promising, and the telegrams and letters kept Mr. Bolton duly posted.

But at last a change came, and the promises began to fail with alarming

rapidity.  In the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a

doubt that the great "find" was nothing but a worthless seam.



Philip was cast down, all the more so because he had been so foolish as

to send the news to Philadelphia before he knew what he was writing

about.  And now he must contradict it.  "It turns out to be only a mere

seam," he wrote, "but we look upon it as an indication of better further

in."



Alas!  Mr. Bolton's affairs could not wait for "indications."  The future

might have a great deal in store, but the present was black and hopeless.

It was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin.  Yet sacrifice

he must make, and that instantly, in the hope of saving something from

the wreck of his fortune.



His lovely country home must go.  That would bring the most ready money.

The house that he had built with loving thought for each one of his

family, as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it; the

grounds that he had laid out, with so much delight in following the

tastes of his wife, with whom the country, the cultivation of rare trees

and flowers, the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were a

passion almost; this home, which he had hoped his children would enjoy

long after he had done with it, must go.



The family bore the sacrifice better than he did.  They declared in fact

--women are such hypocrites--that they quite enjoyed the city (it was in

August) after living so long in the country, that it was a thousand tunes

more convenient in every respect; Mrs. Bolton said it was a relief from

the worry of a large establishment, and Ruth reminded her father that she

should have had to come to town anyway before long.



Mr. Bolton was relieved, exactly as a water-logged ship is lightened by

throwing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo--but the leak

was not stopped.  Indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by the

prudent step be had taken.  It was regarded as a sure evidence of his

embarrassment, and it was much more difficult for him to obtain help than

if he had, instead of retrenching, launched into some new speculation.



Philip was greatly troubled, and exaggerated his own share in the

bringing about of the calamity.



"You must not look at it so!" Mr. Bolton wrote him.  "You have neither

helped nor hindered--but you know you may help by and by.  It would have

all happened just so, if we had never begun to dig that hole.  That is

only a drop.  Work away.  I still have hope that something will occur to

relieve me.  At any rate we must not give up the mine, so long as we have

any show."



Alas!  the relief did not come.  New misfortunes came instead.  When the

extent of the Bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that

Mr. Bolton could extricate himself, and he had, as an honest man, no

resource except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his

creditors.



The Autumn came and found Philip working with diminished force but still

with hope.  He had again and again been encouraged by good "indications,"

but he had again and again been disappointed.  He could not go on much

longer, and almost everybody except himself had thought it was useless to

go on as long as he had been doing.



When the news came of Mr. Bolton's failure, of course the work stopped.

The men were discharged, the tools were housed, the hopeful noise of

pickman and driver ceased, and the mining camp had that desolate and

mournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated enterprise.



Philip sat down amid the ruins, and almost wished he were buried in them.

How distant Ruth was now from him, now, when she might need him most.

How changed was all the Philadelphia world, which had hitherto stood for

the exemplification of happiness and prosperity.



He still had faith that there was coal in that mountain.  He made

a picture of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel,

digging away with solitary pick and wheelbarrow, day after day and year

after year, until he grew gray and aged, and was known in all that region

as the old man of the mountain.  Perhaps some day--he felt it must be so

some day--he should strike coal.  But what if he did?  Who would be alive

to care for it then?  What would he care for it then?  No, a man wants

riches in his youth, when the world is fresh to him.  He wondered why

Providence could not have reversed the usual process, and let the

majority of men begin with wealth and gradually spend it, and die poor

when they no longer needed it.



Harry went back to the city.  It was evident that his services were no

longer needed.  Indeed, he had letters from his uncle, which he did not

read to Philip, desiring him to go to San Francisco to look after some

government contracts in the harbor there.



Philip had to look about him for something to do; he was like Adam;

the world was all before him whereto choose.  He made, before he went

elsewhere, a somewhat painful visit to Philadelphia, painful but yet not

without its sweetnesses.  The family had never shown him so much

affection before; they all seemed to think his disappointment of more

importance than their own misfortune.  And there was that in Ruth's

manner--in what she gave him and what she withheld--that would have made

a hero of a very much less promising character than Philip Sterling.



Among the assets of the Bolton property, the Ilium tract was sold, and

Philip bought it in at the vendue, for a song, for no one cared to even

undertake the mortgage on it except himself.  He went away the owner of

it, and had ample time before he reached home in November, to calculate

how much poorer he was by possessing it.









CHAPTER L.



It is impossible for the historian, with even the best intentions,

to control events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely

or to be successful.  It is easy to see how things might have been better

managed; a very little change here and there would have made a very,

different history of this one now in hand.



If Philip had adopted some regular profession, even some trade, he might

now be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber, or an honest

lawyer, and have borrowed money at the saving's bank and built a cottage,

and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of Ruth and himself.  Instead

of this, with only a smattering of civil engineering, he is at his

mother's house, fretting and fuming over his ill-luck, and the hardness

and, dishonesty of men, and thinking of nothing but how to get the coal

out of the Ilium hills.



If Senator Dilworthy had not made that visit to Hawkeye, the Hawkins

family and Col. Sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon

Congress, and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of those

appropriations, for the benefit of its members, which the members find it

so difficult to explain to their constituents; and Laura would not be

lying in the Tombs, awaiting her trial for murder, and doing her best,

by the help of able counsel, to corrupt the pure fountain of criminal

procedure in New York.



If Henry Brierly had been blown up on the first Mississippi steamboat he

set foot on, as the chances were that he would be, he and Col. Sellers

never would have gone into the Columbus Navigation scheme, and probably

never into the East Tennessee Land scheme, and he would not now be

detained in New York from very important business operations on the

Pacific coast, for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of

murder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself.

If Mr. Bolton had said the little word "no" to Mr. Bigler, Alice Montague

might now be spending the winter in Philadelphia, and Philip also

(waiting to resume his mining operations in the spring); and Ruth would

not be an assistant in a Philadelphia hospital, taxing her strength with

arduous routine duties, day by day, in order to lighten a little the

burdens that weigh upon her unfortunate family.



It is altogether a bad business.  An honest historian, who had progressed

thus far, and traced everything to such a condition of disaster and

suspension, might well be justified in ending his narrative and writing--

"after this the deluge."  His only consolation would be in the reflection

that he was not responsible for either characters or events.



And the most annoying thought is that a little money, judiciously

applied, would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these people;

but affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult to get

when people need it most.



A little of what Mr. Bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would now

establish his family in a sort of comfort, and relieve Ruth of the

excessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor.

A little money would make a prince of Col. Sellers; and a little more

would calm the anxiety of Washington Hawkins about Laura, for however the

trial ended, he could feel sure of extricating her in the end.  And if

Philip had a little money he could unlock the stone door in the mountain

whence would issue a stream of shining riches.  It needs a golden wand to

strike that rock.  If the Knobs University bill could only go through,

what a change would be wrought in the condition of most of the persons in

this history.  Even Philip himself would feel the good effects of it;

for Harry would have something and Col. Sellers would have something;

and have not both these cautious people expressed a determination to take

an interest in the Ilium mine when they catch their larks?



Philip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to Fallkill.  He

had not been at the Montague's since the tune he saw Ruth there, and he

wanted to consult the Squire about an occupation.  He was determined now

to waste no more time in waiting on Providence, but to go to work at

something, if it were nothing better, than teaching in the Fallkill

Seminary, or digging clams on Hingham beach.  Perhaps he could read law

in Squire Montague's office while earning his bread as a teacher in the

Seminary.



It was not altogether Philip's fault, let us own, that he was in this

position.  There are many young men like him in American society, of his

age, opportunities, education and abilities, who have really been

educated for nothing and have let themselves drift, in the hope that they

will find somehow, and by some sudden turn of good luck, the golden road

to fortune.  He was not idle or lazy, he had energy and a disposition to

carve his own way.  But he was born into a time when all young men of his

age caught the fever of speculation, and expected to get on in the world

by the omission of some of the regular processes which have been

appointed from of old.  And examples were not wanting to encourage him.

He saw people, all around him, poor yesterday, rich to-day, who had come

into sudden opulence by some means which they could not have classified

among any of the regular occupations of life.  A war would give such a

fellow a career and very likely fame.  He might have been a "railroad

man," or a politician, or a land speculator, or one of those mysterious

people who travel free on all rail-roads and steamboats, and are

continually crossing and recrossing the Atlantic, driven day and night

about nobody knows what, and make a great deal of money by so doing.

Probably, at last, he sometimes thought with a whimsical smile, he should

end by being an insurance agent, and asking people to insure their lives

for his benefit.



Possibly Philip did not think how much the attractions of Fallkill were

increased by the presence of Alice there.  He had known her so long, she

had somehow grown into his life by habit, that he would expect the

pleasure of her society without thinking mach about it.  Latterly he

never thought of her without thinking of Ruth, and if he gave the subject

any attention, it was probably in an undefined consciousness that, he had

her sympathy in his love, and that she was always willing to hear him

talk about it.  If he ever wondered that Alice herself was not in love

and never spoke of the possibility of her own marriage, it was a

transient thought for love did not seem necessary, exactly, to one so

calm and evenly balanced and with so many resources in her herself.



Whatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to Philip, as they

are to these historians; if she was seeming to be what she was not, and

carrying a burden heavier than any one else carried, because she had to

bear it alone, she was only doing what thousands of women do, with a

self-renunciation and heroism, of which men, impatient and complaining,

have no conception.  Have not these big babies with beards filled all

literature with their outcries, their griefs and their lamentations?  It

is always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and

implacable.



"Do you think you would be contented to live in Fallkill, and attend the

county Court?" asked Alice, when Philip had opened the budget of his new

programme.



"Perhaps not always," said Philip, "I might go and practice in Boston

maybe, or go to Chicago."



"Or you might get elected to Congress."



Philip looked at Alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing him.

Her face was quite sober.  Alice was one of those patriotic women in the

rural districts, who think men are still selected for Congress on account

of qualifications for the office.



"No," said Philip, "the chances are that a man cannot get into congress

now without resorting to arts and means that should render hint unfit to

go there; of course there are exceptions; but do you know that I could

not go into politics if I were a lawyer, without losing standing somewhat

in my profession, and without raising at least a suspicion of my

intentions and unselfishness?  Why, it is telegraphed all over the

country and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes

honestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position to

steal from the government."



"But," insisted Alice, "I should think it a noble ambition to go to

congress, if it is so bad, and help reform it.  I don't believe it is as

corrupt as the English parliament used to be, if there is any truth in

the novels, and I suppose that is reformed."



"I'm sure I don't know where the reform is to begin.  I've seen a

perfectly capable, honest man, time and again, run against an illiterate

trickster, and get beaten.  I suppose if the people wanted decent members

of congress they would elect them.  Perhaps," continued Philip with a

smile, "the women will have to vote."



"Well, I should be willing to, if it were a necessity, just as I would go

to war and do what I could, if the country couldn't be saved otherwise,"

said Alice, with a spirit that surprised Philip, well as he thought he

knew her.  "If I were a young gentleman in these times--"



Philip laughed outright.  "It's just what Ruth used to say, 'if she were

a man.' I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of

sex."



"No, only a changed sex," retorted Alice; "we contemplate for the most

part young men who don't care for anything they ought to care for."



"Well," said Philip, looking humble, "I care for some things, you and

Ruth for instance; perhaps I ought not to.  Perhaps I ought to care for

Congress and that sort of thing."



"Don't be a goose, Philip.  I heard from Ruth yesterday."



"Can I see her letter?"



"No, indeed.  But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her, together

with her anxiety about her father."



"Do you think, Alice," asked Philip with one of those selfish thoughts

that are not seldom mixed with real love, "that Ruth prefers her

profession to--to marriage?"



"Philip," exclaimed Alice, rising to quit the room, and speaking

hurriedly as if the words were forced from her, "you are as blind as a

bat; Ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute."



Philip never noticed that Alice's face was flushed and that her voice was

unsteady; he only thought of the delicious words he had heard.  And the

poor girl, loyal to Ruth, loyal to Philip, went straight to her room,

locked the door, threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her heart

world break.  And then she prayed that her Father in Heaven would give

her strength.  And after a time she was calm again, and went to her

bureau drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper,

yellow with age.  Upon it was pinned a four-leaved clover, dry and yellow

also.  She looked long at this foolish memento.  Under the clover leaf

was written in a school-girl's hand--"Philip, June, 186-."



Squire Montague thought very well of Philip's proposal.  It would have

been better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left

college, but it was not too late now, and besides he had gathered some

knowledge of the world.



"But," asked the Squire, "do you mean to abandon your land in

Pennsylvania?"  This track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to

this New England lawyer-farmer.  Hasn't it good timber, and doesn't the

railroad almost touch it?"



"I can't do anything with it now.  Perhaps I can sometime."



"What is your reason for supposing that there is coal there?"



"The opinion of the best geologist I could consult, my own observation

of the country, and the little veins of it we found.  I feel certain it

is there.  I shall find it some day.  I know it.  If I can only keep the

land till I make money enough to try again."



Philip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region, and

pointed out the position of the Ilium mountain which he had begun to

tunnel.



"Doesn't it look like it?"



"It certainly does," said the Squire, very much interested.  It is not

unusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such a

venture than a speculator who, has had more experience in its

uncertainty.  It was astonishing how many New England clergymen, in the

time of the petroleum excitement, took chances in oil.  The Wall street

brokers are said to do a good deal of small business for country

clergymen, who are moved no doubt with the laudable desire of purifying

the New York stock board.



"I don't see that there is much risk," said the Squire, at length.

"The timber is worth more than the mortgage; and if that coal seam does

run there, it's a magnificent fortune.  Would you like to try it again in

the spring, Phil?"



Like to try it!  If he could have a little help, he would work himself,

with pick and barrow, and live on a crust.  Only give him one more

chance.



And this is how it came about that the cautious old Squire Montague was

drawn into this young fellow's speculation, and began to have his serene

old age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke of luck.



"To be sure, I only care about it for the boy," he said.  The Squire was

like everybody else; sooner or later he must "take a chance."



It is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that they

are not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men.  It is

only when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of

gambling.  Neither Alice nor Ruth were much elated with the prospect of

Philip's renewal of his mining enterprise.



But Philip was exultant.  He wrote to Ruth as if his fortune were already

made, and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of Bolton were

already in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried.  Towards spring he went

to Philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign.  His

enthusiasm was irresistible.



"Philip has come, Philip has come," cried the children, as if some great

good had again come into the household; and the refrain even sang itself

over in Ruth's heart as she went the weary hospital rounds.  Mr. Bolton

felt more courage than he had had in months, at the sight of his manly

face and the sound of his cheery voice.



Ruth's course was vindicated now, and it certainly did not become Philip,

who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible result

of her determination and industry, to open an argument with her.  Ruth

was never more certain that she was right and that she was sufficient

unto herself.  She, may be, did not much heed the still small voice that

sang in her maiden heart as she went about her work, and which lightened

it and made it easy, "Philip has come."



"I am glad for father's sake," she said to Philip, that thee has come.

I can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do.  He thinks women

won't hold out long," added Ruth with the smile that Philip never exactly

understood.



"And aren't you tired sometimes of the struggle?"



"Tired?  Yes, everybody is tired I suppose.  But it is a glorious

profession.  And would you want me to be dependent, Philip?"



"Well, yes, a little," said Philip, feeling his way towards what he

wanted to say.



"On what, for instance, just now?" asked Ruth, a little maliciously

Philip thought.



"Why, on--" he couldn't quite say it, for it occurred to him that he was

a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his fortune,

and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he was.



"I don't mean depend," he began again.  "But I love you, that's all.  Am

I nothing--to you?" And Philip looked a little defiant, and as if he had

said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of obligation

on either side, between man and woman.



Perhaps Ruth saw this.  Perhaps she saw that her own theories of a

certain equality of power, which ought to precede a union of two hearts,

might be pushed too far.  Perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness

and the need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest

confessed, as that which Philip could give.  Whatever moved her--the

riddle is as old as creation--she simply looked up to Philip and said in

a low voice, "Everything."



And Philip clasping both her hands in his, and looking down into her

eyes, which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true woman's

nature--
