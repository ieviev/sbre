    The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars.
    They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings
    for the reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon they
    had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again!  And they
    did.

    We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at
    the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and
    crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great
    pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and
    shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon
    I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great
    public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true
    cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns.
    We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the
    Azores, but no nails.  They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that
    archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the
    wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft
    the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter.  His
    noble effort cost him his life.  He was shot dead.  They showed us a cast
    of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two
    vertebrae in which it lodged.  These people have a somewhat singular
    taste in the matter of relics.  Ferguson told us that the silver cross
    which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into
    the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then
    an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did
    dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame,
    to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of
    miraculous intervention.

Chair; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair there
when the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said she
would never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the

"Now, Tom Sawyer, what kind of a lie are you fixing YOUR
mouth to contribit to this mess of rubbage? Speak out--and
I warn you before you begin, that I don't believe a word
of it.  You and Huck's been up to something you no business
to--I know it perfectly well; I know you, BOTH of you.
Now you explain that dog, and them blackberries,
and the lantern, and the rest of that rot--and mind you
talk as straight as a string--do you hear?"

Tom he looked considerable hurt, and says, very dignified:

"It is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way,
just for making a little bit of a mistake that anybody
could make."

"What mistake has he made?"

"Why, only the mistake of saying blackberries when
of course he meant strawberries."

"Tom Sawyer, I lay if you aggravate me a little more, I'll--"

intending it--you are in the wrong.  If you'd 'a' studied

the words out fast enough, and she gushed them out
in one everlasting freshet.  That was what Tom Sawyer
was after.  He allowed to work her up and get her started
and then leave her alone and let her burn herself out.
Then she would be so aggravated with that subject
that she wouldn't say another word about it, nor let AAAAAAAAAAA
anybody else.  Well, it happened just so.  When she
was tuckered out and had to hold up, he says, quite ca'm:

"Shet up!" she says, "I don't want to hear another word
out of you."
